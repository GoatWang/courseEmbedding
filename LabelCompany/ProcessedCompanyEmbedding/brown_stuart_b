was a united states army officer from the us state of virginia who later became a confederate states army general during the american civil war he was known to his friends as jeb from the initials of his given names stuart was a cavalry commander known for his mastery of reconnaissance and the use of cavalry in support of offensive operations while he cultivated a cavalier image redlined gray cape yellow sash hat cocked to the side with an ostrich plume red flower in his lapel often sporting cologne his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of robert e lees army and inspired southern morale stuart graduated from west point in  and served in texas and kansas with the us army he was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with native americans and the violence of bleeding kansas and he participated in the capture of john brown at harpers ferry he resigned when his home state of virginia seceded to serve in the confederate army first under stonewall jackson in the shenandoah valley but then in increasingly important cavalry commands of the army of northern virginia playing a role in all of that armys campaigns until his death he established a reputation as an audacious cavalry commander and on two occasions during the peninsula campaign and the maryland campaign circumnavigated the union army of the potomac bringing fame to himself and embarrassment to the north at the battle of chancellorsville he distinguished himself as a temporary commander of the wounded stonewall jacksons infantry corps arguably stuarts most famous campaign gettysburg was marred when he was surprised by a union cavalry attack at the battle of brandy station and by his separation from lees army for an extended period leaving lee unaware of union troop movements and contributing to the confederate defeat at the battle of gettysburg stuart received significant criticism from the southern press as well as the postbellum proponents of the lost cause movement but historians have failed to agree on whether stuarts exploit was entirely the fault of his judgment or simply a result of bad luck and lees lessthanexplicit orders during the  overland campaign union maj gen philip sheridans

was of scottish american and scotsirish background he was the eighth of eleven children and the youngest of the five sons to survive past early age his greatgrandfather major alexander stuart commanded a regiment at the battle of guilford court house during the american revolutionary war his father archibald stuart was a war of  veteran slaveholder attorney and democratic politician who represented patrick county in both houses of the virginia general assembly and also served one term in the united states house of representatives archibald was a cousin of alexander hugh holmes stuart elizabeth letcher pannill stuart jebs mother who was known as a strict religious woman with a good sense for business ran the family farm educationedit a young stuart stuart was educated at home by his mother and tutors until the age of twelve when he left laurel hill to be educated by various teachers in wytheville virginia and at the home of his aunt anne archibalds sister and her husband judge james ewell brown stuarts namesake at danville he entered emory and henry college when he was fifteen and attended from  to  during the summer of  stuart attempted to enlist in the us army but was rejected as underaged he obtained an appointment in  to the united states military academy at west point new york from representative thomas hamlet averett the man who had defeated his father in the  election stuart was a popular student and was happy at the academy although not handsome in his teen years his classmates called him by the nickname beauty which they described as his personal comeliness in inverse ratio to the term employed he possessed a chin so short and retiring as positively to disfigure his otherwise fine countenance he quickly grew a beard after graduation and a fellow officer remarked that he was the only man he ever saw that a beard improved robert e lee was appointed superintendent of the academy in  and stuart became a friend of the lee family seeing them socially on frequent occasions lees nephew fitzhugh lee also arrived at the academy in  in stuarts final year in addition to achieving the cadet rank of second captain of the corps he was one of eight cadets designated as honorary cavalry officers for his skills in horsemanship stuart graduated th in his class of  in  he ranked tenth in his class in cavalry tactics although he enjoyed the civil engineering curriculum at the academy and did well in mathematics his poor drawing skills hampered his engineering studies and he finished th in that discipline a stuart family tradition says he deliberately degraded his academic performance in his final year to avoid service in the elite but dull corps of engineers united states armyedit stuart was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant and assigned to the us regiment of mounted riflemen in texas after an arduous journey he reached fort davis on january   and was a leader for three months on scouting missions over the san antonio to el paso road he was soon transferred to the newly formed st cavalry regiment  at fort leavenworth kansas territory where he became regimental quartermaster and commissary officer under the command of col edwin v sumner he was promoted to first lieutenant in  also in  stuart met flora cooke the daughter of the commander of the nd us dragoon regiment lieutenant colonel philip st george cooke burke davis described flora as an accomplished horsewoman and though not pretty an effective charmer to whom stuart succumbed with hardly a struggle  they became engaged in september less than two months after meeting stuart humorously wrote of his rapid courtship in latin veni vidi victus sum i came i saw i was conquered although a gala wedding was planned for fort riley kansas the death of stuarts father on september  caused a change of plans and the marriage on november  was small and limited to family witnesses the couple owned two slaves until  one inherited from his fathers estate the other purchased stuarts leadership capabilities were soon recognized he was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with native americans and the antebellum violence of bleeding kansas he was wounded on july   while fighting at solomon river kansas against the cheyenne col sumner ordered a charge with drawn sabers against a wave of indian arrows scattering the warriors stuart and three other lieutenants chased one down whom stuart wounded in the thigh with his pistol the cheyenne turned and fired at stuart with an oldfashioned pistol striking him in the chest with a bullet which did little more damage than to pierce the skin stuart returned in september to fort leavenworth and was reunited with his wife their first child a girl had been born in  but died the same day on november   flora gave birth to another daughter whom the parents named flora after her mother the family relocated in early  to fort riley where they remained for three years in  stuart developed a new piece of cavalry equipment for which he received patent number  on october —a saber hook or an improved method of attaching sabers to belts the us government paid stuart  for a right to use license and stuart contracted with knorr nece and co of philadelphia to manufacture his hook while in washington dc to discuss government contracts and in conjunction with his application for an appointment into the

secession of virginia his letter of resignation sent from cairo illinois was accepted by the war department on may  upon learning that his fatherinlaw col cooke would remain in the us army during the

lieutenant colonel of virginia infantry in the confederate army on may   maj gen robert e lee now commanding the armed forces of virginia ordered him to report to colonel thomas j jackson at harpers ferry jackson chose to ignore stuarts infantry designation and assigned him on july  to command all the cavalry companies of the army of the shenandoah organized as the st virginia cavalry regiment he was promoted to colonel on july  stuart is a rare man wonderfully endowed by nature with the qualities necessary for an officer of light cavalry  calm firm acute active and enterprising i know no one more competent than he to estimate the occurrences before him at their true value if you add to this army a real brigade of cavalry you can find no better brigadiergeneral to command it general joseph e johnston letter to confederate president jefferson davis august  after early service in the shenandoah valley stuart led his regiment in the first battle of bull run and participated in the pursuit of the retreating federals he then commanded the armys outposts along the upper potomac river until given command of the cavalry brigade for the army then known as the army of the potomac later named the army of northern virginia he was promoted to brigadier general on september   peninsulaedit in  the union army of the potomac began its peninsula campaign against richmond virginia and stuarts cavalry brigade assisted gen joseph e johnstons army as it withdrew up the virginia peninsula in the face of superior numbers stuart fought at the battle of williamsburg but in general the terrain and weather on the peninsula did not lend themselves to cavalry operations however when gen robert e lee became commander of the army of northern virginia he requested that stuart perform reconnaissance to determine whether the right flank of the union army was vulnerable stuart set out with  troopers on the morning of june  and having determined that the flank was indeed vulnerable took his men on a complete circumnavigation of the union army returning after  miles on july  with  captured union soldiers  horses and mules and various quartermaster and ordnance supplies his men met no serious opposition from the more decentralized union cavalry coincidentally commanded by his fatherinlaw col cooke the maneuver was a public relations sensation and stuart was greeted with flower petals thrown in his path at richmond he had become as famous as stonewall jackson in the eyes of the confederacy northern virginiaedit confederate cavalry general jeb stuart early in the northern virginia campaign stuart was promoted to major general on july   and his command was upgraded to the cavalry division he was nearly captured and lost his signature plumed hat and cloak to pursuing federals during a raid in august but in a retaliatory raid at catletts station the following day managed to overrun union army commander maj gen john popes headquarters and not only captured popes full uniform but also intercepted orders that provided lee with valuable intelligence concerning reinforcements for popes army at the second battle of bull run second manassas stuarts cavalry followed the massive assault by longstreets infantry against popes army protecting its flank with artillery batteries stuart ordered brig gen beverly robertsons brigade to pursue the federals and in a sharp fight against brig gen john bufords brigade col thomas t munfords nd virginia cavalry was overwhelmed until stuart sent in two more regiments as reinforcements bufords men many of whom were new to combat retreated across lewiss ford and stuarts troopers captured over  of them stuarts men harassed the retreating union columns until the campaign ended at the battle of chantilly marylandedit during the maryland campaign of september  stuarts cavalry screened the armys movement north he bears some responsibility for robert e lees lack of knowledge of the position and celerity of the pursuing army of the potomac under george b mcclellan for a fiveday period stuart rested his men and entertained local civilians at a gala ball at urbana maryland his reports make no reference to intelligence gathering by his scouts or patrols as the union army drew near to lees divided army stuarts men skirmished at various points on the approach to frederick and stuart was not able to keep his brigades concentrated enough to resist the oncoming tide he misjudged the union routes of advance ignorant of the union force threatening turners gap and required assistance from the infantry of maj gen dh hill to defend the south mountain passes in the battle of south mountain his horse artillery bombarded the flank of the union army as it opened its attack in the battle of antietam by midafternoon stonewall jackson ordered stuart to command a turning movement with his cavalry against the union right flank and rear which if successful would be followed up by an infantry attack from the west woods stuart began probing the union lines with more artillery barrages which were answered with murderous counterbattery fire and the cavalry movement intended by jackson was never launched stuart and jackson were an unlikely pair one outgoing the other introverted one flashily uniformed the other plainly dressed one prince rupert and the other cromwell yet stuarts selfconfidence penchant for action deep love of virginia and total abstinence from such vices as alcohol tobacco and pessimism endeared him to jackson  stuart was the only man in the confederacy who could make jackson laugh—and who dared to do so james i robertson jr stonewall jackson three weeks after lees army had withdrawn back to virginia on october –  stuart performed another of his audacious circumnavigations of the army of the potomac his chambersburg raid— miles in under  hours from darkesville west virginia to as far north as mercersburg pennsylvania and chambersburg and around to the east through emmitsburg maryland and south through hyattstown maryland and whites ford to leesburg virginia—once again embarrassing his union opponents and seizing horses and supplies but at the expense of exhausted men and animals without gaining much military advantage jubal early referred to it as the greatest horse stealing expedition that only annoyed the enemy stuart gave his friend jackson a fine new officers tunic trimmed with gold lace commissioned from a richmond tailor which he thought would give jackson more of the appearance of a proper general something to which jackson was notoriously indifferent mcclellan pushed his army slowly south urged by president lincoln to pursue lee crossing the potomac starting on october  as lee began moving to counter this stuart screened longstreets corps and skirmished numerous times in early november against union cavalry and infantry around mountville aldie and upperville on november  stuart received sad news by telegram that his daughter flora had died just before her fifth birthday of typhoid fever on november  fredericksburg and chancellorsvilleedit in the december  battle of fredericksburg stuart and his cavalry—most notably his horse artillery under major john pelham—protected stonewall jacksons flank at hamiltons crossing general lee commended his cavalry which effectually guarded our right annoying the enemy and embarrassing his movements by hanging on his flank and attacking when the opportunity occurred stuart reported to flora the next day that he had been shot through his fur collar but was unhurt after christmas lee ordered stuart to conduct a raid north of the rappahannock river to penetrate the enemys rear ascertain if possible his position  movements  inflict upon him such damage as circumstances will permit with  troopers and a horse artillery battery assigned to the operation stuarts raid reached as far north as four miles south of fairfax court house seizing  prisoners horses mules and supplies tapping telegraph lines his signalmen intercepted messages between union commanders and stuart sent a personal telegram to union quartermaster general montgomery c meigs general meigs will in the future please furnish better mules those you have furnished recently are very inferior on march   stuarts cavalry clashed with a union raiding party at kellys ford the minor victory was marred by the death of major pelham which caused stuart profound grief as he thought of him as close as a younger brother he wrote to a confederate congressman the noble the chivalric the gallant pelham is no more  let the tears of agony we have shed and the gloom of mourning throughout my command bear witness flora was pregnant at the time and stuart told her that if it were a boy he wanted him to be named john pelham stuart virginia pelham stuart was born october  chancellorsville may     confederaterebels   unionfederals at the battle of chancellorsville stuart accompanied stonewall jackson on his famous flanking march of may   and started to pursue the retreating soldiers of the union xi corps when he received word that both jackson and his senior division commander maj gen ap hill had been wounded hill bypassing the next most senior infantry general in the corps brig gen robert e rodes sent a message ordering stuart to take command of the second corps although the delays associated with this change of command effectively ended the flanking attack the night of may  stuart performed credibly as an infantry corps commander the following day launching a strong and wellcoordinated attack against the union right flank at chancellorsville when union troops abandoned hazel grove stuart had the presence of mind to quickly occupy it and bombard the union positions with artillery stuart relinquished his infantry command on may  when hill returned to duty stephen w sears wrote  it is hard to see how jeb stuart in a new command a cavalryman commanding infantry and artillery for the first time could have done a better job the astute porter alexander believed all credit was due altogether i do not think there was a more brilliant thing done in the war than stuarts extricating that command from the extremely critical position in which he found it stonewall jackson died on may  and stuart was once again devastated by the loss of a close friend telling his staff that the death was a national calamity jacksons wife mary anna wrote to stuart on august  thanking him for a note of sympathy i need not assure you of which you already know that your friendship  admiration were cordially reciprocated by him i have frequently heard him speak of genl stuart as one of his warm personal friends  also express admiration for your soldierly qualities brandy stationedit the grand review of june  was surely the proudest day of jeb stuarts thirty years as he led a cavalcade of resplendent staff officers to the reviewing stand trumpeters heralded his coming and women and girls strewed his path with flowers before all of the spectators the assembled cavalry brigade stretched a mile and a half after stuart and his entourage galloped past the line in review the troopers in their turn saluted the reviewing stand in columns of squadrons in performing a second march past the squadrons started off at a trot then spurred to a gallop drawing sabers and breaking into the rebel yell the troopers rush toward the horse artillery drawn up in battery the gunners responded defiantly firing blank charges amidst this tumult of cannon fire and thundering hooves a number of ladies swooned in their escorts arms stephen w sears gettysburg battle of brandy station june   returning to the cavalry for the gettysburg campaign stuart endured the two low points in his career starting with the battle of brandy station the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war by june  two of lees infantry corps were camped in and around culpeper six miles northeast holding the line of the rappahannock river stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers mostly near brandy station screening the confederate army against surprise by the enemy stuart requested a full field review of his troops by gen lee this grand review on june  included nearly  mounted troopers and four batteries of horse artillery charging in simulated battle at inlet station about two miles three km southwest of brandy station lee was not able to attend the review however so it was repeated in his presence on june  although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations despite the lower level of activity some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all stuart was doing was feeding his ego and exhausting the horses lee ordered stuart to cross the rappahannock the next day and raid union forward positions screening the confederate army from observation or interference as it moved north anticipating this imminent offensive action stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around brandy station army of the potomac commander maj gen joseph hooker interpreted stuarts presence around culpeper to be indicative of preparations for a raid on his armys supply lines in reaction he ordered his cavalry commander maj gen alfred pleasonton to take a combined arms force of  cavalrymen and  infantry on a spoiling raid to disperse and destroy the  confederates pleasontons force crossed the rappahannock in two columns on june   the first crossing at beverlys ford brig gen john bufords division catching stuart by surprise waking him and his staff to the sound of gunfire the second crossing at kellys ford surprised stuart again and the confederates found themselves assaulted from front and rear in a spirited melee of mounted combat a series of confusing charges and countercharges swept back and forth across fleetwood hill which had been stuarts headquarters the previous night after ten hours of fighting pleasonton ordered his men to withdraw across the rappahannock if gen stuart is to be the eyes and ears of the army we advise him to see more and be seen less  gen stuart has suffered no little in public estimation by the late enterprises of the enemy richmond enquirer june   although stuart claimed a victory because the confederates held the field brandy station is considered a tactical draw and both sides came up short pleasonton was not able to disable stuarts force at the start of an important campaign and he withdrew before finding the location of lees infantry nearby however the fact that the southern cavalry had not detected the movement of two large columns of union cavalry and that they fell victim to a surprise attack was an embarrassment that prompted serious criticism from fellow generals and the southern press the fight also revealed the increased competency of the union cavalry and foreshadowed the decline of the formerly invincible southern mounted arm stuarts ride in the gettysburg campaignedit further information gettysburg campaign stuarts ride shown with a red dotted line during the gettysburg campaign june  – july   following a series of small cavalry battles in june as lees army began marching north through the shenandoah valley stuart may have had in mind the glory of circumnavigating the enemy army once again desiring to erase the stain on his reputation of the surprise at brandy station general lee gave orders to stuart on june  on how he was to participate in the march north and the exact nature of those orders has been argued by the participants and historians ever since but the essence was that he was instructed to guard the mountain passes with part of his force while the army of northern virginia was still south of the potomac and that he was to cross the river with the remainder of the army and screen the right flank of ewells second corps instead of taking a direct route north near the blue ridge mountains however stuart chose to reach ewells flank by taking his three best brigades those of brig gen wade hampton brig gen fitzhugh lee and col john r chambliss the latter replacing the wounded brig gen whf rooney lee between the union army and washington moving north through rockville to westminster and on into pennsylvania hoping to capture supplies along the way and cause havoc near the enemy capital stuart and his three brigades departed salem depot at  am on june  unfortunately for stuarts plan the union armys movement was underway and his proposed route was blocked by columns of federal infantry forcing him to veer farther to the east than either he or general lee had anticipated this prevented stuart from linking up with ewell as ordered and deprived lee of the use of his prime cavalry force the eyes and ears of the army while advancing into unfamiliar enemy territory stuarts command crossed the potomac river at  am on june  at rockville they captured a wagon train of  brandnew fully loaded wagons and mule teams this wagon train would prove to be a logistical hindrance to stuarts advance but he interpreted lees orders as placing importance on gathering supplies the proximity of the confederate raiders provoked some consternation in the national capital and two union cavalry brigades and an artillery battery were sent to pursue the confederates stuart supposedly said that were it not for his fatigued horses he would have marched down the th street road and took abe  cabinet prisoners in westminster on june  his men clashed briefly with and overwhelmed two companies of union cavalry chasing them a long distance on the baltimore road which stuart claimed caused a great panic in the city of baltimore the head of stuarts column encountered brig gen judson kilpatricks cavalry as it passed through hanover and scattered it on june  the battle of hanover ended after kilpatricks men regrouped and drove the confederates out of town stuarts brigades had been better positioned to guard their captured wagon train than to take advantage of the encounter with kilpatrick after a mile trek in the dark his exhausted men reached dover on the morning of july  as the battle of gettysburg was commencing without them stuart headed next for carlisle hoping to find ewell he lobbed a few shells into town during the early evening of july  and burned the carlisle barracks before withdrawing to the south towards gettysburg he and the bulk of his command reached lee at gettysburg the afternoon of july  he ordered wade hampton to cover the left rear of the confederate battle lines and hampton fought with brig gen george armstrong custer at the battle of hunterstown before joining stuart at gettysburg gettysburg and its aftermath edit when stuart arrived at gettysburg on the afternoon of july —bringing with him the caravan of captured union supply wagons—he received a rare rebuke from lee no one witnessed the private meeting between lee and stuart but reports circulated at headquarters that lees greeting was abrupt and frosty colonel edward porter alexander wrote although lee said only well general you are here at last his manner implied rebuke and it was so understood by stuart on the final day of the battle stuart was ordered to get into the enemys rear and disrupt its line of communications at the same time picketts charge was sent against the union positions on cemetery ridge but his attack on east cavalry field was repulsed by union cavalry under brig gens david gregg and george custer during the retreat from gettysburg stuart devoted his full attention to supporting the armys movement successfully screening against aggressive union cavalry pursuit and escorting thousands of wagons with wounded men and captured supplies over difficult roads and through inclement weather numerous skirmishes and minor battles occurred during the screening and delaying actions of the retreat stuarts men were the final units to cross the potomac river returning to virginia in wretched condition—completely worn out and broken down the failure to crush the federal army in pennsylvania in  in the opinion of almost all of the officers of the army of northern virginia can be expressed in five words—the absence of the cavalry confederate maj gen henry heth the gettysburg campaign was the most controversial of stuarts career he became one of the scapegoats along with james longstreet blamed for lees loss at gettysburg by proponents of the postbellum lost cause movement such as jubal early this was fueled in part by opinions of less partisan writers such as stuarts subordinate thomas l rosser who stated after the war that stuart did on this campaign undoubtedly make the fatal blunder which lost us the battle of gettysburg in general lees report on the campaign he wrote  the absence of the cavalry rendered it impossible to obtain accurate information  by the route stuart pursued the federal army was interposed between his command and our main body preventing any communication with him until his arrival at carlisle the march toward gettysburg was conducted more slowly than it would have been had the movements of the federal army been known one of the most forceful postbellum defenses of stuart was by col john s mosby who had served under him during the campaign and was fiercely loyal to the late general writing he made me all that i was in the war  but for his friendship i would never have been heard of he wrote numerous articles for popular publications and published a book length treatise in  a work that relied on his skills as a lawyer to refute categorically all of the claims laid against stuart modern scholarship remains divided on stuarts culpability edward g longacre argues that lee deliberately gave stuart wide discretion in his orders and had no complaints about stuarts tardy arrival at gettysburg because he established no date by which the cavalry was required to link up with ewell the ½ brigades of cavalry left with the main army were adequate for lee to negotiate enemy territory safely and that his choice not to use these brigades effectively cannot be blamed on stuart edwin b coddington refers to the tragedy of stuart in the gettysburg campaign and judges that when fitzhugh lee raised the question of whether stuart exercised the discretion undoubtedly given to him judiciously the answer is no nevertheless replying to historians who maintain that stuarts absence permitted lee to be surprised at gettysburg coddington points out that the union commander maj gen george meade was just as surprised and the initial advantage lay with lee eric j wittenberg and j david petruzzi have concluded that there was plenty of blame to go around and the fault should be divided between stuart the lack of specificity in lees orders and richard s ewell who might have tried harder to link up with stuart northeast of gettysburg jeffry d wert acknowledges that lee his officers and fighting by the army of the potomac bear the responsibility for the confederate loss at gettysburg but states that stuart failed lee and the army in the reckoning at gettysburg  lee trusted him and gave him discretion but stuart acted injudiciously although stuart was not reprimanded or disciplined in any official way for his role in the gettysburg campaign it is noteworthy that his appointment to corps command on september   did not carry with it a promotion to lieutenant general edward bonekemper wrote that since all other corps commanders in the army of northern virginia carried this rank lees decision to keep stuart at major general rank while at the same time promoting stuarts subordinates wade hampton and fitzhugh lee to major generals could be considered an implied rebuke jeffry d wert wrote that there is no evidence lee considered stuarts performance during the gettysburg campaign and that it is more likely that lee thought the responsibilities in command of a cavalry corps did not equal those of an infantry corps fall  and the  overland campaignedit the cavalrys success in the bristoe campaign can be attributed to the generalship boldness and untiring energy of majorgeneral stuart for it was he who directed every movement of importance and his generalship boldness and energy won the unbounded confidence of officers and men and gave the prestige of success confederate colonel oliver funsten bristoe campaign the  overland campaign including the battle of yellow tavern lee reorganized his cavalry on september  creating a cavalry corps for stuart with two divisions of three brigades each in the bristoe campaign stuart was assigned to lead a broad turning movement in an attempt to get into the enemys rear but general meade skillfully withdrew his army without leaving stuart any opportunities to take advantage of on october  stuart blundered into the rear guard of the union iii corps near warrenton ewells corps was sent to rescue him but stuart hid his troopers in a wooded ravine until the unsuspecting iii corps moved on and the assistance was not necessary as meade withdrew towards manassas junction brigades from the union ii corps fought a rearguard action against stuarts cavalry and the infantry of brig gen harry hayss division near auburn on october  stuarts cavalry boldly bluffed warrens infantry and escaped disaster after the confederate repulse at bristoe station and an aborted advance on centreville stuarts cavalry shielded the withdrawal of lees army from the vicinity of manassas junction judson kilpatricks union cavalry pursued stuarts cavalry along the warrenton turnpike but were lured into an ambush near chestnut hill and routed the federal troopers were scattered and chased five miles eight km in an affair that came to be known as the buckland races the southern press began to mute its criticism of stuart following his successful performance during the fall campaign the overland campaign lt gen ulysses s grants offensive against lee in the spring of  began at the battle of the wilderness where stuart aggressively pushed thomas l rossers laurel brigade into a fight against george custers betterarmed michigan brigade resulting in significant losses general lee sent a message to stuart it is very important to save your cavalry  not wear it out  you must use your good judgment to make any attack which may offer advantages as the armies maneuvered toward their next confrontation at spotsylvania court house stuarts cavalry fought delaying actions against the union cavalry his defense at laurel

organized a raid against confederate supply and railroad lines close to richmond which he knew would bring stuart to battle sheridan moved aggressively to the southeast crossing the north anna river and seizing beaver dam station on the virginia central railroad where his men captured a train liberating  union prisoners and destroying more than one million rations and medical supplies destined

officer from the us state of virginia who later became a confederate states army general during the american civil war he was known to his friends as jeb from the initials of his given names stuart was a cavalry commander known for his mastery of reconnaissance and the use of cavalry in support of offensive operations while he cultivated a cavalier image redlined gray cape yellow sash hat cocked to the side with an ostrich plume red flower in his lapel often sporting cologne his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of robert e lees army and inspired southern morale stuart graduated from west point in  and served in texas and kansas with the us army he was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with native americans and the violence of bleeding kansas and he participated in the capture of john brown at harpers ferry he resigned when his home state of virginia seceded to serve in the confederate army first under stonewall jackson in the shenandoah valley but then in increasingly important cavalry commands of the army of northern virginia playing a role in all of that armys campaigns until his death he established a reputation as an audacious cavalry commander and on two occasions during the peninsula campaign and the maryland campaign circumnavigated the union army of the potomac bringing fame to himself and embarrassment to the north at the battle of chancellorsville he distinguished himself as a temporary commander of the wounded stonewall jacksons infantry corps arguably stuarts most famous campaign gettysburg was marred when he was surprised by a union cavalry attack at the battle of brandy station and by his separation from lees army for an extended period leaving lee unaware of union troop movements and contributing to the confederate defeat at the battle of gettysburg stuart received significant criticism from the southern press as well as the postbellum proponents of the lost cause movement but historians have failed to agree on whether stuarts exploit was entirely the fault of his judgment or simply a result of bad luck and lees lessthanexplicit orders during the  overland campaign union maj gen philip sheridans cavalry

was rejected as underaged he obtained an appointment in  to the united states military academy at west point new york from representative thomas hamlet averett the man who had defeated his father in the  election stuart was a popular student and was happy at the academy although not handsome in his teen years his classmates called him by the nickname beauty which they described as his personal comeliness in inverse ratio to the term employed he possessed a chin so short and retiring as positively to disfigure his otherwise fine countenance he quickly grew a beard after graduation and a fellow officer remarked that he was the only man he ever saw that a beard improved robert e lee was appointed superintendent of the academy in  and stuart became a friend of the lee family seeing them socially on frequent occasions lees nephew fitzhugh lee also arrived at the academy in  in stuarts final year in addition to achieving the cadet rank of second captain of the corps he was one of eight cadets designated as honorary cavalry officers for his skills in horsemanship stuart graduated th in his class of  in  he ranked tenth in his class in cavalry tactics although he enjoyed the civil engineering curriculum at the academy and did well in mathematics his poor drawing skills hampered his engineering studies and he finished th in that discipline a stuart family tradition says he deliberately degraded his academic performance in his final year to avoid service in the elite but dull corps of engineers united states armyedit stuart was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant and assigned to the us regiment of mounted riflemen in texas after an arduous journey he reached fort davis on january   and was a leader for three months on scouting missions over the san antonio to el paso road he was soon transferred to the newly formed st cavalry regiment  at fort leavenworth kansas territory where he became regimental quartermaster and commissary officer under the command of col edwin v sumner he was promoted to first lieutenant in  also in  stuart met flora cooke the daughter of the commander of the nd us dragoon regiment lieutenant colonel philip st george cooke burke davis described flora as an accomplished horsewoman and though not pretty an effective charmer to whom stuart succumbed with hardly a struggle  they became engaged in september less than two months after meeting stuart humorously wrote of his rapid courtship in latin veni vidi victus sum i came i saw i was conquered although a gala wedding was planned for fort riley kansas the death of stuarts father on september  caused a change of plans and the marriage on november  was small and limited to family witnesses the couple owned two slaves until  one inherited from his fathers estate the other purchased stuarts leadership capabilities were soon recognized he was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with native americans and the antebellum violence of bleeding kansas he was wounded on july   while fighting at solomon river kansas against the cheyenne col sumner ordered a charge with drawn sabers against a wave of indian arrows scattering the warriors stuart and three other lieutenants chased one down whom stuart wounded in the thigh with his pistol the cheyenne turned and fired at stuart with an oldfashioned pistol striking him in the chest with a bullet which did little more damage than to pierce the skin stuart returned in september to fort leavenworth and was reunited with his wife their first child a girl had been born in  but died the same day on november   flora gave birth to another daughter whom the parents named flora after her mother the family relocated in early  to fort riley where they remained for three years in  stuart developed a new piece of cavalry equipment for which he received patent number  on october —a saber hook or an improved method of attaching sabers to belts the us government paid stuart  for a right to use license and stuart contracted with knorr nece and co of philadelphia to manufacture his hook while in washington dc to discuss government contracts and in conjunction with his application for an appointment into the quartermaster department stuart heard about john browns raid on the us arsenal at harpers ferry stuart volunteered to be aidedecamp to col robert e lee and accompanied lee with a company of us marines from the marine barracks th  i washington dc and four companies of maryland militia while delivering lees written surrender ultimatum to the leader of the group who had been calling himself isaac smith stuart recognized old ossawatomie brown from his days in kansas stuart was promoted to captain on april   but resigned from the us army on may   to join the confederate states army following the secession of virginia his letter of resignation sent from cairo illinois was accepted by the war department on may  upon learning that his fatherinlaw col cooke would remain in the us army during the coming war stuart wrote to his brotherinlaw future confederate brig gen john rogers cooke he will regret it but once and that will be continuously  on june   flora gave birth to a son philip st george cooke stuart but his father changed the name to james ewell brown stuart jr jimmie in late  out of disgust with his fatherinlaw confederate armyedit early serviceedit stuart was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel of virginia infantry in the confederate army on may   maj gen robert e lee now commanding the armed forces of virginia ordered him to report to colonel thomas j jackson at harpers ferry jackson chose to ignore stuarts infantry designation and assigned him on july  to command all the cavalry companies of the army of the shenandoah organized as the st virginia cavalry regiment he was promoted to colonel on july  stuart is a rare man wonderfully endowed by nature with the qualities necessary for an officer of light cavalry  calm firm acute active and enterprising i know no one more competent than he to estimate the occurrences before him at their true value if you add to this army a real brigade of cavalry you can find no better brigadiergeneral to command it general joseph e johnston letter to confederate president jefferson davis august  after early service in the shenandoah valley stuart led his regiment in the first battle of bull run and participated in the pursuit of the retreating federals he then commanded the armys outposts along the upper potomac river until given command of the cavalry brigade for the army then known as the army of the potomac later named the army of northern virginia he was promoted to brigadier general on september   peninsulaedit in  the union army of the potomac began its peninsula campaign against richmond virginia and stuarts cavalry brigade assisted gen joseph e johnstons army as it withdrew up the virginia peninsula in the face of superior numbers stuart fought at the battle of williamsburg but in general the terrain and weather on the peninsula did not lend themselves to cavalry operations however when gen robert e lee became commander of the army of northern virginia he requested that stuart perform reconnaissance to determine whether the right flank of the union army was vulnerable stuart set out with  troopers on the morning of june  and having determined that the flank was indeed vulnerable took his men on a complete circumnavigation of the union army returning after  miles on july  with  captured union soldiers  horses and mules and various quartermaster and ordnance supplies his men met no serious opposition from the more decentralized union cavalry coincidentally commanded by his fatherinlaw col cooke the maneuver was a public relations sensation and stuart was greeted with flower petals thrown in his path at richmond he had become as famous as stonewall jackson in the eyes of the confederacy northern virginiaedit confederate cavalry general jeb stuart early in the northern virginia campaign stuart was promoted to major general on july   and his command was upgraded to the cavalry division he was nearly captured and lost his signature plumed hat and cloak to pursuing federals during a raid in august but in a retaliatory raid at catletts station the following day managed to overrun union army commander maj gen john popes headquarters and not only captured popes full uniform but also intercepted orders that provided lee with valuable intelligence concerning reinforcements for popes army at the second battle of bull run second manassas stuarts cavalry followed the massive assault by longstreets infantry against popes army protecting its flank with artillery batteries stuart ordered brig gen beverly robertsons brigade to pursue the federals and in a sharp fight against brig gen john bufords brigade col thomas t munfords nd virginia cavalry was overwhelmed until stuart sent in two more regiments as reinforcements bufords men many of whom were new to combat retreated across lewiss ford and stuarts troopers captured over  of them stuarts men harassed the retreating union columns until the campaign ended at the battle of chantilly marylandedit during the maryland campaign of september  stuarts cavalry screened the armys movement north he bears some responsibility for robert e lees lack of knowledge of the position and celerity of the pursuing army of the potomac under george b mcclellan for a fiveday period stuart rested his men and entertained local civilians at a gala ball at urbana maryland his reports make no reference to intelligence gathering by his scouts or patrols as the union army drew near to lees divided army stuarts men skirmished at various points on the approach to frederick and stuart was not able to keep his brigades concentrated enough to resist the oncoming tide he misjudged the union routes of advance ignorant of the union force threatening turners gap and required assistance from the infantry of maj gen dh hill to defend the south mountain passes in the battle of south mountain his horse artillery bombarded the flank of the union army as it opened its attack in the battle of antietam by midafternoon stonewall jackson ordered stuart to command a turning movement with his cavalry against the union right flank and rear which if successful would be followed up by an infantry attack from the west woods stuart began probing the union lines with more artillery barrages which were answered with murderous counterbattery fire and the cavalry movement intended by jackson was never launched stuart and jackson were an unlikely pair one outgoing the other introverted one flashily uniformed the other plainly dressed one prince rupert and the other cromwell yet stuarts selfconfidence penchant for action deep love of virginia and total abstinence from such vices as alcohol tobacco and pessimism endeared him to jackson  stuart was the only man in the confederacy who could make jackson laugh—and who dared to do so james i robertson jr stonewall jackson three weeks after lees army had withdrawn back to virginia on october –  stuart performed another of his audacious circumnavigations of the army of the potomac his chambersburg raid— miles in under  hours from darkesville west virginia to as far north as mercersburg pennsylvania and chambersburg and around to the east through emmitsburg maryland and south through hyattstown maryland and whites ford to leesburg virginia—once again embarrassing his union opponents and seizing horses and supplies but at the expense of exhausted men and animals without gaining much military advantage jubal early referred to it as the greatest horse stealing expedition that only annoyed the enemy stuart gave his friend jackson a fine new officers tunic trimmed with gold lace commissioned from a richmond tailor which he thought would give jackson more of the appearance of a proper general something to which jackson was notoriously indifferent mcclellan pushed his army slowly south urged by president lincoln to pursue lee crossing the potomac starting on october  as lee began moving to counter this stuart screened longstreets corps and skirmished numerous times in early november against union cavalry and infantry around mountville aldie and upperville on november  stuart received sad news by telegram that his daughter flora had died just before her fifth birthday of typhoid fever on november  fredericksburg and chancellorsvilleedit in the december  battle of fredericksburg stuart and his cavalry—most notably his horse artillery under major john pelham—protected stonewall jacksons flank at hamiltons crossing general lee commended his cavalry which effectually guarded our right annoying the enemy and embarrassing his movements by hanging on his flank and attacking when the opportunity occurred stuart reported to flora the next day that he had been shot through his fur collar but was unhurt after christmas lee ordered stuart to conduct a raid north of the rappahannock river to penetrate the enemys rear ascertain if possible his position  movements  inflict upon him such damage as circumstances will permit with  troopers and a horse artillery battery assigned to the operation stuarts raid reached as far north as four miles south of fairfax court house seizing  prisoners horses mules and supplies tapping telegraph lines his signalmen intercepted messages between union commanders and stuart sent a personal telegram to union quartermaster general montgomery c meigs general meigs will in the future please furnish better mules those you have furnished recently are very inferior on march   stuarts cavalry clashed with a union raiding party at kellys ford the minor victory was marred by the death of major pelham which caused stuart profound grief as he thought of him as close as a younger brother he wrote to a confederate congressman the noble the chivalric the gallant pelham is no more  let the tears of agony we have shed and the gloom of mourning throughout my command bear witness flora was pregnant at the time and stuart told her that if it were a boy he wanted him to be named john pelham stuart virginia pelham stuart was born october  chancellorsville may     confederaterebels   unionfederals at the battle of chancellorsville stuart accompanied stonewall jackson on his famous flanking march of may   and started to pursue the retreating soldiers of the union xi corps when he received word that both jackson and his senior division commander maj gen ap hill had been wounded hill bypassing the next most senior infantry general in the corps brig gen robert e rodes sent a message ordering stuart to take command of the second corps although the delays associated with this change of command effectively ended the flanking attack the night of may  stuart performed credibly as an infantry corps commander the following day launching a strong and wellcoordinated attack against the union right flank at chancellorsville when union troops abandoned hazel grove stuart had the presence of mind to quickly occupy it and bombard the union positions with artillery stuart relinquished his infantry command on may  when hill returned to duty stephen w sears wrote  it is hard to see how jeb stuart in a new command a cavalryman commanding infantry and artillery for the first time could have done a better job the astute porter alexander believed all credit was due altogether i do not think there was a more brilliant thing done in the war than stuarts extricating that command from the extremely critical position in which he found it stonewall jackson died on may  and stuart was once again devastated by the loss of a close friend telling his staff that the death was a national calamity jacksons wife mary anna wrote to stuart on august  thanking him for a note of sympathy i need not assure you of which you already know that your friendship  admiration were cordially reciprocated by him i have frequently heard him speak of genl stuart as one of his warm personal friends  also express admiration for your soldierly qualities brandy stationedit the grand review of june  was surely the proudest day of jeb stuarts thirty years as he led a cavalcade of resplendent staff officers to the reviewing stand trumpeters heralded his coming and women and girls strewed his path with flowers before all of the spectators the assembled cavalry brigade stretched a mile and a half after stuart and his entourage galloped past the line in review the troopers in their turn saluted the reviewing stand in columns of squadrons in performing a second march past the squadrons started off at a trot then spurred to a gallop drawing sabers and breaking into the rebel yell the troopers rush toward the horse artillery drawn up in battery the gunners responded defiantly firing blank charges amidst this tumult of cannon fire and thundering hooves a number of ladies swooned in their escorts arms stephen w sears gettysburg battle of brandy station june   returning to the cavalry for the gettysburg campaign stuart endured the two low points in his career starting with the battle of brandy station the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war by june  two of lees infantry corps were camped in and around culpeper six miles northeast holding the line of the rappahannock river stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers mostly near brandy station screening the confederate army against surprise by the enemy stuart requested a full field review of his troops by gen lee this grand review on june  included nearly  mounted troopers and four batteries of horse artillery charging in simulated battle at inlet station about two miles three km southwest of brandy station lee was not able to attend the review however so it was repeated in his presence on june  although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations despite the lower level of activity some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all stuart was doing was feeding his ego and exhausting the horses lee ordered stuart to cross the rappahannock the next day and raid union forward positions screening the confederate army from observation or interference as it moved north anticipating this imminent offensive action stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around brandy station army of the potomac commander maj gen joseph hooker interpreted stuarts presence around culpeper to be indicative of preparations for a raid on his armys supply lines in reaction he ordered his cavalry commander maj gen alfred pleasonton to take a combined arms force of  cavalrymen and  infantry on a spoiling raid to disperse and destroy the  confederates pleasontons force crossed the rappahannock in two columns on june   the first crossing at beverlys ford brig gen john bufords division catching stuart by surprise waking him and his staff to the sound of gunfire the second crossing at kellys ford surprised stuart again and the confederates found themselves assaulted from front and rear in a spirited melee of mounted combat a series of confusing charges and countercharges swept back and forth across fleetwood hill which had been stuarts headquarters the previous night after ten hours of fighting pleasonton ordered his men to withdraw across the rappahannock if gen stuart is to be the eyes and ears of the army we advise him to see more and be seen less  gen stuart has suffered no little in public estimation by the late enterprises of the enemy richmond enquirer june   although stuart claimed a victory because the confederates held the field brandy station is considered a tactical draw and both sides came up short pleasonton was not able to disable stuarts force at the start of an important campaign and he withdrew before finding the location of lees infantry nearby however the fact that the southern cavalry had not detected the movement of two large columns of union cavalry and that they fell victim to a surprise attack was an embarrassment that prompted serious criticism from fellow generals and the southern press the fight also revealed the increased competency of the union cavalry and foreshadowed the decline of the formerly invincible southern mounted arm stuarts ride in the gettysburg campaignedit further information gettysburg campaign stuarts ride shown with a red dotted line during the gettysburg campaign june  – july   following a series of small cavalry battles in june as lees army began marching north through the shenandoah valley stuart may have had in mind the glory of circumnavigating the enemy army once again desiring to erase the stain on his reputation of the surprise at brandy station general lee gave orders to stuart on june  on how he was to participate in the march north and the exact nature of those orders has been argued by the participants and historians ever since but the essence was that he was instructed to guard the mountain passes with part of his force while the army of northern virginia was still south of the potomac and that he was to cross the river with the remainder of the army and screen the right flank of ewells second corps instead of taking a direct route north near the blue ridge mountains however stuart chose to reach ewells flank by taking his three best brigades those of brig gen wade hampton brig gen fitzhugh lee and col john r chambliss the latter replacing the wounded brig gen whf rooney lee between the union army and washington moving north through rockville to westminster and on into pennsylvania hoping to capture supplies along the way and cause havoc near the enemy capital stuart and his three brigades departed salem depot at  am on june  unfortunately for stuarts plan the union armys movement was underway and his proposed route was blocked by columns of federal infantry forcing him to veer farther to the east than either he or general lee had anticipated this prevented stuart from linking up with ewell as ordered and deprived lee of the use of his prime cavalry force the eyes and ears of the army while advancing into unfamiliar enemy territory stuarts command crossed the potomac river at  am on june  at rockville they captured a wagon train of  brandnew fully loaded wagons and mule teams this wagon train would prove to be a logistical hindrance to stuarts advance but he interpreted lees orders as placing importance on gathering supplies the proximity of the confederate raiders provoked some consternation in the national capital and two union cavalry brigades and an artillery battery were sent to pursue the confederates stuart supposedly said that were it not for his fatigued horses he would have marched down the th street road and took abe  cabinet prisoners in westminster on june  his men clashed briefly with and overwhelmed two companies of union cavalry chasing them a long distance on the baltimore road which stuart claimed caused a great panic in the city of baltimore the head of stuarts column encountered brig gen judson kilpatricks cavalry as it passed through hanover and scattered it on june  the battle of hanover ended after kilpatricks men regrouped and drove the confederates out of town stuarts brigades had been better positioned to guard their captured wagon train than to take advantage of the encounter with kilpatrick after a mile trek in the dark his exhausted men reached dover on the morning of july  as the battle of gettysburg was commencing without them stuart headed next for carlisle hoping to find ewell he lobbed a few shells into town during the early evening of july  and burned the carlisle barracks before withdrawing to the south towards gettysburg he and the bulk of his command reached lee at gettysburg the afternoon of july  he ordered wade hampton to cover the left rear of the confederate battle lines and hampton fought with brig gen george armstrong custer at the battle of hunterstown before joining stuart at gettysburg gettysburg and its aftermath edit when stuart arrived at gettysburg on the afternoon of july —bringing with him the caravan of captured union supply wagons—he received a rare rebuke from lee no one witnessed the private meeting between lee and stuart but reports circulated at headquarters that lees greeting was abrupt and frosty colonel edward porter alexander wrote although lee said only well general you are here at last his manner implied rebuke and it was so understood by stuart on the final day of the battle stuart was ordered to get into the enemys rear and disrupt its line of communications at the same time picketts charge was sent against the union positions on cemetery ridge but his attack on east cavalry field was repulsed by union cavalry under brig gens david gregg and george custer during the retreat from gettysburg stuart devoted his full attention to supporting the armys movement successfully screening against aggressive union cavalry pursuit and escorting thousands of wagons with wounded men and captured supplies over difficult roads and through inclement weather numerous skirmishes and minor battles occurred during the screening and delaying actions of the retreat stuarts men were the final units to cross the potomac river returning to virginia in wretched condition—completely worn out and broken down the failure to crush the federal army in pennsylvania in  in the opinion of almost all of the officers of the army of northern virginia can be expressed in five words—the absence of the cavalry confederate maj gen henry heth the gettysburg campaign was the most controversial of stuarts career he became one of the scapegoats along with james longstreet blamed for lees loss at gettysburg by proponents of the postbellum lost cause movement such as jubal early this was fueled in part by opinions of less partisan writers such as stuarts subordinate thomas l rosser who stated after the war that stuart did on this campaign undoubtedly make the fatal blunder which lost us the battle of gettysburg in general lees report on the campaign he wrote  the absence of the cavalry rendered it impossible to obtain accurate information  by the route stuart pursued the federal army was interposed between his command and our main body preventing any communication with him until his arrival at carlisle the march toward gettysburg was conducted more slowly than it would have been had the movements of the federal army been known one of the most forceful postbellum defenses of stuart was by col john s mosby who had served under him during the campaign and was fiercely loyal to the late general writing he made me all that i was in the war  but for his friendship i would never have been heard of he wrote numerous articles for popular publications and published a book length treatise in  a work that relied on his skills as a lawyer to refute categorically all of the claims laid against stuart modern scholarship remains divided on stuarts culpability edward g longacre argues that lee deliberately gave stuart wide discretion in his orders and had no complaints about stuarts tardy arrival at gettysburg because he established no date by which the cavalry was required to link up with ewell the ½ brigades of cavalry left with the main army were adequate for lee to negotiate enemy territory safely and that his choice not to use these brigades effectively cannot be blamed on stuart edwin b coddington refers to the tragedy of stuart in the gettysburg campaign and judges that when fitzhugh lee raised the question of whether stuart exercised the discretion undoubtedly given to him judiciously the answer is no nevertheless replying to historians who maintain that stuarts absence permitted lee to be surprised at gettysburg coddington points out that the union commander maj gen george meade was just as surprised and the initial advantage lay with lee eric j wittenberg and j david petruzzi have concluded that there was plenty of blame to go around and the fault should be divided between stuart the lack of specificity in lees orders and richard s ewell who might have tried harder to link up with stuart northeast of gettysburg jeffry d wert acknowledges that lee his officers and fighting by the army of the potomac bear the responsibility for the confederate loss at gettysburg but states that stuart failed lee and the army in the reckoning at gettysburg  lee trusted him and gave him discretion but stuart acted injudiciously although stuart was not reprimanded or disciplined in any official way for his role in the gettysburg campaign it is noteworthy that his appointment to corps command on september   did not carry with it a promotion to lieutenant general edward bonekemper wrote that since all other corps commanders in the army of northern virginia carried this rank lees decision to keep stuart at major general rank while at the same time promoting stuarts subordinates wade hampton and fitzhugh lee to major generals could be considered an implied rebuke jeffry d wert wrote that there is no evidence lee considered stuarts performance during the gettysburg campaign and that it is more likely that lee thought the responsibilities in command of a cavalry corps did not equal those of an infantry corps fall  and the  overland campaignedit the cavalrys success in the bristoe campaign can be attributed to the generalship boldness and untiring energy of majorgeneral stuart for it was he who directed every movement of importance and his generalship boldness and energy won the unbounded confidence of officers and men and gave the prestige of success confederate colonel oliver funsten bristoe campaign the  overland campaign including the battle of yellow tavern lee reorganized his cavalry on september  creating a cavalry corps for stuart with two divisions of three brigades each in the bristoe campaign stuart was assigned to lead a broad turning movement in an attempt to get into the enemys rear but general meade skillfully withdrew his army without leaving stuart any opportunities to take advantage of on october  stuart blundered into the rear guard of the union iii corps near warrenton ewells corps was sent to rescue him but stuart hid his troopers in a wooded ravine until the unsuspecting iii corps moved on and the assistance was not necessary as meade withdrew towards manassas junction brigades from the union ii corps fought a rearguard action against stuarts cavalry and the infantry of brig gen harry hayss division near auburn on october  stuarts cavalry boldly bluffed warrens infantry and escaped disaster after the confederate repulse at bristoe station and an aborted advance on centreville stuarts cavalry shielded the withdrawal of lees army from the vicinity of manassas junction judson kilpatricks union cavalry pursued stuarts cavalry along the warrenton turnpike but were lured into an ambush near chestnut hill and routed the federal troopers were scattered and chased five miles eight km in an affair that came to be known as the buckland races the southern press began to mute its criticism of stuart following his successful performance during the fall campaign the overland campaign lt gen ulysses s grants offensive against lee in the spring of  began at the battle of the wilderness where stuart aggressively pushed thomas l rossers laurel brigade into a fight against george custers betterarmed michigan brigade resulting in significant losses general lee sent a message to stuart it is very important to save your cavalry  not wear it out  you must use your good judgment to make any attack which may offer advantages as the armies maneuvered toward their next confrontation at spotsylvania court house stuarts cavalry fought delaying actions against the union cavalry his defense at laurel

command and whip it meade reported the comments to grant who replied did sheridan say that well he generally knows what he is talking about let him start right out and do it sheridan immediately organized a raid against confederate supply and railroad lines close to richmond which he knew would bring stuart to battle sheridan moved aggressively to the southeast crossing the north anna river and seizing beaver dam station on the virginia central railroad where his men captured a train liberating  union prisoners and destroying more than one million rations and medical supplies destined for lees army stuart dispatched a force of about  cavalrymen to intercept sheridans cavalry which was more than three times their numbers as he rode in pursuit accompanied by his aide maj andrew r venable they were able to stop briefly along the way to be greeted by stuarts wife flora and his children jimmie and virginia venable wrote of stuart he told me he never expected to live through the war and that if we were conquered that he did not want to live the battle of yellow tavern occurred may  at an abandoned inn located six miles  km north of richmond the confederate troopers

meeting stuart humorously wrote of his rapid courtship in latin veni vidi victus sum i came i saw i was conquered although a gala wedding was planned for fort riley kansas the death of stuarts father

lieutenant colonel of virginia infantry in the confederate army on may   maj gen robert e lee now commanding the armed forces of virginia ordered him to report to colonel thomas j jackson at harpers ferry jackson chose to ignore stuarts infantry designation and assigned him on july  to command all the cavalry companies of the army of the shenandoah organized as the st virginia cavalry regiment he was promoted to colonel on july  stuart is a rare man wonderfully endowed by nature with the qualities necessary for an officer of light cavalry  calm firm acute active and enterprising i know no one more competent than he to estimate the occurrences before him at their true value if you add to this army a real brigade of cavalry you can find no better brigadiergeneral to command it general joseph e johnston letter to confederate president jefferson davis august  after early service in the shenandoah valley stuart led his regiment in the first battle of bull run and participated in the pursuit of the retreating federals he then commanded the armys outposts along the upper potomac river until given command of the cavalry brigade for the army then known as the army of the potomac later named the army of northern virginia he was promoted to brigadier general on september   peninsulaedit in  the union army of the potomac began its peninsula campaign against richmond virginia and stuarts cavalry brigade assisted gen joseph e johnstons army as it withdrew up the virginia peninsula in the face of superior numbers stuart fought at the battle of williamsburg but in general the terrain and weather on the peninsula did not lend themselves to cavalry operations however when gen robert e lee became commander of the army of northern virginia he requested that stuart perform reconnaissance to determine whether the right flank of the union army was vulnerable stuart set out with  troopers on the morning of june  and having determined that the flank was indeed vulnerable took his men on a complete circumnavigation of the union army returning after  miles on july  with  captured union soldiers  horses and mules and various quartermaster and ordnance supplies his men met no serious opposition from the more decentralized union cavalry coincidentally commanded by his fatherinlaw col cooke the maneuver was a public relations sensation and stuart was greeted with flower petals thrown in his path at richmond he had become as famous as stonewall jackson in the eyes of the confederacy northern virginiaedit confederate cavalry general jeb stuart early in the northern virginia campaign stuart was promoted to major general on july   and his command was upgraded to the cavalry division he was nearly captured and lost his signature plumed hat and cloak to pursuing federals during a raid in august but in a retaliatory raid at catletts station the following day managed to overrun union army commander maj gen john popes headquarters and not only captured popes full uniform but also intercepted orders that provided lee with valuable intelligence concerning reinforcements for popes army at the second battle of bull run second manassas stuarts cavalry followed the massive assault by longstreets infantry against popes army protecting its flank with artillery batteries stuart ordered brig gen beverly robertsons brigade to pursue the federals and in a sharp fight against brig gen john bufords brigade col thomas t munfords nd virginia cavalry was overwhelmed until stuart sent in two more regiments as reinforcements bufords men many of whom were new to combat retreated across lewiss ford and stuarts troopers captured over  of them stuarts men harassed the retreating union columns until the campaign ended at the battle of chantilly marylandedit during the maryland campaign of september  stuarts cavalry screened the armys movement north he bears some responsibility for robert e lees lack of knowledge of the position and celerity of the pursuing army of the potomac under george b mcclellan for a fiveday period stuart rested his men and entertained local civilians at a gala ball at urbana maryland his reports make no reference to intelligence gathering by his scouts or patrols as the union army drew near to lees divided army stuarts men skirmished at various points on the approach to frederick and stuart was not able to keep his brigades concentrated enough to resist the oncoming tide he misjudged the union routes of advance ignorant of the union force threatening turners gap and required assistance from the infantry of maj gen dh hill to defend the south mountain passes in the battle of south mountain his horse artillery bombarded the flank of the union army as it opened its attack in the battle of antietam by midafternoon stonewall jackson ordered stuart to command a turning movement with his cavalry against the union right flank and rear which if successful would be followed up by an infantry attack from the west woods stuart began probing the union lines with more artillery barrages which were answered with murderous counterbattery fire and the cavalry movement intended by jackson was never launched stuart and jackson were an unlikely pair one outgoing the other introverted one flashily uniformed the other plainly dressed one prince rupert and the other cromwell yet stuarts selfconfidence penchant for action deep love of virginia and total abstinence from such vices as alcohol tobacco and pessimism endeared him to jackson  stuart was the only man in the confederacy who could make jackson laugh—and who dared to do so james i robertson jr stonewall jackson three weeks after lees army had withdrawn back to virginia on october –  stuart performed another of his audacious circumnavigations of the army of the potomac his chambersburg raid— miles in under  hours from darkesville west virginia to as far north as mercersburg pennsylvania and chambersburg and around to the east through emmitsburg maryland and south through hyattstown maryland and whites ford to leesburg virginia—once again embarrassing his union opponents and seizing horses and supplies but at the expense of exhausted men and animals without gaining much military advantage jubal early referred to it as the greatest horse stealing expedition that only annoyed the enemy stuart gave his friend jackson a fine new officers tunic trimmed with gold lace commissioned from a richmond tailor which he thought would give jackson more of the appearance of a proper general something to which jackson was notoriously indifferent mcclellan pushed his army slowly south urged by president lincoln to pursue lee crossing the potomac starting on october  as lee began moving to counter this stuart screened longstreets corps and skirmished numerous times in early november against union cavalry and infantry around mountville aldie and upperville on november  stuart received sad news by telegram that his daughter flora had died just before her fifth birthday of typhoid fever on november  fredericksburg and chancellorsvilleedit in the december  battle of fredericksburg stuart and his cavalry—most notably his horse artillery under major john pelham—protected stonewall jacksons flank at hamiltons crossing general lee commended his cavalry which effectually guarded our right annoying the enemy and embarrassing his movements by hanging on his flank and attacking when the opportunity occurred stuart reported to flora the next day that he had been shot through his fur collar but was unhurt after christmas lee ordered stuart to conduct a raid north of the rappahannock river to penetrate the enemys rear ascertain if possible his position  movements  inflict upon him such damage as circumstances will permit with  troopers and a horse artillery battery assigned to the operation stuarts raid reached as far north as four miles south of fairfax court house seizing  prisoners horses mules and supplies tapping telegraph lines his signalmen intercepted messages between union commanders and stuart sent a personal telegram to union quartermaster general montgomery c meigs general meigs will in the future please furnish better mules those you have furnished recently are very inferior on march   stuarts cavalry clashed with a union raiding party at kellys ford the minor victory was marred by the death of major pelham which caused stuart profound grief as he thought of him as close as a younger brother he wrote to a confederate congressman the noble the chivalric the gallant pelham is no more  let the tears of agony we have shed and the gloom of mourning throughout my command bear witness flora was pregnant at the time and stuart told her that if it were a boy he wanted him to be named john pelham stuart virginia pelham stuart was born october  chancellorsville may     confederaterebels   unionfederals at the battle of chancellorsville stuart accompanied stonewall jackson on his famous flanking march of may   and started to pursue the retreating soldiers of the union xi corps when he received word that both jackson and his senior division commander maj gen ap hill had been wounded hill bypassing the next most senior infantry general in the corps brig gen robert e rodes sent a message ordering stuart to take command of the second corps although the delays associated with this change of command effectively ended the flanking attack the night of may  stuart performed credibly as an infantry corps commander the following day launching a strong and wellcoordinated attack against the union right flank at chancellorsville when union troops abandoned hazel grove stuart had the presence of mind to quickly occupy it and bombard the union positions with artillery stuart relinquished his infantry command on may  when hill returned to duty stephen w sears wrote  it is hard to see how jeb stuart in a new command a cavalryman commanding infantry and artillery for the first time could have done a better job the astute porter alexander believed all credit was due altogether i do not think there was a more brilliant thing done in the war than stuarts extricating that command from the extremely critical position in which he found it stonewall jackson died on may  and stuart was once again devastated by the loss of a close friend telling his staff that the death was a national calamity jacksons wife mary anna wrote to stuart on august  thanking him for a note of sympathy i need not assure you of which you already know that your friendship  admiration were cordially reciprocated by him i have frequently heard him speak of genl stuart as one of his warm personal friends  also express admiration for your soldierly qualities brandy stationedit the grand review of june  was surely the proudest day of jeb stuarts thirty years as he led a cavalcade of resplendent staff officers to the reviewing stand trumpeters heralded his coming and women and girls strewed his path with flowers before all of the spectators the assembled cavalry brigade stretched a mile and a half after stuart and his entourage galloped past the line in review the troopers in their turn saluted the reviewing stand in columns of squadrons in performing a second march past the squadrons started off at a trot then spurred to a gallop drawing sabers and breaking into the rebel yell the troopers rush toward the horse artillery drawn up in battery the gunners responded defiantly firing blank charges amidst this tumult of cannon fire and thundering hooves a number of ladies swooned in their escorts arms stephen w sears gettysburg battle of brandy station june   returning to the cavalry for the gettysburg campaign stuart endured the two low points in his career starting with the battle of brandy station the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war by june  two of lees infantry corps were camped in and around culpeper six miles northeast holding the line of the rappahannock river stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers mostly near brandy station screening the confederate army against surprise by the enemy stuart requested a full field review of his troops by gen lee this grand review on june  included nearly  mounted troopers and four batteries of horse artillery charging in simulated battle at inlet station about two miles three km southwest of brandy station lee was not able to attend the review however so it was repeated in his presence on june  although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations despite the lower level of activity some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all stuart was doing was feeding his ego and exhausting the horses lee ordered stuart to cross the rappahannock the next day and raid union forward positions screening the confederate army from observation or interference as it moved north anticipating this imminent offensive action stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around brandy station army of the potomac commander maj gen joseph hooker interpreted stuarts presence around culpeper to be indicative of preparations for a raid on his armys supply lines in reaction he ordered his cavalry commander maj gen alfred pleasonton to take a combined arms force of  cavalrymen and  infantry on a spoiling raid to disperse and destroy the  confederates pleasontons force crossed the rappahannock in two columns on june   the first crossing at beverlys ford brig gen john bufords division catching stuart by surprise waking him and his staff to the sound of gunfire the second crossing at kellys ford surprised stuart again and the confederates found themselves assaulted from front and rear in a spirited melee of mounted combat a series of confusing charges and countercharges swept back and forth across fleetwood hill which had been stuarts headquarters the previous night after ten hours of fighting pleasonton ordered his men to withdraw across the rappahannock if gen stuart is to be the eyes and ears of the army we advise him to see more and be seen less  gen stuart has suffered no little in public estimation by the late enterprises of the enemy richmond enquirer june   although stuart claimed a victory because the confederates held the field brandy station is considered a tactical draw and both sides came up short pleasonton was not able to disable stuarts force at the start of an important campaign and he withdrew before finding the location of lees infantry nearby however the fact that the southern cavalry had not detected the movement of two large columns of union cavalry and that they fell victim to a surprise attack was an embarrassment that prompted serious criticism from fellow generals and the southern press the fight also revealed the increased competency of the union cavalry and foreshadowed the decline of the formerly invincible southern mounted arm stuarts ride in the gettysburg campaignedit further information gettysburg campaign stuarts ride shown with a red dotted line during the gettysburg campaign june  – july   following a series of small cavalry battles in june as lees army began marching north through the shenandoah valley stuart may have had in mind the glory of circumnavigating the enemy army once again desiring to erase the stain on his reputation of the surprise at brandy station general lee gave orders to stuart on june  on how he was to participate in the march north and the exact nature of those orders has been argued by the participants and historians ever since but the essence was that he was instructed to guard the mountain passes with part of his force while the army of northern virginia was still south of the potomac and that he was to cross the river with the remainder of the army and screen the right flank of ewells second corps instead of taking a direct route north near the blue ridge mountains however stuart chose to reach ewells flank by taking his three best brigades those of brig gen wade hampton brig gen fitzhugh lee and col john r chambliss the latter replacing the wounded brig gen whf rooney lee between the union army and washington moving north through rockville to westminster and on into pennsylvania hoping to capture supplies along the way and cause havoc near the enemy capital stuart and his three brigades departed salem depot at  am on june  unfortunately for stuarts plan the union armys movement was underway and his proposed route was blocked by columns of federal infantry forcing him to veer farther to the east than either he or general lee had anticipated this prevented stuart from linking up with ewell as ordered and deprived lee of the use of his prime cavalry force the eyes and ears of the army while advancing into unfamiliar enemy territory stuarts command crossed the potomac river at  am on june  at rockville they captured a wagon train of  brandnew fully loaded wagons and mule teams this wagon train would prove to be a logistical hindrance to stuarts advance but he interpreted lees orders as placing importance on gathering supplies the proximity of the confederate raiders provoked some consternation in the national capital and two union cavalry brigades and an artillery battery were sent to pursue the confederates stuart supposedly said that were it not for his fatigued horses he would have marched down the th street road and took abe  cabinet prisoners in westminster on june  his men clashed briefly with and overwhelmed two companies of union cavalry chasing them a long distance on the baltimore road which stuart claimed caused a great panic in the city of baltimore the head of stuarts column encountered brig gen judson kilpatricks cavalry as it passed through hanover and scattered it on june  the battle of hanover ended after kilpatricks men regrouped and drove the confederates out of town stuarts brigades had been better positioned to guard their captured wagon train than to take advantage of the encounter with kilpatrick after a mile trek in the dark his exhausted men reached dover on the morning of july  as the battle of gettysburg was commencing without them stuart headed next for carlisle hoping to find ewell he lobbed a few shells into town during the early evening of july  and burned the carlisle barracks before withdrawing to the south towards gettysburg he and the bulk of his command reached lee at gettysburg the afternoon of july  he ordered wade hampton to cover the left rear of the confederate battle lines and hampton fought with brig gen george armstrong custer at the battle of hunterstown before joining stuart at gettysburg gettysburg and its aftermath edit when stuart arrived at gettysburg on the afternoon of july —bringing with him the caravan of captured union supply wagons—he received a rare rebuke from lee no one witnessed the private meeting between lee and stuart but reports circulated at headquarters that lees greeting was abrupt and frosty colonel edward porter alexander wrote although lee said only well general you are here at last his manner implied rebuke and it was so understood by stuart on the final day of the battle stuart was ordered to get into the enemys rear and disrupt its line of communications at the same time picketts charge was sent against the union positions on cemetery ridge but his attack on east cavalry field was repulsed by union cavalry under brig gens david gregg and george custer during the retreat from gettysburg stuart devoted his full attention to supporting the armys movement successfully screening against aggressive union cavalry pursuit and escorting thousands of wagons with wounded men and captured supplies over difficult roads and through inclement weather numerous skirmishes and minor battles occurred during the screening and delaying actions of the retreat stuarts men were the final units to cross the potomac river returning to virginia in wretched condition—completely worn out and broken down the failure to crush the federal army in pennsylvania in  in the opinion of almost all of the officers of the army of northern virginia can be expressed in five words—the absence of the cavalry confederate maj gen henry heth the gettysburg campaign was the most controversial of stuarts career he became one of the scapegoats along with james longstreet blamed for lees loss at gettysburg by proponents of the postbellum lost cause movement such as jubal early this was fueled in part by opinions of less partisan writers such as stuarts subordinate thomas l rosser who stated after the war that stuart did on this campaign undoubtedly make the fatal blunder which lost us the battle of gettysburg in general lees report on the campaign he wrote  the absence of the cavalry rendered it impossible to obtain accurate information  by the route stuart pursued the federal army was interposed between his command and our main body preventing any communication with him until his arrival at carlisle the march toward gettysburg was conducted more slowly than it would have been had the movements of the federal army been known one of the most forceful postbellum defenses of stuart was by col john s mosby who had served under him during the campaign and was fiercely loyal to the late general writing he made me all that i was in the war  but for his friendship i would never have been heard of he wrote numerous articles for popular publications and published a book length treatise in  a work that relied on his skills as a lawyer to refute categorically all of the claims laid against stuart modern scholarship remains divided on stuarts culpability edward g longacre argues that lee deliberately gave stuart wide discretion in his orders and had no complaints about stuarts tardy arrival at gettysburg because he established no date by which the cavalry was required to link up with ewell the ½ brigades of cavalry left with the main army were adequate for lee to negotiate enemy territory safely and that his choice not to use these brigades effectively cannot be blamed on stuart edwin b coddington refers to the tragedy of stuart in the gettysburg campaign and judges that when fitzhugh lee raised the question of whether stuart exercised the discretion undoubtedly given to him judiciously the answer is no nevertheless replying to historians who maintain that stuarts absence permitted lee to be surprised at gettysburg coddington points out that the union commander maj gen george meade was just as surprised and the initial advantage lay with lee eric j wittenberg and j david petruzzi have concluded that there was plenty of blame to go around and the fault should be divided between stuart the lack of specificity in lees orders and richard s ewell who might have tried harder to link up with stuart northeast of gettysburg jeffry d wert acknowledges that lee his officers and fighting by the army of the potomac bear the responsibility for the confederate loss at gettysburg but states that stuart failed lee and the army in the reckoning at gettysburg  lee trusted him and gave him discretion but stuart acted injudiciously although stuart was not reprimanded or disciplined in any official way for his role in the gettysburg campaign it is noteworthy that his appointment to corps command on september   did not carry with it a promotion to lieutenant general edward bonekemper wrote that since all other corps commanders in the army of northern virginia carried this rank lees decision to keep stuart at major general rank while at the same time promoting stuarts subordinates wade hampton and fitzhugh lee to major generals could be considered an implied rebuke jeffry d wert wrote that there is no evidence lee considered stuarts performance during the gettysburg campaign and that it is more likely that lee thought the responsibilities in command of a cavalry corps did not equal those of an infantry corps fall  and the  overland campaignedit the cavalrys success in the bristoe campaign can be attributed to the generalship boldness and untiring energy of majorgeneral stuart for it was he who directed every movement of importance and his generalship boldness and energy won the unbounded confidence of officers and men and gave the prestige of success confederate colonel oliver funsten bristoe campaign the  overland campaign including the battle of yellow tavern lee reorganized his cavalry on september  creating a cavalry corps for stuart with two divisions of three brigades each in the bristoe campaign stuart was assigned to lead a broad turning movement in an attempt to get into the enemys rear but general meade skillfully withdrew his army without leaving stuart any opportunities to take advantage of on october  stuart blundered into the rear guard of the union iii corps near warrenton ewells corps was sent to rescue him but stuart hid his troopers in a wooded ravine until the unsuspecting iii corps moved on and the assistance was not necessary as meade withdrew towards manassas junction brigades from the union ii corps fought a rearguard action against stuarts cavalry and the infantry of brig gen harry hayss division near auburn on october  stuarts cavalry boldly bluffed warrens infantry and escaped disaster after the confederate repulse at bristoe station and an aborted advance on centreville stuarts cavalry shielded the withdrawal of lees army from the vicinity of manassas junction judson kilpatricks union cavalry pursued stuarts cavalry along the warrenton turnpike but were lured into an ambush near chestnut hill and routed the federal troopers were scattered and chased five miles eight km in an affair that came to be known as the buckland races the southern press began to mute its criticism of stuart following his successful performance during the fall campaign the overland campaign lt gen ulysses s grants offensive against lee in the spring of  began at the battle of the wilderness where stuart aggressively pushed thomas l rossers laurel brigade into a fight against george custers betterarmed michigan brigade resulting in significant losses general lee sent a message to stuart it is very important to save your cavalry  not wear it out  you must use your good judgment to make any attack which may offer advantages as the armies maneuvered toward their next confrontation at spotsylvania court house stuarts cavalry fought delaying actions against the union cavalry his defense at laurel

command and whip it meade reported the comments to grant who replied did sheridan say that well he generally knows what he is talking about let him start right out and do it sheridan immediately organized a raid against confederate supply and railroad lines close to richmond which he knew would bring stuart to battle sheridan moved aggressively to the southeast crossing the north anna river and seizing beaver dam station on the virginia central railroad where his men captured a train liberating  union prisoners and destroying more than one million rations and medical supplies destined for lees army stuart dispatched a force of about  cavalrymen to intercept sheridans cavalry which was more than three times their numbers as he rode in pursuit accompanied by his aide maj andrew r

officer from the us state of virginia who later became a confederate states army general during the american civil war he was known to his friends as jeb from the initials of his given names stuart was a cavalry commander known for his mastery of reconnaissance and the use of cavalry in support of offensive operations while he cultivated a cavalier image redlined gray cape yellow sash hat cocked to the side with an ostrich plume red flower in his lapel often sporting cologne his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of robert e lees army and inspired southern morale stuart graduated from west point in  and served in texas and kansas with the us army he was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with native americans and the violence of bleeding kansas and he participated in the capture of john brown at harpers ferry he resigned when his home state of virginia seceded to serve in the confederate army first under stonewall jackson in the shenandoah valley but then in increasingly important cavalry commands of the army of northern virginia playing a role in all of that armys campaigns until his death he established a reputation as an audacious cavalry commander and on two occasions during the peninsula campaign and the maryland campaign circumnavigated the union army of the potomac bringing fame to himself and embarrassment to the north at the battle of chancellorsville he distinguished himself as a temporary commander of the wounded stonewall jacksons infantry corps arguably stuarts most famous campaign gettysburg was marred when he was surprised by a union cavalry attack at the battle of brandy station and by his separation from lees army for an extended period leaving lee unaware of union troop movements and contributing to the confederate defeat at the battle of gettysburg stuart received significant criticism from the southern press as well as the postbellum proponents of the lost cause movement but historians have failed to agree on whether stuarts exploit was entirely the fault of his judgment or simply a result of bad luck and lees lessthanexplicit orders during the  overland campaign union maj gen philip sheridans cavalry

was rejected as underaged he obtained an appointment in  to the united states military academy at west point new york from representative thomas hamlet averett the man who had defeated his father in the  election stuart was a popular student and was happy at the academy although not handsome in his teen years his classmates called him by the nickname beauty which they described as his personal comeliness in inverse ratio to the term employed he possessed a chin so short and retiring as positively to disfigure his otherwise fine countenance he quickly grew a beard after graduation and a fellow officer remarked that he was the only man he ever saw that a beard improved robert e lee was appointed superintendent of the academy in  and stuart became a friend of the lee family seeing them socially on frequent occasions lees nephew fitzhugh lee also arrived at the academy in  in stuarts final year in addition to achieving the cadet rank of second captain of the corps he was one of eight cadets designated as honorary cavalry officers for his skills in horsemanship stuart graduated th in his class of  in  he ranked tenth in his class in cavalry tactics although he enjoyed the civil engineering curriculum at the academy and did well in mathematics his poor drawing skills hampered his engineering studies and he finished th in that discipline a stuart family tradition says he deliberately degraded his academic performance in his final year to avoid service in the elite but dull corps of engineers united states armyedit stuart was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant and assigned to the us regiment of mounted riflemen in texas after an arduous journey he reached fort davis on january   and was a leader for three months on scouting missions over the san antonio to el paso road he was soon transferred to the newly formed st cavalry regiment  at fort leavenworth kansas territory where he became regimental quartermaster and commissary officer under the command of col edwin v sumner he was promoted to first lieutenant in  also in  stuart met flora cooke the daughter of the commander of the nd us dragoon regiment lieutenant colonel philip st george cooke burke davis described flora as an accomplished horsewoman and though not pretty an effective charmer to whom stuart succumbed with hardly a struggle  they became engaged in september less than two months after meeting stuart humorously wrote of his rapid courtship in latin veni vidi victus sum i came i saw i was conquered although a gala wedding was planned for fort riley kansas the death of stuarts father on september  caused a change of plans and the marriage on november  was small and limited to family witnesses the couple owned two slaves until  one inherited from his fathers estate the other purchased stuarts leadership capabilities were soon recognized he was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with native americans and the antebellum violence of bleeding kansas he was wounded on july   while fighting at solomon river kansas against the cheyenne col sumner ordered a charge with drawn sabers against a wave of indian arrows scattering the warriors stuart and three other lieutenants chased one down whom stuart wounded in the thigh with his pistol the cheyenne turned and fired at stuart with an oldfashioned pistol striking him in the chest with a bullet which did little more damage than to pierce the skin stuart returned in september to fort leavenworth and was reunited with his wife their first child a girl had been born in  but died the same day on november   flora gave birth to another daughter whom the parents named flora after her mother the family relocated in early  to fort riley where they remained for three years in  stuart developed a new piece of cavalry equipment for which he received patent number  on october —a saber hook or an improved method of attaching sabers to belts the us government paid stuart  for a right to use license and stuart contracted with knorr nece and co of philadelphia to manufacture his hook while in washington dc to discuss government contracts and in conjunction with his application for an appointment into the quartermaster department stuart heard about john browns raid on the us arsenal at harpers ferry stuart volunteered to be aidedecamp to col robert e lee and accompanied lee with a company of us marines from the marine barracks th  i washington dc and four companies of maryland militia while delivering lees written surrender ultimatum to the leader of the group who had been calling himself isaac smith stuart recognized old ossawatomie brown from his days in kansas stuart was promoted to captain on april   but resigned from the us army on may   to join the confederate states army following the secession of virginia his letter of resignation sent from cairo illinois was accepted by the war department on may  upon learning that his fatherinlaw col cooke would remain in the us army during the coming war stuart wrote to his brotherinlaw future confederate brig gen john rogers cooke he will regret it but once and that will be continuously  on june   flora gave birth to a son philip st george cooke stuart but his father changed the name to james ewell brown stuart jr jimmie in late  out of disgust with his fatherinlaw confederate armyedit early serviceedit stuart was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel of virginia infantry in the confederate army on may   maj gen robert e lee now commanding the armed forces of virginia ordered him to report to colonel thomas j jackson at harpers ferry jackson chose to ignore stuarts infantry designation and assigned him on july  to command all the cavalry companies of the army of the shenandoah organized as the st virginia cavalry regiment he was promoted to colonel on july  stuart is a rare man wonderfully endowed by nature with the qualities necessary for an officer of light cavalry  calm firm acute active and enterprising i know no one more competent than he to estimate the occurrences before him at their true value if you add to this army a real brigade of cavalry you can find no better brigadiergeneral to command it general joseph e johnston letter to confederate president jefferson davis august  after early service in the shenandoah valley stuart led his regiment in the first battle of bull run and participated in the pursuit of the retreating federals he then commanded the armys outposts along the upper potomac river until given command of the cavalry brigade for the army then known as the army of the potomac later named the army of northern virginia he was promoted to brigadier general on september   peninsulaedit in  the union army of the potomac began its peninsula campaign against richmond virginia and stuarts cavalry brigade assisted gen joseph e johnstons army as it withdrew up the virginia peninsula in the face of superior numbers stuart fought at the battle of williamsburg but in general the terrain and weather on the peninsula did not lend themselves to cavalry operations however when gen robert e lee became commander of the army of northern virginia he requested that stuart perform reconnaissance to determine whether the right flank of the union army was vulnerable stuart set out with  troopers on the morning of june  and having determined that the flank was indeed vulnerable took his men on a complete circumnavigation of the union army returning after  miles on july  with  captured union soldiers  horses and mules and various quartermaster and ordnance supplies his men met no serious opposition from the more decentralized union cavalry coincidentally commanded by his fatherinlaw col cooke the maneuver was a public relations sensation and stuart was greeted with flower petals thrown in his path at richmond he had become as famous as stonewall jackson in the eyes of the confederacy northern virginiaedit confederate cavalry general jeb stuart early in the northern virginia campaign stuart was promoted to major general on july   and his command was upgraded to the cavalry division he was nearly captured and lost his signature plumed hat and cloak to pursuing federals during a raid in august but in a retaliatory raid at catletts station the following day managed to overrun union army commander maj gen john popes headquarters and not only captured popes full uniform but also intercepted orders that provided lee with valuable intelligence concerning reinforcements for popes army at the second battle of bull run second manassas stuarts cavalry followed the massive assault by longstreets infantry against popes army protecting its flank with artillery batteries stuart ordered brig gen beverly robertsons brigade to pursue the federals and in a sharp fight against brig gen john bufords brigade col thomas t munfords nd virginia cavalry was overwhelmed until stuart sent in two more regiments as reinforcements bufords men many of whom were new to combat retreated across lewiss ford and stuarts troopers captured over  of them stuarts men harassed the retreating union columns until the campaign ended at the battle of chantilly marylandedit during the maryland campaign of september  stuarts cavalry screened the armys movement north he bears some responsibility for robert e lees lack of knowledge of the position and celerity of the pursuing army of the potomac under george b mcclellan for a fiveday period stuart rested his men and entertained local civilians at a gala ball at urbana maryland his reports make no reference to intelligence gathering by his scouts or patrols as the union army drew near to lees divided army stuarts men skirmished at various points on the approach to frederick and stuart was not able to keep his brigades concentrated enough to resist the oncoming tide he misjudged the union routes of advance ignorant of the union force threatening turners gap and required assistance from the infantry of maj gen dh hill to defend the south mountain passes in the battle of south mountain his horse artillery bombarded the flank of the union army as it opened its attack in the battle of antietam by midafternoon stonewall jackson ordered stuart to command a turning movement with his cavalry against the union right flank and rear which if successful would be followed up by an infantry attack from the west woods stuart began probing the union lines with more artillery barrages which were answered with murderous counterbattery fire and the cavalry movement intended by jackson was never launched stuart and jackson were an unlikely pair one outgoing the other introverted one flashily uniformed the other plainly dressed one prince rupert and the other cromwell yet stuarts selfconfidence penchant for action deep love of virginia and total abstinence from such vices as alcohol tobacco and pessimism endeared him to jackson  stuart was the only man in the confederacy who could make jackson laugh—and who dared to do so james i robertson jr stonewall jackson three weeks after lees army had withdrawn back to virginia on october –  stuart performed another of his audacious circumnavigations of the army of the potomac his chambersburg raid— miles in under  hours from darkesville west virginia to as far north as mercersburg pennsylvania and chambersburg and around to the east through emmitsburg maryland and south through hyattstown maryland and whites ford to leesburg virginia—once again embarrassing his union opponents and seizing horses and supplies but at the expense of exhausted men and animals without gaining much military advantage jubal early referred to it as the greatest horse stealing expedition that only annoyed the enemy stuart gave his friend jackson a fine new officers tunic trimmed with gold lace commissioned from a richmond tailor which he thought would give jackson more of the appearance of a proper general something to which jackson was notoriously indifferent mcclellan pushed his army slowly south urged by president lincoln to pursue lee crossing the potomac starting on october  as lee began moving to counter this stuart screened longstreets corps and skirmished numerous times in early november against union cavalry and infantry around mountville aldie and upperville on november  stuart received sad news by telegram that his daughter flora had died just before her fifth birthday of typhoid fever on november  fredericksburg and chancellorsvilleedit in the december  battle of fredericksburg stuart and his cavalry—most notably his horse artillery under major john pelham—protected stonewall jacksons flank at hamiltons crossing general lee commended his cavalry which effectually guarded our right annoying the enemy and embarrassing his movements by hanging on his flank and attacking when the opportunity occurred stuart reported to flora the next day that he had been shot through his fur collar but was unhurt after christmas lee ordered stuart to conduct a raid north of the rappahannock river to penetrate the enemys rear ascertain if possible his position  movements  inflict upon him such damage as circumstances will permit with  troopers and a horse artillery battery assigned to the operation stuarts raid reached as far north as four miles south of fairfax court house seizing  prisoners horses mules and supplies tapping telegraph lines his signalmen intercepted messages between union commanders and stuart sent a personal telegram to union quartermaster general montgomery c meigs general meigs will in the future please furnish better mules those you have furnished recently are very inferior on march   stuarts cavalry clashed with a union raiding party at kellys ford the minor victory was marred by the death of major pelham which caused stuart profound grief as he thought of him as close as a younger brother he wrote to a confederate congressman the noble the chivalric the gallant pelham is no more  let the tears of agony we have shed and the gloom of mourning throughout my command bear witness flora was pregnant at the time and stuart told her that if it were a boy he wanted him to be named john pelham stuart virginia pelham stuart was born october  chancellorsville may     confederaterebels   unionfederals at the battle of chancellorsville stuart accompanied stonewall jackson on his famous flanking march of may   and started to pursue the retreating soldiers of the union xi corps when he received word that both jackson and his senior division commander maj gen ap hill had been wounded hill bypassing the next most senior infantry general in the corps brig gen robert e rodes sent a message ordering stuart to take command of the second corps although the delays associated with this change of command effectively ended the flanking attack the night of may  stuart performed credibly as an infantry corps commander the following day launching a strong and wellcoordinated attack against the union right flank at chancellorsville when union troops abandoned hazel grove stuart had the presence of mind to quickly occupy it and bombard the union positions with artillery stuart relinquished his infantry command on may  when hill returned to duty stephen w sears wrote  it is hard to see how jeb stuart in a new command a cavalryman commanding infantry and artillery for the first time could have done a better job the astute porter alexander believed all credit was due altogether i do not think there was a more brilliant thing done in the war than stuarts extricating that command from the extremely critical position in which he found it stonewall jackson died on may  and stuart was once again devastated by the loss of a close friend telling his staff that the death was a national calamity jacksons wife mary anna wrote to stuart on august  thanking him for a note of sympathy i need not assure you of which you already know that your friendship  admiration were cordially reciprocated by him i have frequently heard him speak of genl stuart as one of his warm personal friends  also express admiration for your soldierly qualities brandy stationedit the grand review of june  was surely the proudest day of jeb stuarts thirty years as he led a cavalcade of resplendent staff officers to the reviewing stand trumpeters heralded his coming and women and girls strewed his path with flowers before all of the spectators the assembled cavalry brigade stretched a mile and a half after stuart and his entourage galloped past the line in review the troopers in their turn saluted the reviewing stand in columns of squadrons in performing a second march past the squadrons started off at a trot then spurred to a gallop drawing sabers and breaking into the rebel yell the troopers rush toward the horse artillery drawn up in battery the gunners responded defiantly firing blank charges amidst this tumult of cannon fire and thundering hooves a number of ladies swooned in their escorts arms stephen w sears gettysburg battle of brandy station june   returning to the cavalry for the gettysburg campaign stuart endured the two low points in his career starting with the battle of brandy station the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war by june  two of lees infantry corps were camped in and around culpeper six miles northeast holding the line of the rappahannock river stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers mostly near brandy station screening the confederate army against surprise by the enemy stuart requested a full field review of his troops by gen lee this grand review on june  included nearly  mounted troopers and four batteries of horse artillery charging in simulated battle at inlet station about two miles three km southwest of brandy station lee was not able to attend the review however so it was repeated in his presence on june  although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations despite the lower level of activity some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all stuart was doing was feeding his ego and exhausting the horses lee ordered stuart to cross the rappahannock the next day and raid union forward positions screening the confederate army from observation or interference as it moved north anticipating this imminent offensive action stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around brandy station army of the potomac commander maj gen joseph hooker interpreted stuarts presence around culpeper to be indicative of preparations for a raid on his armys supply lines in reaction he ordered his cavalry commander maj gen alfred pleasonton to take a combined arms force of  cavalrymen and  infantry on a spoiling raid to disperse and destroy the  confederates pleasontons force crossed the rappahannock in two columns on june   the first crossing at beverlys ford brig gen john bufords division catching stuart by surprise waking him and his staff to the sound of gunfire the second crossing at kellys ford surprised stuart again and the confederates found themselves assaulted from front and rear in a spirited melee of mounted combat a series of confusing charges and countercharges swept back and forth across fleetwood hill which had been stuarts headquarters the previous night after ten hours of fighting pleasonton ordered his men to withdraw across the rappahannock if gen stuart is to be the eyes and ears of the army we advise him to see more and be seen less  gen stuart has suffered no little in public estimation by the late enterprises of the enemy richmond enquirer june   although stuart claimed a victory because the confederates held the field brandy station is considered a tactical draw and both sides came up short pleasonton was not able to disable stuarts force at the start of an important campaign and he withdrew before finding the location of lees infantry nearby however the fact that the southern cavalry had not detected the movement of two large columns of union cavalry and that they fell victim to a surprise attack was an embarrassment that prompted serious criticism from fellow generals and the southern press the fight also revealed the increased competency of the union cavalry and foreshadowed the decline of the formerly invincible southern mounted arm stuarts ride in the gettysburg campaignedit further information gettysburg campaign stuarts ride shown with a red dotted line during the gettysburg campaign june  – july   following a series of small cavalry battles in june as lees army began marching north through the shenandoah valley stuart may have had in mind the glory of circumnavigating the enemy army once again desiring to erase the stain on his reputation of the surprise at brandy station general lee gave orders to stuart on june  on how he was to participate in the march north and the exact nature of those orders has been argued by the participants and historians ever since but the essence was that he was instructed to guard the mountain passes with part of his force while the army of northern virginia was still south of the potomac and that he was to cross the river with the remainder of the army and screen the right flank of ewells second corps instead of taking a direct route north near the blue ridge mountains however stuart chose to reach ewells flank by taking his three best brigades those of brig gen wade hampton brig gen fitzhugh lee and col john r chambliss the latter replacing the wounded brig gen whf rooney lee between the union army and washington moving north through rockville to westminster and on into pennsylvania hoping to capture supplies along the way and cause havoc near the enemy capital stuart and his three brigades departed salem depot at  am on june  unfortunately for stuarts plan the union armys movement was underway and his proposed route was blocked by columns of federal infantry forcing him to veer farther to the east than either he or general lee had anticipated this prevented stuart from linking up with ewell as ordered and deprived lee of the use of his prime cavalry force the eyes and ears of the army while advancing into unfamiliar enemy territory stuarts command crossed the potomac river at  am on june  at rockville they captured a wagon train of  brandnew fully loaded wagons and mule teams this wagon train would prove to be a logistical hindrance to stuarts advance but he interpreted lees orders as placing importance on gathering supplies the proximity of the confederate raiders provoked some consternation in the national capital and two union cavalry brigades and an artillery battery were sent to pursue the confederates stuart supposedly said that were it not for his fatigued horses he would have marched down the th street road and took abe  cabinet prisoners in westminster on june  his men clashed briefly with and overwhelmed two companies of union cavalry chasing them a long distance on the baltimore road which stuart claimed caused a great panic in the city of baltimore the head of stuarts column encountered brig gen judson kilpatricks cavalry as it passed through hanover and scattered it on june  the battle of hanover ended after kilpatricks men regrouped and drove the confederates out of town stuarts brigades had been better positioned to guard their captured wagon train than to take advantage of the encounter with kilpatrick after a mile trek in the dark his exhausted men reached dover on the morning of july  as the battle of gettysburg was commencing without them stuart headed next for carlisle hoping to find ewell he lobbed a few shells into town during the early evening of july  and burned the carlisle barracks before withdrawing to the south towards gettysburg he and the bulk of his command reached lee at gettysburg the afternoon of july  he ordered wade hampton to cover the left rear of the confederate battle lines and hampton fought with brig gen george armstrong custer at the battle of hunterstown before joining stuart at gettysburg gettysburg and its aftermath edit when stuart arrived at gettysburg on the afternoon of july —bringing with him the caravan of captured union supply wagons—he received a rare rebuke from lee no one witnessed the private meeting between lee and stuart but reports circulated at headquarters that lees greeting was abrupt and frosty colonel edward porter alexander wrote although lee said only well general you are here at last his manner implied rebuke and it was so understood by stuart on the final day of the battle stuart was ordered to get into the enemys rear and disrupt its line of communications at the same time picketts charge was sent against the union positions on cemetery ridge but his attack on east cavalry field was repulsed by union cavalry under brig gens david gregg and george custer during the retreat from gettysburg stuart devoted his full attention to supporting the armys movement successfully screening against aggressive union cavalry pursuit and escorting thousands of wagons with wounded men and captured supplies over difficult roads and through inclement weather numerous skirmishes and minor battles occurred during the screening and delaying actions of the retreat stuarts men were the final units to cross the potomac river returning to virginia in wretched condition—completely worn out and broken down the failure to crush the federal army in pennsylvania in  in the opinion of almost all of the officers of the army of northern virginia can be expressed in five words—the absence of the cavalry confederate maj gen henry heth the gettysburg campaign was the most controversial of stuarts career he became one of the scapegoats along with james longstreet blamed for lees loss at gettysburg by proponents of the postbellum lost cause movement such as jubal early this was fueled in part by opinions of less partisan writers such as stuarts subordinate thomas l rosser who stated after the war that stuart did on this campaign undoubtedly make the fatal blunder which lost us the battle of gettysburg in general lees report on the campaign he wrote  the absence of the cavalry rendered it impossible to obtain accurate information  by the route stuart pursued the federal army was interposed between his command and our main body preventing any communication with him until his arrival at carlisle the march toward gettysburg was conducted more slowly than it would have been had the movements of the federal army been known one of the most forceful postbellum defenses of stuart was by col john s mosby who had served under him during the campaign and was fiercely loyal to the late general writing he made me all that i was in the war  but for his friendship i would never have been heard of he wrote numerous articles for popular publications and published a book length treatise in  a work that relied on his skills as a lawyer to refute categorically all of the claims laid against stuart modern scholarship remains divided on stuarts culpability edward g longacre argues that lee deliberately gave stuart wide discretion in his orders and had no complaints about stuarts tardy arrival at gettysburg because he established no date by which the cavalry was required to link up with ewell the ½ brigades of cavalry left with the main army were adequate for lee to negotiate enemy territory safely and that his choice not to use these brigades effectively cannot be blamed on stuart edwin b coddington refers to the tragedy of stuart in the gettysburg campaign and judges that when fitzhugh lee raised the question of whether stuart exercised the discretion undoubtedly given to him judiciously the answer is no nevertheless replying to historians who maintain that stuarts absence permitted lee to be surprised at gettysburg coddington points out that the union commander maj gen george meade was just as surprised and the initial advantage lay with lee eric j wittenberg and j david petruzzi have concluded that there was plenty of blame to go around and the fault should be divided between stuart the lack of specificity in lees orders and richard s ewell who might have tried harder to link up with stuart northeast of gettysburg jeffry d wert acknowledges that lee his officers and fighting by the army of the potomac bear the responsibility for the confederate loss at gettysburg but states that stuart failed lee and the army in the reckoning at gettysburg  lee trusted him and gave him discretion but stuart acted injudiciously although stuart was not reprimanded or disciplined in any official way for his role in the gettysburg campaign it is noteworthy that his appointment to corps command on september   did not carry with it a promotion to lieutenant general edward bonekemper wrote that since all other corps commanders in the army of northern virginia carried this rank lees decision to keep stuart at major general rank while at the same time promoting stuarts subordinates wade hampton and fitzhugh lee to major generals could be considered an implied rebuke jeffry d wert wrote that there is no evidence lee considered stuarts performance during the gettysburg campaign and that it is more likely that lee thought the responsibilities in command of a cavalry corps did not equal those of an infantry corps fall  and the  overland campaignedit the cavalrys success in the bristoe campaign can be attributed to the generalship boldness and untiring energy of majorgeneral stuart for it was he who directed every movement of importance and his generalship boldness and energy won the unbounded confidence of officers and men and gave the prestige of success confederate colonel oliver funsten bristoe campaign the  overland campaign including the battle of yellow tavern lee reorganized his cavalry on september  creating a cavalry corps for stuart with two divisions of three brigades each in the bristoe campaign stuart was assigned to lead a broad turning movement in an attempt to get into the enemys rear but general meade skillfully withdrew his army without leaving stuart any opportunities to take advantage of on october  stuart blundered into the rear guard of the union iii corps near warrenton ewells corps was sent to rescue him but stuart hid his troopers in a wooded ravine until the unsuspecting iii corps moved on and the assistance was not necessary as meade withdrew towards manassas junction brigades from the union ii corps fought a rearguard action against stuarts cavalry and the infantry of brig gen harry hayss division near auburn on october  stuarts cavalry boldly bluffed warrens infantry and escaped disaster after the confederate repulse at bristoe station and an aborted advance on centreville stuarts cavalry shielded the withdrawal of lees army from the vicinity of manassas junction judson kilpatricks union cavalry pursued stuarts cavalry along the warrenton turnpike but were lured into an ambush near chestnut hill and routed the federal troopers were scattered and chased five miles eight km in an affair that came to be known as the buckland races the southern press began to mute its criticism of stuart following his successful performance during the fall campaign the overland campaign lt gen ulysses s grants offensive against lee in the spring of  began at the battle of the wilderness where stuart aggressively pushed thomas l rossers laurel brigade into a fight against george custers betterarmed michigan brigade resulting in significant losses general lee sent a message to stuart it is very important to save your cavalry  not wear it out  you must use your good judgment to make any attack which may offer advantages as the armies maneuvered toward their next confrontation at spotsylvania court house stuarts cavalry fought delaying actions against the union cavalry his defense at laurel

organized a raid against confederate supply and railroad lines close to richmond which he knew would bring stuart to battle sheridan moved aggressively to the southeast crossing the north anna river and seizing beaver dam station on the virginia central railroad where his men captured a train liberating  union prisoners and destroying more than one million rations and medical supplies destined for lees army stuart dispatched a force of about  cavalrymen to intercept sheridans cavalry which was more than three times their numbers as he rode in pursuit accompanied by his aide maj andrew r

officer from the us state of virginia who later became a confederate states army general during the american civil war he was known to his friends as jeb from the initials of his given names stuart was a cavalry commander known for his mastery of reconnaissance and the use of cavalry in support of offensive operations while he cultivated a cavalier image redlined gray cape yellow sash hat cocked to the side with an ostrich plume red flower in his lapel often sporting cologne his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of robert e lees army and inspired southern morale stuart graduated from west point in  and served in texas and kansas with the us army he was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with native americans and the violence of bleeding kansas and he participated in the capture of john brown at harpers ferry he resigned when his home state of virginia seceded to serve in the confederate army first under stonewall jackson in the shenandoah valley but then in increasingly important cavalry commands of the army of northern virginia playing a role in all of that armys campaigns until his death he established a reputation as an audacious cavalry commander and on two occasions during the peninsula campaign and the maryland campaign circumnavigated the union army of the potomac bringing fame to himself and embarrassment to the north at the battle of chancellorsville he distinguished himself as a temporary commander of the wounded stonewall jacksons infantry corps arguably stuarts most famous campaign gettysburg was marred when he was surprised by a union cavalry attack at the battle of brandy station and by his separation from lees army for an extended period leaving lee unaware of union troop movements and contributing to the confederate defeat at the battle of gettysburg stuart received significant criticism from the southern press as well as the postbellum proponents of the lost cause movement but historians have failed to agree on whether stuarts exploit was entirely the fault of his judgment or simply a result of bad luck and lees lessthanexplicit orders during the  overland campaign union maj gen philip sheridans cavalry

was rejected as underaged he obtained an appointment in  to the united states military academy at west point new york from representative thomas hamlet averett the man who had defeated his father in the  election stuart was a popular student and was happy at the academy although not handsome in his teen years his classmates called him by the nickname beauty which they described as his personal comeliness in inverse ratio to the term employed he possessed a chin so short and retiring as positively to disfigure his otherwise fine countenance he quickly grew a beard after graduation and a fellow officer remarked that he was the only man he ever saw that a beard improved robert e lee was appointed superintendent of the academy in  and stuart became a friend of the lee family seeing them socially on frequent occasions lees nephew fitzhugh lee also arrived at the academy in  in stuarts final year in addition to achieving the cadet rank of second captain of the corps he was one of eight cadets designated as honorary cavalry officers for his skills in horsemanship stuart graduated th in his class of  in  he ranked tenth in his class in cavalry tactics although he enjoyed the civil engineering curriculum at the academy and did well in mathematics his poor drawing skills hampered his engineering studies and he finished th in that discipline a stuart family tradition says he deliberately degraded his academic performance in his final year to avoid service in the elite but dull corps of engineers united states armyedit stuart was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant and assigned to the us regiment of mounted riflemen in texas after an arduous journey he reached fort davis on january   and was a leader for three months on scouting missions over the san antonio to el paso road he was soon transferred to the newly formed st cavalry regiment  at fort leavenworth kansas territory where he became regimental quartermaster and commissary officer under the command of col edwin v sumner he was promoted to first lieutenant in  also in  stuart met flora cooke the daughter of the commander of the nd us dragoon regiment lieutenant colonel philip st george cooke burke davis described flora as an accomplished horsewoman and though not pretty an effective charmer to whom stuart succumbed with hardly a struggle  they became engaged in september less than two months after meeting stuart humorously wrote of his rapid courtship in latin veni vidi victus sum i came i saw i was conquered although a gala wedding was planned for fort riley kansas the death of stuarts father on september  caused a change of plans and the marriage on november  was small and limited to family witnesses the couple owned two slaves until  one inherited from his fathers estate the other purchased stuarts leadership capabilities were soon recognized he was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with native americans and the antebellum violence of bleeding kansas he was wounded on july   while fighting at solomon river kansas against the cheyenne col sumner ordered a charge with drawn sabers against a wave of indian arrows scattering the warriors stuart and three other lieutenants chased one down whom stuart wounded in the thigh with his pistol the cheyenne turned and fired at stuart with an oldfashioned pistol striking him in the chest with a bullet which did little more damage than to pierce the skin stuart returned in september to fort leavenworth and was reunited with his wife their first child a girl had been born in  but died the same day on november   flora gave birth to another daughter whom the parents named flora after her mother the family relocated in early  to fort riley where they remained for three years in  stuart developed a new piece of cavalry equipment for which he received patent number  on october —a saber hook or an improved method of attaching sabers to belts the us government paid stuart  for a right to use license and stuart contracted with knorr nece and co of philadelphia to manufacture his hook while in washington dc to discuss government contracts and in conjunction with his application for an appointment into the quartermaster department stuart heard about john browns raid on the us arsenal at harpers ferry stuart volunteered to be aidedecamp to col robert e lee and accompanied lee with a company of us marines from the marine barracks th  i washington dc and four companies of maryland militia while delivering lees written surrender ultimatum to the leader of the group who had been calling himself isaac smith stuart recognized old ossawatomie brown from his days in kansas stuart was promoted to captain on april   but resigned from the us army on may   to join the confederate states army following the secession of virginia his letter of resignation sent from cairo illinois was accepted by the war department on may  upon learning that his fatherinlaw col cooke would remain in the us army during the coming war stuart wrote to his brotherinlaw future confederate brig gen john rogers cooke he will regret it but once and that will be continuously  on june   flora gave birth to a son philip st george cooke stuart but his father changed the name to james ewell brown stuart jr jimmie in late  out of disgust with his fatherinlaw confederate armyedit early serviceedit stuart was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel of virginia infantry in the confederate army on may   maj gen robert e lee now commanding the armed forces of virginia ordered him to report to colonel thomas j jackson at harpers ferry jackson chose to ignore stuarts infantry designation and assigned him on july  to command all the cavalry companies of the army of the shenandoah organized as the st virginia cavalry regiment he was promoted to colonel on july  stuart is a rare man wonderfully endowed by nature with the qualities necessary for an officer of light cavalry  calm firm acute active and enterprising i know no one more competent than he to estimate the occurrences before him at their true value if you add to this army a real brigade of cavalry you can find no better brigadiergeneral to command it general joseph e johnston letter to confederate president jefferson davis august  after early service in the shenandoah valley stuart led his regiment in the first battle of bull run and participated in the pursuit of the retreating federals he then commanded the armys outposts along the upper potomac river until given command of the cavalry brigade for the army then known as the army of the potomac later named the army of northern virginia he was promoted to brigadier general on september   peninsulaedit in  the union army of the potomac began its peninsula campaign against richmond virginia and stuarts cavalry brigade assisted gen joseph e johnstons army as it withdrew up the virginia peninsula in the face of superior numbers stuart fought at the battle of williamsburg but in general the terrain and weather on the peninsula did not lend themselves to cavalry operations however when gen robert e lee became commander of the army of northern virginia he requested that stuart perform reconnaissance to determine whether the right flank of the union army was vulnerable stuart set out with  troopers on the morning of june  and having determined that the flank was indeed vulnerable took his men on a complete circumnavigation of the union army returning after  miles on july  with  captured union soldiers  horses and mules and various quartermaster and ordnance supplies his men met no serious opposition from the more decentralized union cavalry coincidentally commanded by his fatherinlaw col cooke the maneuver was a public relations sensation and stuart was greeted with flower petals thrown in his path at richmond he had become as famous as stonewall jackson in the eyes of the confederacy northern virginiaedit confederate cavalry general jeb stuart early in the northern virginia campaign stuart was promoted to major general on july   and his command was upgraded to the cavalry division he was nearly captured and lost his signature plumed hat and cloak to pursuing federals during a raid in august but in a retaliatory raid at catletts station the following day managed to overrun union army commander maj gen john popes headquarters and not only captured popes full uniform but also intercepted orders that provided lee with valuable intelligence concerning reinforcements for popes army at the second battle of bull run second manassas stuarts cavalry followed the massive assault by longstreets infantry against popes army protecting its flank with artillery batteries stuart ordered brig gen beverly robertsons brigade to pursue the federals and in a sharp fight against brig gen john bufords brigade col thomas t munfords nd virginia cavalry was overwhelmed until stuart sent in two more regiments as reinforcements bufords men many of whom were new to combat retreated across lewiss ford and stuarts troopers captured over  of them stuarts men harassed the retreating union columns until the campaign ended at the battle of chantilly marylandedit during the maryland campaign of september  stuarts cavalry screened the armys movement north he bears some responsibility for robert e lees lack of knowledge of the position and celerity of the pursuing army of the potomac under george b mcclellan for a fiveday period stuart rested his men and entertained local civilians at a gala ball at urbana maryland his reports make no reference to intelligence gathering by his scouts or patrols as the union army drew near to lees divided army stuarts men skirmished at various points on the approach to frederick and stuart was not able to keep his brigades concentrated enough to resist the oncoming tide he misjudged the union routes of advance ignorant of the union force threatening turners gap and required assistance from the infantry of maj gen dh hill to defend the south mountain passes in the battle of south mountain his horse artillery bombarded the flank of the union army as it opened its attack in the battle of antietam by midafternoon stonewall jackson ordered stuart to command a turning movement with his cavalry against the union right flank and rear which if successful would be followed up by an infantry attack from the west woods stuart began probing the union lines with more artillery barrages which were answered with murderous counterbattery fire and the cavalry movement intended by jackson was never launched stuart and jackson were an unlikely pair one outgoing the other introverted one flashily uniformed the other plainly dressed one prince rupert and the other cromwell yet stuarts selfconfidence penchant for action deep love of virginia and total abstinence from such vices as alcohol tobacco and pessimism endeared him to jackson  stuart was the only man in the confederacy who could make jackson laugh—and who dared to do so james i robertson jr stonewall jackson three weeks after lees army had withdrawn back to virginia on october –  stuart performed another of his audacious circumnavigations of the army of the potomac his chambersburg raid— miles in under  hours from darkesville west virginia to as far north as mercersburg pennsylvania and chambersburg and around to the east through emmitsburg maryland and south through hyattstown maryland and whites ford to leesburg virginia—once again embarrassing his union opponents and seizing horses and supplies but at the expense of exhausted men and animals without gaining much military advantage jubal early referred to it as the greatest horse stealing expedition that only annoyed the enemy stuart gave his friend jackson a fine new officers tunic trimmed with gold lace commissioned from a richmond tailor which he thought would give jackson more of the appearance of a proper general something to which jackson was notoriously indifferent mcclellan pushed his army slowly south urged by president lincoln to pursue lee crossing the potomac starting on october  as lee began moving to counter this stuart screened longstreets corps and skirmished numerous times in early november against union cavalry and infantry around mountville aldie and upperville on november  stuart received sad news by telegram that his daughter flora had died just before her fifth birthday of typhoid fever on november  fredericksburg and chancellorsvilleedit in the december  battle of fredericksburg stuart and his cavalry—most notably his horse artillery under major john pelham—protected stonewall jacksons flank at hamiltons crossing general lee commended his cavalry which effectually guarded our right annoying the enemy and embarrassing his movements by hanging on his flank and attacking when the opportunity occurred stuart reported to flora the next day that he had been shot through his fur collar but was unhurt after christmas lee ordered stuart to conduct a raid north of the rappahannock river to penetrate the enemys rear ascertain if possible his position  movements  inflict upon him such damage as circumstances will permit with  troopers and a horse artillery battery assigned to the operation stuarts raid reached as far north as four miles south of fairfax court house seizing  prisoners horses mules and supplies tapping telegraph lines his signalmen intercepted messages between union commanders and stuart sent a personal telegram to union quartermaster general montgomery c meigs general meigs will in the future please furnish better mules those you have furnished recently are very inferior on march   stuarts cavalry clashed with a union raiding party at kellys ford the minor victory was marred by the death of major pelham which caused stuart profound grief as he thought of him as close as a younger brother he wrote to a confederate congressman the noble the chivalric the gallant pelham is no more  let the tears of agony we have shed and the gloom of mourning throughout my command bear witness flora was pregnant at the time and stuart told her that if it were a boy he wanted him to be named john pelham stuart virginia pelham stuart was born october  chancellorsville may     confederaterebels   unionfederals at the battle of chancellorsville stuart accompanied stonewall jackson on his famous flanking march of may   and started to pursue the retreating soldiers of the union xi corps when he received word that both jackson and his senior division commander maj gen ap hill had been wounded hill bypassing the next most senior infantry general in the corps brig gen robert e rodes sent a message ordering stuart to take command of the second corps although the delays associated with this change of command effectively ended the flanking attack the night of may  stuart performed credibly as an infantry corps commander the following day launching a strong and wellcoordinated attack against the union right flank at chancellorsville when union troops abandoned hazel grove stuart had the presence of mind to quickly occupy it and bombard the union positions with artillery stuart relinquished his infantry command on may  when hill returned to duty stephen w sears wrote  it is hard to see how jeb stuart in a new command a cavalryman commanding infantry and artillery for the first time could have done a better job the astute porter alexander believed all credit was due altogether i do not think there was a more brilliant thing done in the war than stuarts extricating that command from the extremely critical position in which he found it stonewall jackson died on may  and stuart was once again devastated by the loss of a close friend telling his staff that the death was a national calamity jacksons wife mary anna wrote to stuart on august  thanking him for a note of sympathy i need not assure you of which you already know that your friendship  admiration were cordially reciprocated by him i have frequently heard him speak of genl stuart as one of his warm personal friends  also express admiration for your soldierly qualities brandy stationedit the grand review of june  was surely the proudest day of jeb stuarts thirty years as he led a cavalcade of resplendent staff officers to the reviewing stand trumpeters heralded his coming and women and girls strewed his path with flowers before all of the spectators the assembled cavalry brigade stretched a mile and a half after stuart and his entourage galloped past the line in review the troopers in their turn saluted the reviewing stand in columns of squadrons in performing a second march past the squadrons started off at a trot then spurred to a gallop drawing sabers and breaking into the rebel yell the troopers rush toward the horse artillery drawn up in battery the gunners responded defiantly firing blank charges amidst this tumult of cannon fire and thundering hooves a number of ladies swooned in their escorts arms stephen w sears gettysburg battle of brandy station june   returning to the cavalry for the gettysburg campaign stuart endured the two low points in his career starting with the battle of brandy station the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war by june  two of lees infantry corps were camped in and around culpeper six miles northeast holding the line of the rappahannock river stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers mostly near brandy station screening the confederate army against surprise by the enemy stuart requested a full field review of his troops by gen lee this grand review on june  included nearly  mounted troopers and four batteries of horse artillery charging in simulated battle at inlet station about two miles three km southwest of brandy station lee was not able to attend the review however so it was repeated in his presence on june  although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations despite the lower level of activity some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all stuart was doing was feeding his ego and exhausting the horses lee ordered stuart to cross the rappahannock the next day and raid union forward positions screening the confederate army from observation or interference as it moved north anticipating this imminent offensive action stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around brandy station army of the potomac commander maj gen joseph hooker interpreted stuarts presence around culpeper to be indicative of preparations for a raid on his armys supply lines in reaction he ordered his cavalry commander maj gen alfred pleasonton to take a combined arms force of  cavalrymen and  infantry on a spoiling raid to disperse and destroy the  confederates pleasontons force crossed the rappahannock in two columns on june   the first crossing at beverlys ford brig gen john bufords division catching stuart by surprise waking him and his staff to the sound of gunfire the second crossing at kellys ford surprised stuart again and the confederates found themselves assaulted from front and rear in a spirited melee of mounted combat a series of confusing charges and countercharges swept back and forth across fleetwood hill which had been stuarts headquarters the previous night after ten hours of fighting pleasonton ordered his men to withdraw across the rappahannock if gen stuart is to be the eyes and ears of the army we advise him to see more and be seen less  gen stuart has suffered no little in public estimation by the late enterprises of the enemy richmond enquirer june   although stuart claimed a victory because the confederates held the field brandy station is considered a tactical draw and both sides came up short pleasonton was not able to disable stuarts force at the start of an important campaign and he withdrew before finding the location of lees infantry nearby however the fact that the southern cavalry had not detected the movement of two large columns of union cavalry and that they fell victim to a surprise attack was an embarrassment that prompted serious criticism from fellow generals and the southern press the fight also revealed the increased competency of the union cavalry and foreshadowed the decline of the formerly invincible southern mounted arm stuarts ride in the gettysburg campaignedit further information gettysburg campaign stuarts ride shown with a red dotted line during the gettysburg campaign june  – july   following a series of small cavalry battles in june as lees army began marching north through the shenandoah valley stuart may have had in mind the glory of circumnavigating the enemy army once again desiring to erase the stain on his reputation of the surprise at brandy station general lee gave orders to stuart on june  on how he was to participate in the march north and the exact nature of those orders has been argued by the participants and historians ever since but the essence was that he was instructed to guard the mountain passes with part of his force while the army of northern virginia was still south of the potomac and that he was to cross the river with the remainder of the army and screen the right flank of ewells second corps instead of taking a direct route north near the blue ridge mountains however stuart chose to reach ewells flank by taking his three best brigades those of brig gen wade hampton brig gen fitzhugh lee and col john r chambliss the latter replacing the wounded brig gen whf rooney lee between the union army and washington moving north through rockville to westminster and on into pennsylvania hoping to capture supplies along the way and cause havoc near the enemy capital stuart and his three brigades departed salem depot at  am on june  unfortunately for stuarts plan the union armys movement was underway and his proposed route was blocked by columns of federal infantry forcing him to veer farther to the east than either he or general lee had anticipated this prevented stuart from linking up with ewell as ordered and deprived lee of the use of his prime cavalry force the eyes and ears of the army while advancing into unfamiliar enemy territory stuarts command crossed the potomac river at  am on june  at rockville they captured a wagon train of  brandnew fully loaded wagons and mule teams this wagon train would prove to be a logistical hindrance to stuarts advance but he interpreted lees orders as placing importance on gathering supplies the proximity of the confederate raiders provoked some consternation in the national capital and two union cavalry brigades and an artillery battery were sent to pursue the confederates stuart supposedly said that were it not for his fatigued horses he would have marched down the th street road and took abe  cabinet prisoners in westminster on june  his men clashed briefly with and overwhelmed two companies of union cavalry chasing them a long distance on the baltimore road which stuart claimed caused a great panic in the city of baltimore the head of stuarts column encountered brig gen judson kilpatricks cavalry as it passed through hanover and scattered it on june  the battle of hanover ended after kilpatricks men regrouped and drove the confederates out of town stuarts brigades had been better positioned to guard their captured wagon train than to take advantage of the encounter with kilpatrick after a mile trek in the dark his exhausted men reached dover on the morning of july  as the battle of gettysburg was commencing without them stuart headed next for carlisle hoping to find ewell he lobbed a few shells into town during the early evening of july  and burned the carlisle barracks before withdrawing to the south towards gettysburg he and the bulk of his command reached lee at gettysburg the afternoon of july  he ordered wade hampton to cover the left rear of the confederate battle lines and hampton fought with brig gen george armstrong custer at the battle of hunterstown before joining stuart at gettysburg gettysburg and its aftermath edit when stuart arrived at gettysburg on the afternoon of july —bringing with him the caravan of captured union supply wagons—he received a rare rebuke from lee no one witnessed the private meeting between lee and stuart but reports circulated at headquarters that lees greeting was abrupt and frosty colonel edward porter alexander wrote although lee said only well general you are here at last his manner implied rebuke and it was so understood by stuart on the final day of the battle stuart was ordered to get into the enemys rear and disrupt its line of communications at the same time picketts charge was sent against the union positions on cemetery ridge but his attack on east cavalry field was repulsed by union cavalry under brig gens david gregg and george custer during the retreat from gettysburg stuart devoted his full attention to supporting the armys movement successfully screening against aggressive union cavalry pursuit and escorting thousands of wagons with wounded men and captured supplies over difficult roads and through inclement weather numerous skirmishes and minor battles occurred during the screening and delaying actions of the retreat stuarts men were the final units to cross the potomac river returning to virginia in wretched condition—completely worn out and broken down the failure to crush the federal army in pennsylvania in  in the opinion of almost all of the officers of the army of northern virginia can be expressed in five words—the absence of the cavalry confederate maj gen henry heth the gettysburg campaign was the most controversial of stuarts career he became one of the scapegoats along with james longstreet blamed for lees loss at gettysburg by proponents of the postbellum lost cause movement such as jubal early this was fueled in part by opinions of less partisan writers such as stuarts subordinate thomas l rosser who stated after the war that stuart did on this campaign undoubtedly make the fatal blunder which lost us the battle of gettysburg in general lees report on the campaign he wrote  the absence of the cavalry rendered it impossible to obtain accurate information  by the route stuart pursued the federal army was interposed between his command and our main body preventing any communication with him until his arrival at carlisle the march toward gettysburg was conducted more slowly than it would have been had the movements of the federal army been known one of the most forceful postbellum defenses of stuart was by col john s mosby who had served under him during the campaign and was fiercely loyal to the late general writing he made me all that i was in the war  but for his friendship i would never have been heard of he wrote numerous articles for popular publications and published a book length treatise in  a work that relied on his skills as a lawyer to refute categorically all of the claims laid against stuart modern scholarship remains divided on stuarts culpability edward g longacre argues that lee deliberately gave stuart wide discretion in his orders and had no complaints about stuarts tardy arrival at gettysburg because he established no date by which the cavalry was required to link up with ewell the ½ brigades of cavalry left with the main army were adequate for lee to negotiate enemy territory safely and that his choice not to use these brigades effectively cannot be blamed on stuart edwin b coddington refers to the tragedy of stuart in the gettysburg campaign and judges that when fitzhugh lee raised the question of whether stuart exercised the discretion undoubtedly given to him judiciously the answer is no nevertheless replying to historians who maintain that stuarts absence permitted lee to be surprised at gettysburg coddington points out that the union commander maj gen george meade was just as surprised and the initial advantage lay with lee eric j wittenberg and j david petruzzi have concluded that there was plenty of blame to go around and the fault should be divided between stuart the lack of specificity in lees orders and richard s ewell who might have tried harder to link up with stuart northeast of gettysburg jeffry d wert acknowledges that lee his officers and fighting by the army of the potomac bear the responsibility for the confederate loss at gettysburg but states that stuart failed lee and the army in the reckoning at gettysburg  lee trusted him and gave him discretion but stuart acted injudiciously although stuart was not reprimanded or disciplined in any official way for his role in the gettysburg campaign it is noteworthy that his appointment to corps command on september   did not carry with it a promotion to lieutenant general edward bonekemper wrote that since all other corps commanders in the army of northern virginia carried this rank lees decision to keep stuart at major general rank while at the same time promoting stuarts subordinates wade hampton and fitzhugh lee to major generals could be considered an implied rebuke jeffry d wert wrote that there is no evidence lee considered stuarts performance during the gettysburg campaign and that it is more likely that lee thought the responsibilities in command of a cavalry corps did not equal those of an infantry corps fall  and the  overland campaignedit the cavalrys success in the bristoe campaign can be attributed to the generalship boldness and untiring energy of majorgeneral

brown was born in brooklyn new york the son of evelyn a homemaker and harvey brown a textile salesman graduated from cheltenham high school wyncote pa brown graduated from the university of pennsylvania in  and received his md from the university of pennsylvania school of medicine in  career and researchedit moving to the university of texas health science center in dallas now the ut southwestern medical center brown and colleague joseph l goldstein researched cholesterol metabolism and discovered that human cells have lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptors that extract cholesterol from the bloodstream the lack of sufficient ldl receptors is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia which predisposes heavily for cholesterolrelated diseases in addition to explaining the underlying pathology of this disease their work uncovered a fundamental aspect of cell biology  receptormediated endocytosis their findings led to the development of statin drugs the cholesterollowering compounds that today are used by  million americans and are the most widely prescribed medications in the united states their discoveries are improving more lives every year both in the united states and around the worldneeds citation new federal cholesterol guidelines will triple the number of americans taking statin drugs to lower their cholesterol reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke for countless people following these important advances their team of dedicated researchers elucidated the role of lipid modification of proteins protein prenylation in cancer in

goldstein in  for describing the regulation of cholesterol metabolism contents  education and early life  career and research  awards and honors  bibliography  references education and early lifeedit brown was born in brooklyn new york the son of evelyn a homemaker and harvey brown a textile salesman graduated from cheltenham high school wyncote pa brown graduated from the university of pennsylvania in  and received his md from the university of pennsylvania school of medicine in  career and researchedit moving to the university of texas health science center in dallas now the ut southwestern medical center brown and colleague joseph l goldstein researched cholesterol metabolism and discovered that human cells have lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptors that extract cholesterol from the bloodstream the lack of sufficient ldl receptors is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia which predisposes heavily for cholesterolrelated diseases in addition to explaining the underlying pathology of this disease their work uncovered a fundamental aspect of cell biology  receptormediated endocytosis their findings led to the development of statin drugs the cholesterollowering compounds that today are used by  million americans and are the most widely prescribed medications in the united states their discoveries are improving more lives every year both in the united states and around the worldneeds citation new federal cholesterol guidelines will triple the number of americans taking statin drugs to lower their cholesterol reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke for countless people following these important advances their team of dedicated researchers elucidated the role of lipid modification of proteins protein prenylation in cancer in  he was awarded the louisa gross horwitz prize from columbia university together with joseph l goldstein corecipient of  nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  brown received national medal of science for his contributions to the world of medicine in  their trainees xiaodong wang and michael briggs purified the sterol regulatory element binding proteins srebps since  drs brown goldstein and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery by which cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances dr brown holds the w a monty moncrief distinguished chair in cholesterol and arteriosclerosis research is a regental professor of the university of texas holds the paul j thomas chair in medicine and is a member of the board of scientific directors at the scripps research institute frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationallyprominent positions in scientific administration dr brown like his colleague joseph l goldstein elects to continue handson involvement with research leading a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees he and his colleague are among the most highly cited scientists in the world brown is also on the prestigious prix galien usa committee that recognizes the technical scientific and clinical research skills necessary to develop innovative medicines the inauguration of the prix galien in the us the equivalent of the nobel prize in this field was in september  and the winners were selected by a preeminent scientific

brown was born in brooklyn new york the son of evelyn a homemaker and harvey brown a textile salesman graduated from cheltenham high school wyncote pa brown graduated from the university of pennsylvania in  and received his md from the university of pennsylvania school of medicine in  career and researchedit moving to the university of texas health science center in dallas now the ut southwestern medical center brown and colleague joseph l goldstein researched cholesterol metabolism and discovered that human cells have lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptors that extract cholesterol from the bloodstream the lack of sufficient ldl receptors is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia which predisposes heavily for cholesterolrelated diseases in addition to explaining the underlying pathology of this disease their work uncovered a fundamental aspect of cell biology  receptormediated endocytosis their findings led to the development of statin drugs the cholesterollowering compounds that today are used by  million americans and are the most widely prescribed medications in the united states their discoveries are improving more lives every year both in the united states and around the worldneeds citation new federal cholesterol guidelines will triple the number of americans taking statin drugs to lower their cholesterol reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke for countless people following these important advances their team of dedicated researchers elucidated the role of lipid modification of proteins protein prenylation in cancer in  he was awarded the louisa gross horwitz prize from columbia university together with joseph l goldstein corecipient of  nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  brown received national medal of science for his contributions to the world of medicine in  their trainees xiaodong wang and michael briggs purified the sterol regulatory element binding proteins srebps since  drs brown goldstein and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery by which cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances dr brown holds the w a monty moncrief distinguished chair in cholesterol and arteriosclerosis research is a regental professor of the university of texas holds the paul j thomas chair in medicine and is a member of the board of scientific directors at the scripps research institute frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationallyprominent positions in scientific administration dr brown like his colleague joseph l goldstein elects to continue handson involvement with research leading a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees he and his colleague are among the most highly cited scientists in the world brown is also on the prestigious prix galien usa committee that recognizes the technical scientific and clinical research skills necessary to develop innovative medicines the inauguration of the prix galien in the us the equivalent of the nobel prize in this field was in september  and the winners were selected by a preeminent scientific

brown was born in brooklyn new york the son of evelyn a homemaker and harvey brown a textile salesman graduated from cheltenham high school wyncote pa brown graduated from the university of pennsylvania in  and received his md from the university of pennsylvania school of medicine in  career and researchedit moving to the university of texas health science center in dallas now the ut southwestern medical center brown and colleague joseph l goldstein researched cholesterol metabolism and discovered that human cells have lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptors that extract cholesterol from the bloodstream the lack of sufficient ldl receptors is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia which predisposes heavily for cholesterolrelated diseases in addition to explaining the underlying pathology of this disease their work uncovered a fundamental aspect of cell biology  receptormediated endocytosis their findings led to the development of statin drugs the cholesterollowering compounds that today are used by  million americans and are the most widely prescribed medications in the united states their discoveries are improving more lives every year both in the united states and around the worldneeds citation new federal cholesterol guidelines will triple the number of americans taking statin drugs to lower their cholesterol reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke for countless people following these important advances their team of dedicated researchers elucidated the role of lipid modification of proteins protein prenylation in cancer in  he was awarded the louisa gross horwitz prize from columbia university together with joseph l goldstein corecipient of  nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  brown received national medal of science for his contributions to the world of medicine in  their trainees xiaodong wang and michael briggs purified the sterol regulatory element binding proteins srebps since  drs brown goldstein and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery by which cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances dr brown holds the w a monty moncrief distinguished chair in cholesterol and arteriosclerosis research is a regental professor of the university of texas holds the paul j thomas chair in medicine and is a member of the board of scientific directors at the scripps research institute frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationallyprominent positions in scientific administration dr brown like his colleague joseph l goldstein elects to continue handson involvement with research leading a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees he and his colleague are among the most highly cited scientists in the world brown is also on the prestigious prix galien usa committee that recognizes the technical scientific and clinical research skills necessary to develop innovative medicines the inauguration of the prix galien in the us the equivalent of the nobel prize in this field was in september  and the winners were selected by a preeminent scientific

sanction also known as a disciplinary action is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board professional medical licensing organization or the us department of health and human servicesif my doctor has sanction history does that mean he or she is a poorquality doctorif a doctor has a sanction it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poorquality doctor some sanctions are not related to medical care and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities before you make any choices about changing your doctor we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action werehow far back

first time it has happened the last time we got left in the room till  when they closed and then was told they forgot we were even in the room what is the point of a appointmentmandajean in miami fl
