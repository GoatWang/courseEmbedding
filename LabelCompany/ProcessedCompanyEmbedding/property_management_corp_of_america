eventually statewide we offer exceptional customer service and very competitive pricing which we believe sets us apart from other property management companies as we grow we plan to add additional employees with specific skills to enhance our service offerings we believe the inhouse skill set will enable us to enhance our profitability as we will not need to subcontract these services additionally management has been reviewing and considering other business opportunities in industries outside of the property management industry results of operations three month period ended august

marketing and sales professional services such as legal and accounting and other general and administrative costs liquidity and capital resources from january   inception through august   we relied on funds loaned to us by washington capital advisors llc a company controlled by c thomas mcmillen our president and chief executive officer those loans were in the cumulative amount of  and were used to fund our working capital requirements on july   we repaid washington capital advisors  including interest and principal from funds received from the sale of our common stock which totaled  see below at august   the outstanding loan amount due washington capital advisors was  including accrued interest of  washington capital advisors has agreed to loan us additional amounts of up to a total of  inclusive of the currently outstanding loan amount see note we completed our public offering on july   we used the proceeds of this offering after the repayment of a portion of our working capital loans to expand our company primarily in our marketing efforts and for general working capital purposes we will need to raise additional capital to carry out our business plan we believe that our additional capital needs will be approximately  over the next  months to fully carry out our business plan we expect to raise these additional funds through the issuance of debt obligations and private placements of our common stock however there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or if we are able to raise additional capital that the terms will be acceptable to us we do not currently have any agreements or understandings with any potential financing sources other than washington capital advisors and we have not identified any other potential lenders to provide capital on june   the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock through three  private placements of  shares each the company received  dollars in proceeds from this sale share the shares were sold privately as unregistered shares subject to rule  of the securities act of  as amended our current expansion and growth plans include establishing satellite offices in counties contiguous to fauquier county virginia during  and eventually statewide throughout  initially we will seek to establish these offices in properties that we manage or alternatively focus on geographic areas we identify as in need of our services this expansion will require additional capital we plan to raise this additional capital through debt obligations and private placements of our common stock failure to raise additional capital will lengthen the time and decrease the scope of our expansion and growth plans also management has considered exploring businesses opportunities outside of our current industry focus if the company were to find a business opportunity outside of the property management industry management believes that additional funding would still be necessary in order for the company to take advantage of any given opportunity the company had cash on hand of  at august   our primary needs for cash are to fund and grow our ongoing operations however we will require additional capital to fully carry out our business plan during the six months ended august   the company had a net increase in cash of  the companys sources and uses of cash were as follows cash flows from operating activities we used net cash of  in our operating activities during the six months ended august   consisting of a net loss of  increased by net uses of cash totaling  due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities cash flows from financing activities we provided net cash of  in our financing activities during the six months ended august   consisting of the proceeds from the sale of our common stock of  increased by proceeds from loans to us from washington capital advisors of  as of august   the company had negative working capital of  offbalance sheet arrangements the company was not a party to any offbalance sheet arrangements during the six months ended august   significant and critical accounting policies and practices the management of the company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the companys significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles fiscal year end the company elected february th as its fiscal year end date upon its formation use of estimates and assumptions and critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods critical accounting estimates are estimates for which a the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and b the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material the companys critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were i assumption as a going concern management assumes that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business these significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information changes in facts and circumstances historical experience and reasonable assumptions after such evaluations if deemed appropriate those estimates are adjusted accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates related parties the company follows subtopic  of the fasb accounting standards codification for the identification of related

which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the companys financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses if determinable and material would be disclosed loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantees would be disclosed revenue recognition the company follows paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is

stock whether or not paid and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock whether or not earned from income from continuing operations if that amount appears in the income statement and also from net income the computation of diluted eps is similar to the computation of basic eps except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement stock options or warrants pursuant to asc paragraphs  through  diluted eps shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder the dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants and their equivalents issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted eps by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs  through  and  through  require that another method be applied equivalents of options and warrants include nonvested stock granted to employees stock purchase contracts and partially paid stock subscriptions see paragraph  antidilutive contracts such as purchased put options and purchased call options shall be excluded from diluted

growth plans for the future include establishing satellite offices in counties contiguous with fauquier county virginia and eventually statewide we offer exceptional customer service and very competitive pricing which we believe sets us apart from other property management companies as we grow we plan to add additional employees with specific skills to enhance our service offerings we believe the inhouse skill set will enable us to enhance our profitability as we will not have to subcontract any off our services results of operations the discussion below compares the companys results for the periods ended february   and february   these results reflect the normal operations of our business although we offer various services under our management services agreements we do

approximately  over the next  months to fully carry out our business plan we expect to raise these additional funds through the issuance of debt obligations andor private placement of our common stock however there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or if we are able to raise additional capital that the terms will be acceptable to us we do not currently have any

management and consulting services to residential and commercial real estate property owners who rent or lease their property to third party tenants   going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business as reflected in the accompanying financial statements during the three months ended may   the company incurred a net loss of  used cash in operations of  and at may   had a stockholders deficit of  these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   the company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue however the company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations while the company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds   note  – summary of significant accounting policies   use of estimates   the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period significant estimates include accounting for potential liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates   basic and diluted loss per share   basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued for the three months ended may   the basic and diluted shares outstanding were the same as there were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding   fair value of financial instruments   under current accounting guidance fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged or a liability transferred in a transaction between knowledgeable willing parties in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability where available fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters where observable prices or parameters are not available valuation models are applied a fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows   level  – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities       f          level  – inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets are observable either directly or indirectly level  – unobservable inputs based on the companys assumptions   the company is required to use observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort as of may   the amounts reported for cash accounts payable and accrued liabilities and notes payable approximated fair value because of their shortterm maturities   recently issued accounting pronouncements   in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with customers asu  is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current us gaap and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition asu  will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract the asu also will require additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract asu  is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods therein entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of asu  on the company’s financial statements and disclosures   in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  leases asu  requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than  months asu  is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with certain practical expedients available the company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related disclosures   other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force the american institute of certified public accountants and the securities and exchange commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the companys present or future consolidated financial statements   note  – related party
