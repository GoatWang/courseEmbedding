via feebased contracts which are usually capacity and not pricedriven they have less direct exposure to commodity prices than more traditional equity investments the sector has become more investable in the last few years and in our view has reached the critical mass needed to achieve sufficient diversification with an attractive riskreturn profile pimco mlp  energy infrastructure strategy focuses on total return rather than simply yield whilst the target universe is predominantly equity securities the strategy has the flexibility to tactically invest in both the equity and debt of midstream energy companies this allows us to look for the best opportunities across the whole capital structure q what is your outlook for the mlp sector devir the mlp sector has rebounded strongly over the last  months in line with oil prices stabilizing although the sector underperformed in  when a number of large companies cut dividends much of this was due to companyspecific issues rather than problems with business models as a whole – a point we made in a blog post in september since then our views haven’t changed we think mlps continue to offer attractive longterm total return potential backed by a favorable blend of fundamental and technical factors q can you talk more about the fundamental and technical factors supporting this view devir from a topdown perspective we think that oil prices are likely to be more stable going forward underpinned by strong global demand growth and better production discipline by opec this should lead to an increase in north american production which would be positive for midstream mlps as it means higher volumes through the pipelines and higher revenues for the sector we also think that the trump administration could be net positive for the energy sector – for example we already saw support for the keystone pipeline within the administration’s first week and if inflation picks up as the market expects mlps should perform well as many revenue streams are inflationlinked from the bottom up mlp balancesheet quality has improved as a result of deleveraging in the last  months‒ months and the worst of the ratings downgrade cycle is likely behind us importantly we see some  billion‒ billion of growth opportunities for mlps during fy which should allow them to increase distributions over time in fact we expect distributions to grow by ‒ over the coming years – a stark contrast to the market’s expectations judging by current prices many investors expect distribution cuts in  and no growth in distributions over the next three to four years in terms of valuations the mlp sector is trading at a discount to longterm averages yielding  versus an average close to  reflecting greater uncertainty among investors mlps have also historically traded at lower yields than high yield bonds but currently they are yielding  basis points more see figure  in our view these valuation levels are attractive as fundamentals are stronger than what the market is pricing in q are there any risks to this outlook devir while much of the damage from lower oil prices has played out certain companies in the exploration and production ep sector still face credit issues we do not generally see nearterm refinancing risk but some firms could be challenged if oil prices stay below bbl given their operating costs however it should be noted that the pimco mlp  energy infrastructure strategy is focused on midstream assets pipelines not upstream assets ep q can you comment on pimco’s experience investing in midstream energy bek ahmedov pimco has been investing in energy for many years – including the debt and equity of firms across the ep pipeline integrated oil coal refining chemicals and utilities sectors we have a worldrenown team of portfolio managers and dedicated energy credit analysts who conduct fundamental analysis across the energy value chain our credit research team also benefits from the insights of pimco’s commodity team who are experts in supplyanddemand dynamics within crude oil natural gas and other commodity markets we think we have a particular edge in differentiating winners and losers within the mlp sector given our experience of investing in mlp debt for over a decade and our role as one of the largest lenders to the sector we have indepth knowledge of individual companies both at the individual operating subsidiary level individual pipelines and at the corporate level we tend to know the underlying assets of mlps very well because they often issue debt q what is your approach to analyzing mlps devir we incorporate a view on underlying commodity prices and their impact on companies from the viewpoint of both debt and equity investors we then conduct exhaustive primary research and modeling on each target company leveraging over a decade of onthe ground research and relationships with issuers we look for opportunities across the capital structure focusing on companies with high barriers to entry and attractive assets in high growth and lowcost production regions we aim to invest in companies with a sustainable cost advantage operated by experienced management with proven geological expertise q what role can the strategy play in a portfolio ahmedov we see its primary role as an incomeproducing solution in a multiasset portfolio it can serve as an alternative or complement to equities and high yield bonds in light of its relatively high distribution yields and the potential for distribution growth see figure  historically over longer time periods mlps have generated similar returns to equities with similar to slightly higher levels of volatility but lower correlations to broad equity and fixed income markets so from that point of view the strategy can also be used as a diversifier within a portfolio for energyfocused investors it can be used to diversify existing energyrelated equity investments as mlps are not included in broad benchmarks finally the strategy could be used as an inflationhedging solution mlps own physical infrastructure assets which in many cases have revenues with builtin inflation escalators that may make this strategy attractive for the inflation hedging buckets within portfolios q how important is active management in this sector ahmedov valuations and returns of mlp equities have historically varied significantly due to differences in business models barriers to entry counterparty quality cost differences in production regions and the experience of management teams in  the bestperforming mlp in the market was up more than  whereas the worst performing company was down close to  see figure  this level of dispersion has existed since the inception of the asset class and in our opinion makes active management with the resource to help pick winners and losers an essential component of investment success summary mlps are usbased public partnerships most common in the energy sector they derive their revenues from operating critical infrastructure including transportation pipelines for crude oil the sector faced challenges in  and  when oil prices fell but has rebounded strongly over the last year backed by a favorable blend of fundamental and technical factors pimco mlp  energy infrastructure is an actively managed strategy focused on total return rather than simply yield which can provide investors flexible exposure to north american midsteam energy assets mlp facts and figures master limited partnerships mlps are usbased publicly traded partnerships listed and traded on a public exchange they are most common in the energy industry providing and managing resources such as oil and gas pipelines mlps typically have two types of investors limited partners lps also known as unitholders provide equity capital to the company but play no role in the partnership’s management they receive regular cash distributions general partners gps manage the daily operations of the partnership they typically hold a  equity ownership in the lp and are entitled to receive incentive distribution payments  some gp interests are also publicly traded mlps differ from ccorp companies the typical legal structure of a us corporation in their taxation they do not pay taxes at a corporate level but instead make regular distributions to lp unitholders the elimination of double taxation ccorp shareholders pay both corporate tax and then individual tax on their distributions lowers an mlp’s cost of capital and supports higher asset valuation in an mlp structure versus a ccorp structure as of  december  there were close to  mlps with a total market capitalization of  billion according to the mlp association the market has four main sub sectors crude oil transportation natural gas
