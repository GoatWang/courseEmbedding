daniel daylewis movie arrives in  by sean k cureton   comments  shares shareon facebook tweet share email share share pin it share comment acclaimed american filmmaker paul thomas anderson has been making sizable waves in the larger entertainment industry for some twenty years now heralded for his early work on such films as boogie nights from  and magnolia from  the critic’s darling writerdirector has been the center of plenty of attention over the years though his collaboration with oscarwinning actor daniel daylewis lincoln in his  feature there will be blood is perhaps his most well known work to date securing daylewis an oscar for best actor at the time of initial release there will be blood has since proven to be an enduring monument to contemporary filmmaking mastery on that note word has been going around for a while now that anderson and daylewis are hard at work on a new feature film production together – one about the world of the london fashion scene in the s as luck would have it the movie is slated to arrive in theaters very soon according to deadline the new anderson and daylewis motion picture has been jointly picked up by universal pictures and focus features after a heated competition with fox searchlight pictures focus will finance the film at a budget of  million with production scheduled to start early next year ahead of a theatrical release date sometime in late  read awards season focus will handle domestic distribution while universal sees to its international release fans of anderson and lewis will no doubt be happy to hear that there is such fervent and renewed interest in a new movie from the acclaimed american director especially considering the semipolarizing reception received by his last film inherent vice by general audiences in  then again the inclusion of returning collaborator daylewis in front of the camera is a likely reason as to why a number of major production studios might have shown a bit more interest in anderson’s latest original script while an official title and synopsis for the new movie are still forthcoming potential moviegoers likely have a lot to look forward to when the film finally sees theatrical release late next year daylewis has proved to be a more than suitable subject for anderson in the past and with any luck their s london fashion drama will be another successful endeavor for the two longtime film industry movers and shakers screen rant will bring you more information on the latest paul thomas anderson film including its official title as it becomes available source

leader set a toxic tone great colleges to work for presidential pay your daily briefing the chronicle review when truth becomes a commodity the chronicle review when truth becomes a commodity by daniel t rodgers january   posttruth carries a catchy advertisingagency ring and that may be exactly what is wrong with it and with our times we do not live in an era stripped of truths we live to the contrary in a politicalcultural moment saturated with competing claims on truth each insisting on its veracity we have contrived to construct an open marketplace of truths and it is not a happy state if there can be said to be an era in recent american history when the essence of truth was under critical scrutiny it was the generation after  in both popular and academic culture that was when the belief that truth lay in a sphere of certainty independent of truth’s inquirers began to fragment social scientists learned to grow much more selfcritical about their methods anthropologists realized that they could not write themselves out of their ethnographies historians learned that archives contained fictions as well as facts paradigms in thomas kuhn’s phrase shaped the very worlds of assumption in which natural scientists worked none of truth’s seekers it was increasingly realized could wholly escape the perspectives and experiences they carried with them what seemed natural was as often as not not natural at all but a product of culture and unspoken assumption the posttruth issue posttruth—adjective relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief so says oxford dictionaries announcing their  word of the year if we really have entered a posttruth era as so many have written what does that mean for the scholar and the student for the citizen and the state in our special issue we wrestle with these and other urgent questions our graduates are rubes knownothing nation fighting fake premium the plots against america premium facebook and falsehood google and the misinformed public don’t truth me and i won’t truth you kurt vonnegut wrote as that era began but although the moment for which kuhn richard rorty stanley fish and the bestseller proclamation i’m ok you’re ok spoke is easy to caricature as a fit of mere relativism that selfcriticism brought enormous gains as well the epistemological anarchists of the era never formed a very large number for most of those who tried to think through the politics and epistemology of a world beyond certainties truths were not dead truths needed to be argued out they took shape in discourse debate and dialogue they were provisional plural subject to amendment to new standpoints critiques and reexamination truthseeking demanded doubt demanded the ability to entertain more than one hypothesis demanded patience postpositivist postideological truths were formed in the act of selfcritical inquiry whether in the laboratory social fieldwork or the humanities seminar teachers taught students to search for them that sense of truth as the product of selfcritical search and dialogue does not characterize the moment we live in now the culturalpolitical air is filled with competing truth claims shouted angrily and with barely a shred of doubt is global warming real whatever the preponderance of scientific opinion might be has globalization fatally eroded the inner core of the us economy is racism over some of what fills the air — more thickly and noxiously than any democracy can ultimately stand — is lying but lying is very old in democratic politics public figures lie for reasons of state think bay of pigs they lie to protect their political base think watergate they lie because they inhabit a world in which postures and exaggerations have instrumental value think joseph mccarthy tabloid newspapers long made their fortunes by living just over the line of truthtelling halftruths mobilize political crowds whether they be through pictures of money changers swarming through the temples or communists lurking under every bed conspiracy thinking is very old in democratic politics as well cold war culture was saturated with conspiratorial hypotheses both anticatholicism and antisemitism thrived on nightmares of elaborate subversive underground connections the american revolution’s success hinged on the patriots’ growing sense that they were threatened not merely by this or that tax or regulation but by a fullblown conspiracy as the south carolina constitution’s drafters put it in  to reduce them from the rank of freemen to a state of the most abject slavery that sense of truth as the product of selfcritical search and dialogue does not characterize the moment we live in now part of what is different about our current moment is the speed and distance across which competing truth claims can now be broadcast the livingroom gatherings of john birch society locals in the s like the exaggerated facts and conspiracies hatched in a neighborhood bar were limited in their ability to gather up a critical mass of believers the internet and smartphones have profoundly altered that facts generated anywhere on the planet can be consumed virtually anywhere else and then forwarded still further almost without limit this is not the benign more tightly integrated world that many technovisionaries of the s imagined a technology that might have extended the field of dialogue that might have brought distant cultures and persons into closer understanding has contributed unexpectedly to their accelerated fragmentation years ago benedict anderson wrote of the newspaper as an important technology of nationalist solidarity the high politics of the nation the sports news of the day the freakish local weather all found places in its columns a reader’s social imagination was without any conscious intention broadened to encompass them all the very overload of information in our modern environment has helped to produce the opposite effect because there are vastly more sources of fact than anyone can survey one goes to the information sites one knows and trusts the ones that cut through the general noise to get to the truth of the matter audiences and the facts they share are siloed it is the paradox of a radically more tightly interconnected world that it tends to create clumps of information users communities of bonded certainties that are much more widely diffused geographically and yet much more tightly knitted ideationally but no technology is in itself determinative what characterizes our modern technosystem is not simply the conditions of information superfluity it inhabits but that it is still more important a market this is true across much of our contemporary scene the widely reported success of a computerscience student in the distant republic of georgia in churning forward faked and politically slanted us election news for profit is a particularly vivid example of the global market in eyecatching facts that we have unwittingly created ads crawl through every news flash still more of the modern market in truths is driven not by revenue streams but by individual desires clicks are its currency they carry everyone’s wants they cut through the information overload to return just the facts one is looking for all wants in this sense are satisfied the reorganization of society and the social imagination along market lines which has accelerated so rapidly reaches a kind of culmination but in this reconstitution of truths as market commodities the invisible hand working to sort things out is nowhere to be found there is no dialogue there is no discourse there is no weighing of competing hypotheses truths slide past one another without contact points headed for their designated purchasers the very idea of politics as an act of deliberation by which people with inevitably different desires and starting positions must work something out must find their way to a destination that none may have imagined before is devalued in the process we click on truths in the process we instantiate the figure who now commands so much of the imagination of the contemporary social sciences the choosing self but where truths are utterly free to be individually chosen where the processes of inquiry are marginalized the social disintegrates so does truth walking our way back from this condition will not be as easy as simply calling out lying when we find it it will not be accomplished by fighting out the truth in the comments sections where the exaggerated and polarized responses fired back may not even be generated by human actors at all the economists’ answer to imperfectly functioning markets is to devise means to increase their transparency in another clamorous moment a century ago public and private institution builders constructed a powerful set of means to cut through the noise of claims for shoddy and bettermade goods real and useless medical elixirs or fraudulent and bettergrounded investment possibilities independent rating agencies university research laboratories and public statistics agencies were invented to provide a common set of measures and assessments potentially they and their modern counterparts could still stream their findings into every household and conversation but when the credibility of university elites and government data are under severe challenge as just another biased set of facts in a marketplace of data their ability to bring clarity into the open market in truths is crippled who will judge exaggerated and invented news when every umpire must fight for standing in the refereeing market finding our way back to the notion of truth as the result of a public process of search and debate and deliberation will not be easy it will take another round of market regulation and institutionbuilding it will take a rebirth of the kind of countermarket imagination that keeps an institution like wikipedia standing amid the truthaspreference clamor around it it will take rededication to the goal of bringing the tools of inquiry research and collaborative discussion into every level of education from elementaryschool classrooms to graduatestudent laboratories and seminars it will take patient and humble experts less eager themselves for a marketable sound bite above all it will require a renewed commitment to truth’s complexity and the processes by which one searches for it as long as we can click on the truths we want as long as truth is imagined as a desire satisfied in a politically and commercially saturated market we will have a superabundance of facts that people hold as true everyone will get what he wants and the public — and its trust in truth — will fall apart daniel t rodgers is an emeritus professor of history at princeton university his book age of fracture harvard university
