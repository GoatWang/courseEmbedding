program back to top crowdfunding rewards crowdfunding campaign rewards are some of the most important aspects of your campaign because they bring in the money but even beyond that they solidify the bond between the campaign and the backers and keep them emotionally invested in your idea it’s no secret that the more involved people feel in a project the more likely they are to care about it create something personal that only backers will receive to make the rewards feel exclusive to the crowdfunding community give them a chance to be part of the inception of your idea when your idea gains traction backers will feel proud that they contributed to it and you’ll gain both an advocate and someone who can bring more supporters too rewards are super powerful but you’ve got to be careful with how you handle them too if your rewards aren’t appealing readers will lose attention but if you have rewards that are too expensive or if you overwhelm them with too many even if they’re all interesting you’ll likely lose your audience so how do you come up with effective profitable and affordable rewards the big secret just put yourself in their shoes remember that they’re receiving and choosing the rewards not you you’ve got to consider that the crowd isn’t a group of angel investors nor is it your family it’s just someone with a little bit of money to burn who’s browsing through the internet looking to spend it on something cool not break their bank what do you think they do outside looking at your campaign try to use that as a guide for their interests and for what else they might enjoy seeing so if you can give them something compelling and interesting to spend it on you’ve probably got yourself a backer be careful when it comes to physical rewards like tshirts the cost can add up pretty quickly rewards don’t have to be tangible they can be as simple as a social media shoutout or thank you card if you do choose to use physical rewards ensure that you’ve done all the necessary calculations to make sure you’ve put them at the right price point also going back to researching your audience make sure that whatever swag you create is something you know your backers will use something more personal to them based on their interests they’ll like it more they’ll use it more and they’ll be more proud of their contribution if your idea is a tangible product offering a prototype or a presale of your product is obviously a great idea because you should already have all the resources necessary to produce thoseno outsourcing necessary you shouldn’t end up in the red from selling your own product and you’ll gain some valuable publicity and feedback once people are using it in terms of crowdfunding rewards are the most important part of a crowdfunding campaign they have the power to take your campaign from  to  use them wisely integrated crowdfunding llc  business services schull formdscom  sec filings of fundraisings and investments in hedge funds

contact us article centerrtrifbusiness formationrtrifstarting a businessrtrifcrowdfunding  crowdfunding  by bilal kaiser freelance writer digital marketing crowdfunding  by bilal kaiser august  at its core the internet has created centralized communities of likeminded individuals who bond over mutual interests these interests can be general or very specific in their scope—thats all good news for a new era of risktakers who want their pet projects to finally see the light of day what follows is an introduction to the ins and outs of this brave new world crowdfunding what it is it used to be if you wanted to get money to make your creative entrepreneurial or startup idea a reality you had to find investors set up lots of meetings file the proper paperwork and go through lengthy and costly processes before ever earning a dollar and all of that was before you put in the countless hours of hard work to ensure your projects success today through the magic of the internet social media has changed the way projects are funded and in turn successfully completed its called crowdfunding and it may be the ideal solution for that indie movie you always wanted to make similar to the concept of crowdsourcing where organizations divvy up a project and components are completed by a group of people—some of whom may never meet—crowdfunding pulls together funds by those believing in the power of a particular project creative funding kickstarter one very popular platform that allows creative individuals and innovative groups to tap into the internet for funding is kickstarter the companys premise is simple creative ideas get posted on the site with a set goal for funds and anyone can contribute to the project via credit card once the goal is reached the site charges a  percent processing fee kickstarter has been used to fund student art projects indie films music festivals and even public radio stories in addition to giving users a way to collect funds the site makes it easy for visitors to discover interesting projects they might want to support these projects can range from a highend custom iphone dock idea to the dramaticmusical retelling of franz kafkas famous short story the metamorphosis” the former recently surpassed its budget goal of  on kickstarter—and made more than a million in revenue projects in kickstarter are created on an allornothing basis meaning if a project reaches  percent of its budget goal supporters credit cards are billed simultaneously if a project doesnt reach its budget goal no ones credit card is billed supporters arent investing in the true sense of the word since no one receives a return on their money however project creators do offer rewards to their supporters as a way of thanking them some examples of this includes copies of the project being made available to the supporter limited editions of the project and a custom experience related to the project itself anything funding indiegogo another crowdfunding platform is indiegogo while kickstarter is limited to creative projects indiegogo allows anyone to collect money for anything—and we mean anything from prefunding for a photography book to medical bills for a sick relative indiegogo opens its site to any and all causes processing fees for successful projects are similar to kickstarter—around  percent there are other similar sites available to interested parties as well but kickstarter and indiegogo offer not only a reputable platform and large network of visitors theyre also incredibly easy to use both sites offer stepbystep instructions and boast a wide array of concepts and projects available for investment the internet revolution continues but unlike ever before commerce and creativity are connecting on a whole other level if youre ready to see what the internet can do for you give these sites a try and see what happens maybe that llc youve always dreamed of owning and operating is now one step closer to reality
