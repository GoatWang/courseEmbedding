women  a new organic pad and tampon subscription service helps women go green and save money by kate l harrison kate l harrison is a bestselling author founder and entrepreneur who built and sold the leading green wedding brand in the country she has a jd in environmental law from pace and a masters in environmental management from yale today harrison is a startup marketing consultant who specializes in helping small scrappy companies and nonprofits connect with ecoconscious consumers while increasing their bottom lines katelharrison author and entrepreneurkatelharrison  comments tampon tribe is changing the way women buy tampons and pads credit getty images you probably have heard of the dollar shave club but did you know there is something similar for feminine hygiene products it turns out that the average woman uses  tampons in her lifetime adding up to  worth of feminine hygiene products this is one reason why new york city now offers free menstrual products in all public schools shelters and jails and has carved out a sales tax exemption for tampons for everyone tampons are expensive and not exactly optional but even these tampons are manufactured with bleaches and other toxic chemicals and the average box of organic tampons retails for about twice what conventionally produced tampons sell for  putting them out of reach for many enter tampon tribe the  per month  organic tampon and pad subscription service it is disrupting this established industry by providing affordable feminine hygiene products that are toxin free plastic free and completely compostable the products according to founder jennifer eden cost considerably less than anything similar and offer far superior quality eden insists hers is not a company but in fact an energetic social impact project as a result the companys commitment to social good is impressive each purchase supports homeless women by providing a daily tampon pack for those in need and a portion of each sale goes to girls inc a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping girls grow up strong smart and bold the company is also committed to employing exfelons and the homeless the following is an excerpt of edens interview with inccom kate l harrison how did you get the idea for your company what was the need and how did you get to this solution jennifer eden i came across the idea from both a personal health and a convenience business point of view first of all every woman in the world runs out of tampons each month even if youve had your period since you were  it just happens you run out and then youre rushing to the store under stress or youre getting your partner to rush to the store to buy you tampons my first idea was to simply create the dollar shave club for tampons tampons are an essential item for  of women in the us i thought wouldnt it be great if they just arrived at my front door every month the more reading i did the more i realized there were other issues to be addressed like toxic shock syndrome and environmental impact our search for materials changed as we segued over to the organic components especially certified organic cotton i thought wouldnt it be great if we could do this with organic products and still keep the price low enough were still looking at a  profit margin relative to our costs and thats only at low purchasing levels secondly health reasons became important to us on a personal level i went through a health situation myself many of my friends had been touched in some way by cancer which does actually hit one in two people in the world we made a commitment to organic products as we became more concerned  and more conscious  about what we were putting into our body or allowing to touch our skin this focus on health helped us move forward in our business then i thought how can we create a business that is more inclusive i wanted to create a great ecosphere of people who want to get involved with our charitable endeavors in this way i hoped to create this great tribe of people who want to give back  and we have were quite different from anyone else in the market in that aspect as well people want to get on board become a part of tampon tribe they want to wear the tshirt they want people to talk about tampons they dont want this common feminine product to be a taboo anymore its something we should have out in the open more to reduce selfconsciousness and body shaming harrison how are you funded eden​ we are currently doing an equity crowdfunding raise on wefunder wefundercomtampontribe tampon tribe is a community as well as a very viable business it empowers women and adds to the organic feminine hygiene market in a significant way we wanted to enable investment opportunities for both accredited and nonaccredited investors so we decided to go with crowdfunding its changing the landscape of investment harrison how does it work eden​ think dollar shave club for  certified organic cotton tampons and pads that are also plasticfree and completely biodegradable and compostable selections are customizable new customers sign up for a subscription make their selection from either  sizes of tampons in any tampon box configuration or opt for pads daynight first month orders arrive in a cute burlap bag designed to be original and attractive monthly refills arrive in recycled paper for every month ordered we give a period pack to a homeless woman  tampons  pads a feminine wipe and biodegradable waste bag a user account is created where tribe members can adjustpauseadd to their monthly order harrison whats in it for consumers eden​ everything most importantly our tribe members have access to organic feminine hygiene products that are usually expensive and hard to find or not available at all we believe that every woman has the right to choose organic products for her body regardless of her income so our monthly cost of  includes delivery to your door we are also passionate about completely eliminating plastics from feminine hygiene products our applicators are a thin smooth cardboard tube the tampons are wrapped in recycled paper pads are wrapped in a starchfilm and the adhesive is a biopolymer we will also be incorporating a strong socialimpact employment mission that includes adults in retraining programs older workers vets and intellectuallychallenged adults we know that we can really make a significant contribution to our society and that our company will be strong and complete with a diverse team harrison how is it going pontes our first month went great with presales reaching almost  which we are really excited about we are also on track to meet our delivery schedule we are now crowdfunding our friends and family equity round on wefunder we hit our first target in our first week and have moved up now to tier  harrison what has been your biggest challenge eden​ balancing everything that needs to be done in a bootstrap startup from meeting investors to building our brand attending events growing corporate sales and relations to fundraising  its a fastpaced exciting time harrison any early lessons for other founders eden listen closely to people in your target market  and segue when needed our presale push saw us adjust our product mix to meet demand and also incorporate a more immediate giveback so we can have a greater impact on the ground both of these moves were strategic decisions that greatly enhanced what tampontribe can now offer the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom

does tampon tribe do tampon tribe is an online monthly subscription service for  certified organic cotton tampons theyre toxic free plastic free and completely compostable we came into being to fill the very big void in the market that currently exists in terms of organic feminine hygiene i started looking for organic products myself and realized that theyre really hard to find and are extremely expensive our mission is to disrupt the market and provide affordable access to organic feminine hygiene for women everywhere in southern california we can go to whole foods if we have the money and buy a couple of the options they have there though they are limited many people don’t live near a whole foods or have  to  a month to spend on an organic product tell us about your tampons and what makes them different our product is  organic cotton it has a woven core so it doesn’t contain glues no dyes no toxins no plastics in addition to our mission of having womens bodies be as healthy and as toxicfree as possible were also concerned about the environment most women use plastic applicators on a tampon they’ll use about  tampons in their lifetime multiply it by the millions of women in the us that use regular tampons and thats a lot of plastic going into our waterways and our landfills plastic has a huge environmental impact we use a smooth thin cardboard applicator that is completely compostable our packaging is made with recycled paper we dont use boxes in our packaging when you subscribe to tampon tribe your first order arrives in a burlap bag designed to look nice and fit inside your bathroom cabinet or on the shelf then every month you get a refill pack in a recycled paper bag you can select your combination online depending on what size tampon you need and what your flow is you let us know ahead of time what you need for that months delivery will be and thats what we send out for you its completely customizable and affordable our monthly subscription is  including shipping and includes  tampons if youre going to a cvs a comparable but nonorganic product would be about the same price  to  can you take us back to the beginning how did you get started i came across the idea from both a personal health and a convenient business point of view first of all every woman in the world runs out of tampons every month even if youve had your period since you were  it just happens you run out and youre always rushing to the store or youre getting your partner to rush to the store to buy you tampons my first idea was to create the dollar shave club of tampons tampons are an essential item for  of women in the us i thought “wouldnt it be great if you just arrived at my front door every month”the more reading i did the more i realized and came to find out about toxic shock syndrome and about the environmental impact our search changed a little bit and segued over to the organic and the certified organic cotton i thought wouldnt it be great if we could do this with organic products and still keep the price low were still looking at a  profit margin on our costs and thats only at low purchasing levels secondly health reasons came into it from a personal level i went through a health situation myself as i started to speak to more and more of my friends who had been touched in some way by normally cancer which does actually hit one in two people in this world we start then looking more toward organic products and being a lot more conscious about what we put into our body or touches our skin those two things combined to move forward with the business then i thought how can we create a business that is more inclusive a business that creates this great ecosphere of people people who want to get involved with our charitable aspects and get involved with our giving back and create this great tribe were quite different from anyone else on the market in that aspect as well people want to get on board and just be part of tampon tribe they want to wear the tshirt they want people to talk about tampons they dont want this to be a taboo anymore its a product that pretty much everyone either buys or buys for someone else or knows someone who needs it its something we should have out a bit more in the open who are your customers our product resonates with different consumers some people just want the convenience some people are really keen on the organic aspect and some people want the toxic free environmental aspect of it we find it also resonates really well with men anyone who is a dad as soon as you talk about the toxins they want to sign up their daughters and their wives and their sisters and everything we’re talking about a  billion global expected to grow to  billion in less than ten years most women spend between  to  a month on their feminine hygiene products some more when you look at the average a cheap bag of tampax is still about  or  then you buy some pads to go with it or something like that for organic you go to whole foods there are a couple of options but limited in terms of their size and they dont have applicators they can range from  up who are your competitors online there are about four companies who are our competitors the main competitor is a company called my lola they do cotton tampons and theyve got plastic applicators and plastic packaging they dont have that tribe mentality its just a product they’re a little more expensive as well there are a couple of other organic cotton products but theyre very expensive and they dont deliver monthly ours is a  price point theirs is about    and then theyre very heavily packaged theyre targeting the executive market which of course is our market as well but we want to target everybody we dont need someone that needs to spend  a month on their feminine hygiene we come in at an affordable level and we tick all the boxes when it comes to organic toxic free and of course we want people to feel like they want to be part of tampon tribe its like dollar shave club people want to be part of a club how do you differentiate from the competitors were coming into the market with a wider range of product we dont just do tampons were also doing pads as i found out a lot of people dont use tampons so were also coming up with a range of feminine hygiene which will be really exciting because there are no subscription feminine hygiene pads on the market whatsoeverwe’re all about protecting our bodies and the environment and being convenient as well like dollar shave club you get your little razors in a small bag and you use them ours is the same you get a refill each month rather than getting brand new packaging every month and you get to use your original packaging thats a differentiatorwe also come under other subscription prices my lola is  a month for their basic product which is not organic kali box is about  what do you understand that your competitors don’t get a lot of tampons are made with a range of different materials like a synthetic rayon they contain chlorine bleach chlorine has dioxin which has been directly linked to cervical cancer they have perfumes and dyes in them and the cotton has not been grown in an organic way which means that the gmos or any of the fertilizers in the soil come into your body toxic shock is a real thing we like to do a little test if you put the tampons inside water ours is cotton so it just absorbs the liquid and you can squeeze it out not that you would do this with a tampon none of the fibers come off with a more generic tampon the fibers actually break off they stay in the womans body if they have a toxin in it they may cause toxic shock ive met a few people that have reached out to me over the course of the last few months asking or letting me know their story where they had gotten toxic shock from tampons one of them is a model from venice and she lost her leg people have had hysterectomies at  we dont like to market the scary side to much because we dont want to scare into purchasing at the same token theres a very real health risk in putting products in or on your body that has chemicals and toxins why is the subscription model right for tampons and other feminine hygiene products the subscription model has been proven with dollar shave club and the one billion dollar buyout very recently unilever just bought seventh generation thats showing a shift and a recognition of organic cleaning products and household products its a big recognition that larger companies are starting to acquire these more grassroots organic green companies weve received a lot of positive feedback about the fact that our product is organic compostable and without plastic a lot of people dont know about the other subscription services yet its all too new were going to come in with a better product with better prices and with a better strategy to be able to dominate that sector tell us about your production process were producing out of europe our manufacturing partner is iceacertified which means ethically produced and organic every single part of the production process has to meet really strict european standards the standards in europe are a lot higher that the standards in america in terms of ethics it means that they cant overuse water in the process they cant put any chemicals or fertilizers on the product they have a quick turnaround as well how do you acquire customers at the moment were in prelaunch weve managed to build up all of our mailing lists and all of our followers by mainly social media this is where you find the people who are passionate about health fitness organics the environment we’ve reached out to the influencers in the health and fitness industry the womens business industry the womens empowerment groups weve got quite a few of them on board that are very happy to support us people are very keen to get behind us because of all the different aspects and the boxes that we tick in terms of a breakdown of customer acquisition were relying more on viral marketing influencers and social media most of our customers are online and using social media theyre very active on facebook and instagram weve also been approached by quite a few of these gift box services we can partner with them by putting our products in their monthly gift boxes what ideas do you have for growth in the next  months  months at the moment were working with a  margin but we know we can get that higher into the   as soon as our units go up past  the other market were going to tackle are large corporate health organizations for example equinox is a gym they have tampons in all of their bathrooms across america and we have just partnered with yoga works this not only increases our sales but increases our marketing outreach because people will see tampon tribe everywhere and associate that with yoga with the equinox with hour fitness with anything to do with health then youve got the corporate market most companies now are starting to put feminine hygiene in the bathroom for women we want to make sure that tampon tribe is there i think thats another area in term of business that were going into that our competitors dont look at why will you win first and foremost were creating a little bit more than just a business we keep people involved at every level a lot of people want to support the green individual smaller business they dont want to support proctor and gamble thats our market were looking at one to five percent of the entire market who have already converted to the organic sphere we also have a social outreach side weve just partnered with girls inc as our first charitable partner we want to be able to help change peoples lives by partnering with charities who change young girls and boys lives for the better we’ve also been working these past few months on our period pack project where we get feminine hygiene products to women on our streetsin terms of our employment strategy we are looking at partnering with organizations in la such as chrysalis who do retraining programs we’re also focusing on hiring veterans who are often underutilized special needs adults will also help make our team completewe have a holistic view of everything we do were completely transparent and when it comes to people who are buying and purchasing in this sector thats important to them they buy ethically what’s been your largest challenge so far why are you raising money now my biggest concern is having enough inventory and thats why were looking for funding we know the demand can grow quickly we know that once its out there and in the sorority with young women we can explode but we don’t want to have  orders and no inventory to fulfill them we’re going to use this fundraise to bolster our production and scale read all answers view all questions ask a question  startups have raised  on wefunder wefunder supports three different federal laws that allow
