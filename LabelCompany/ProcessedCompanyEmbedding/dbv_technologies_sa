from the global offering of approximately  € million based on the public offering price of  per ads in the us offering and € per ordinary share in the french registered private placement after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional ordinary shares and adss if the underwriters exercise in full their options to purchase additional ordinary shares and adss in the us offering and additional ordinary shares in the french registered private placement we estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the global offering of approximately  € million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us the principal purposes of the global offering are to increase our financial flexibility create a public market for our securities in the united states and facilitate our access to the public equity markets we currently expect to use the net proceeds from the global offering as follows  approximately  million to advance the development of our viaskin peanut and viaskin milk product candidates  approximately  million to fund our earlier stage development activities including our development programs in eosinophilic esophagitis and pertusiss boost vaccine  approximately  million to buildout our clinical and commercial infrastructure in the united states and  approximately  million to support our growth globally by expanding general administrative and operational functions in our headquarters in france we expect to use the remainder of any net proceeds from the global offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to inlicense acquire or invest in complementary technologies products or assets however we have no current plan commitments or obligations to do so based on our current operation plans and assumptions we expect that the net proceeds from the global offering combined with our current operating capital will be sufficient to support the advancement of our viaskin peanut product candidate through the completion of our planned phase iii clinical trial and pending the results of this trial the submission of a bla for this product candidate as well as the advancement of our viaskin milk product candidate through the end of our planned phase ii clinical trial for this product candidate however there can be no assurance that these expectations will be correct we currently have no specific plans as to how the net proceeds from the global offering will be allocated beyond the uses specified above and therefore management will retain discretion to allocate the remainder of the net proceeds of the global offering among these uses this expected use of the net proceeds from the global offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions as of the date of this prospectus we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the global offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the progress of our development efforts the status of and results from preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from the global offering pending our use of the net proceeds from the global offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments including shortterm investmentgrade interestbearing instruments the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments significant competitive factors in our industry include product efficacy and safety quality and breadth of an organization’s technology skill of an organization’s employees and its ability to recruit and retain key employees timing and scope of regulatory approvals government reimbursement rates for and the average selling price of products the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity manufacturing costs intellectual property and patent rights and their protection and sales and marketing capabilities we cannot assure you that any of our products that we successfully develop will be clinically superior or scientifically preferable to products developed or introduced by our competitors our competitors may also succeed in obtaining fda or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates more rapidly than we are able to do which could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage or deny us marketing exclusivity rights market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors including  potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies or tests  the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products  the effectiveness of sales marketing and distribution capabilities and  the scope of any approval provided by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities although we believe our product candidates possess attractive attributes we cannot assure you that our product candidates will achieve regulatory or market acceptance or that we will be able to compete effectively in the biopharmaceutical drug markets if our product candidates fail to gain regulatory approvals and acceptance in their intended markets we may not generate meaningful revenues or achieve profitability there are numerous competitors on the market for the therapeutic treatment of allergies numerous structures pharmaceutical laboratories biotechnology companies institutions universities and other research entities are actively involved in the discovery research development and marketing of therapeutic responses to treat allergies many of our competitors have greater resources and experience in terms of clinical development management manufacturing marketing and research than us in the case of food allergies we are aware of several academic studies that are currently being conducted in major centers and hospitals worldwide these studies are evaluating sublingual subcutaneous intranasal or other forms of desensitization or products using synthetic allergens denatured allergens or combinations of medicines or methods or medicines using traditional methods such as chinese herbs we are not aware of any pharmaceutical development in conjunction with these academic efforts at this time we expect studies combining other methods of immunotherapy such as oit with antiige treatments will be conducted these types of coadministrations may significantly improve the safety of specific immunotherapies administered orally or subcutaneously and may become significant competitors with our products to our knowledge other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are also seeking to develop food allergy treatments although many are in the discovery or preclinical stages for example allergen research corporation is currently evaluating in phase ii clinical trials a formulation of peanut flour for oral administration intended for oral desensitization we are aware of other companies that are working on recombinant peanut proteins capable of initiating an attenuated immune response of using subcutaneous administration we are also aware that sanofi sa has entered into licensing agreements of discovery platforms in selected food allergies notably with immune design corp and selecta biosciences inc and may pose a competitive risk to our products in the future company description we are a clinicalstage specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on changing the field of immunotherapy by developing a novel technology platform called viaskin our therapeutic approach is based on epicutaneous immunotherapy or epit our proprietary method of delivering biologically active compounds to the immune system through intact skin using viaskin we have generated significant data demonstrating that viaskin’s mechanism of action is novel and differentiated as it targets specific antigenpresenting immune cells in the skin called langerhans cells that capture the antigen and migrate to the lymph node in order to activate the immune system without passage of the antigen into the bloodstream we are advancing this unique technology to treat patients including infants and children suffering from severe food allergies for whom safety is paramount since the introduction of the offending allergen into their bloodstream can cause severe or lifethreatening allergic reactions such an anaphylactic shock our proprietary platform is based on our epicutaneous viaskin patch we have designed and developed this technology internally for which we have scalable manufacturing capabilities viaskin is an electrostatic patch which offers a convenient selfadministered noninvasive immunotherapy to patients once applied on intact skin viaskin forms a condensation chamber which hydrates the skin and solubilizes the antigen allowing it to penetrate the epidermis where it is captured by langerhans cells based on numerous scientific publications and our own research we believe this unique mechanism of action is safe and that it generates a strong immune response that results in tolerance towards the allergen our epicutaneous immunotherapy method allows us to address severe food allergies as well as unmet medical needs in other immunotherapy indications our lead product candidate viaskin peanut has obtained fast track designation from the us food and drug administration or fda which is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that are intended to treat a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition in september  we announced topline results for our vipes  vi askin p eanut’s e fficacy and s afety phase iib clinical trial of viaskin peanut in peanut allergic patients pending consultation with the fda we plan to initiate our phase iii clinical trial in the first quarter of  our second product candidate viaskin milk is being developed for cow’s milk protein allergy or cmpa in the pediatric patient population in the second half of  we intend to initiate a subject multicenter doubleblind placebocontrolled randomized phase iii safety and efficacy clinical trial of repeated doses of viaskin milk in patients with immunoglobulin e or ige mediated cmpa which we refer to as miles milk delivered epicutaneously study we have further used our viaskin technology platform to advance other innovative product development programs to address additional opportunities in immunology we currently have one preclinical product candidate as a result of these product development programs our product candidate for house dust mite allergy our other earlier stage product development programs include eosinophilic esophagitis pertusiss boost vaccine and birch pollen allergy none of which have resulted in a product candidate to date we are also exploring earlier stage opportunities in respiratory syncytial virus vaccine refractory hemophilia a crohn’s disease and type i diabetes we intend to commercialize our food allergy product candidates by ourselves in the united states and certain european countries in other geographies and indications outside food allergies we will explore selective partnerships with parties who have relevant clinical and commercial expertise in order to maximize shareholder value  we
