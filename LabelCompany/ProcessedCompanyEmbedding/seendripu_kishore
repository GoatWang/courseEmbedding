like to turn the conference over to your host mr gideon massey investor relations specialist thank you you may begin gideon massey thank you operator good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on todays conference call to discuss maxlinears fourth quarter  financial results and the announcement of its definite agreement acquire marvells ghn business todays call is being hosted by dr kishore seendripu ceo and adam spice cfo during the course of todays conference call we will discuss our financial performance review our business activities for the fourth quarter and the pending acquisition of marvells ghn business after our prepared comments we will take questions our comments today will include various forwardlooking statements within the meaning of applicable security laws including without limitation statements relating to our current projections forecast and expectations with respect to first quarter  revenue and revenue contribution from key product markets gross profit percentage and operating expenses on a gaap and nongaap basis the potential impacts on our business of recent acquisitions and the acquisitions we may pursue in the future and our current views regarding opportunities and trends in our market including our current views of potential for growth in each of our target markets these projections expectations and other forwardlooking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from currently forecasted results risks potentially affecting these statements and our business generally include substantial competition in particular from increasingly large players as our industry consolidates potential declines in average selling prices and factors that could adversely affect our operating expenses such as litigation asset impairment or restructuring in addition our target markets including target markets we may pursue through future acquisitions including our pending acquisition of marvells ghn business may not grow in the manner or at the rates we currently expect we face risks associated with consolidation trends in our operator markets and we face integration risks associated with acquisitions for a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties potentially affecting the forwardlooking statements we make today in our business generally we encourage investors to review the sections caption risk factors in our previously filed quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   and our annual report on form q for the yearended december   which we expect to file shortly with the sec any forwardlooking statements are made as of today and maxlinear does not currently intend and has no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements the fourth quarter  earnings release is available on the investor relations section of our website at maxlinearcom in addition we report certain historical financial metrics including gross margins operating expenses net income or loss and net income or loss per share on both gaap and nongaap basis our nongaap presentation excludes certain expense items as discussed in detail in the press release available on our website the press release available on our website also includes a reconciliation of our gaap and nongaap presentations which we encourage investors to review it is not our intent that the nongaap financial measures discussed today replace the presentation of maxlinear gaap financial results we are providing this information to enable investors to perform more meaningful comparison of operating results and more clearly highlight the results of core ongoing operations in a manner similar to managements analysis of our business we do not provide a reconciliation for forwardlooking nongaap gross margin and operating expense guidance which excludes estimates for stockbased compensation expense bonus accruals acquisitionrelated expenses and restructuring charges each of these expense items is explained in greater detail in the press release the timing and amounts of these future expenses which we would need to provide a reconciliation of nongaap margin and operating expense guidance are inherently unpredictable or outside our control to predict accordingly we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of forwardlooking nongaap estimates without unreasonable effort material changes to any of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future gaap results lastly this call is being webcast and a replay will be available for two weeks and now let me turn the call over to kishore seendripu ceo of maxlinear kishore seendripu thank you gideon and good afternoon everyone thank you all for joining us today before delving into the financial results we are excited to report q  revenues of  million which brings to close a very successful  in  we not only realized a record revenue of  million and strong cash flow generation from operations of  million but we also made solid progress towards our strategic objective of expanding and diversifying our served addressable market we achieved this goal by expanding our cmos analog and mixedsignal product footprint in our existing broadband operative platforms and by successfully penetrating the large and growing optical and wireless infrastructure markets today’s announcement of our acquisition of marvells ghn business is consistent with the stated strategic objective the ghn acquisition further expands the size and diversity of our multi gigabit access and connectivity footprint to include large telcos deploying xdsl gfast and fiber broadband data delivery technologies for the home  will prove to be an exciting year for us as multiyear product development will sample too or ramp to mass production at key tier  customers in broadband optical and wireless infrastructure markets these product innovations include our next generation multigigabit moca  soc our  nanometer cmos  gigahertz to  gigahertz single chip microwave wireless backhaul rf transceivers and an expanded line up of  gigabaud  gigabaud and  gigabaud limiting and linear tias and laser drivers for the long haul metro and datacenter markets in second half  we will sample our first cable infrastructure soc solution which addresses the emerging full duplex docsis x headend and fiber node applications it should in the future enable cable msos to deliver upto  gigabit data services to the home over the existing hybrid fibercoaxial network our  gigabit per lambda pam high speed fiber interconnect solution supporting  gigabits per second interconnect speeds inside the datacenter is also slated for sampling in the second half in wireless access infrastructure we are making steady progress towards the development of a fully integrated massive mimo rf transceiver solution that addresses the emerging g and g wireless network deployments the foundation of our organic initiatives across infrastructure of broadband access and connectivity markets is our core cmos rfmixed signal communications technology platform the success of our ongoing expansion into optical and wireless infrastructure markets is proof of the scalability of our core cmos technology platform across a range of large and growing communications markets moving on to our q  results our revenue of  million in q  was in line with prior guidance down  sequentially and down  yearoveryear i am extremely pleased with our topline operating margin resilience even as we navigate through the expected wind down certain legacy and tropic products namely satellite analog channels tracking and video socs we are now increasingly optimistic that q  marks the beginning of the resumption of our sequential revenue growth these legacy products currently represent less than  of overall revenue mix more importantly the decline in legacy revenue are being rapidly replace the products with doubledigit sequential revenue growth rates addressing the higher quality cable data gateway high speed optical interconnect and wireless infrastructure markets the improving quality and diversification of our revenue stream is highlighted by our combined optical wireless infrastructure revenues now represent the growing  of overall q revenue taken together q results close out a very successful  with a full year revenue up  at a record  million strong cash generation from operations of about  million gross margin improvements and a proven track record of executing on our strategic goals by a disciplined combination of organic and inorganic growth initiatives now moving to the specifics of our business highlights for the fourth quarter of  operator revenues declined  sequentially and accounted for  of total revenue in the quarter within operator cable data shipments rebounded in particular  and  channel docsis  solutions there were strong demand for cable video as well we also saw the beginnings of a cable docsis  ramp which grew by more than two times sequentially even though it was a small part of our cable data mix the underlying market dynamics supporting the docsis  product cycle are extremely exciting docsis  would be a very meaningful growth driver in second half of  owing to a leadership position in cable data front end and our expanded footprint consisting of companion pgas and moca connectivity solutions satellite digital outdoor units also grew strongly up doubledigits sequentially resulting in a near doubling of  annual revenue related to  the growth in digital outdoor unit was offset by the anticipated decline in legacy analog channels tracking chips our satellite digital outdoor unit products are ramping to full production volume in north america and europe we also have a great pipeline of design wins at major operators in the rest of the world including telephonica bharti and tata sky that are yet to ramp also in q  satellite k gateway rf receiver shipments declined as several tier  european operators digested inventories following a particularly strong q we are really excited to announce the initial shipment of our first organically developed moca soc solution to a large new tier  wireless telco operator in north america our next generation moca  solution which is capable of reaching  gigabits per second data rates is also on track to ramp in the second half of  moca originated as an enabler for whole home pvr and video distribution on coaxial cable in cable and satellite subscriber homes today owing to its high quality of service and robust multigigabit bandwidth delivery capability moca has emerged as a critical high bandwidth coaxial backbone connectivity solution essential to enabling robust wifi coverage throughout the connected home moca technology has also morphed into clink which is a robust and low cost access infrastructure solution for mdus or multidwelling units clink is currently starting to deploy at several cable msos in china todays announcement of the acquisition of marvell’s ghn business for  million in cash further strengthens our wired connectivity product portfolio ghn is truly complementary to moca moca is a broadband connectivity solution with data distribution on coaxial cable while ghn is ideally suited to deliver broadband data robustly over electrical twisted pair and powerline physical media inside the home as a result ghn allows us to expand our connectivity footprint to include telco msos deploying exdsl gfast and fibertohomes with no preinstalled coaxial cable the need for alternative connectivity medians to coaxial cable is especially prevalent outside of north america and parts of europe with addition of ghn we are able to offer oems and broadband operator partners multiple wired connectivity solutions each ideally suited for a particular geography or ecosystem through the ghn acquisition we have secured several strategic tier  telco operator engagements and design wins along with an incredibly capable technology team in valencia spain there have public announcements of adoption of ghn by kd telecom in south korea china telecom reliance in india and other major telcos in europe and north america as our ghn design wins ramp to production we will be in a strong position to crosssell other maxlinear products and expand our target addressable market by another  million broadband subscriber homes moving to our infrastructure and other products revenue was up  of total revenues in the quarter we witness resumption of growth for our high speed fiber interconnect products and realized stronger than expected revenue contributions from our broad common micro semiwireless backhaul access infrastructure asset acquisition respectively for the year our high speed fiber interconnect revenues were at the high end of the  million to  million range that we guided to at the beginning of  as we look forward we are excited about the revenue prospects and are expanding the speed fiber interconnect product portfolio in  maxlinear’s portfolio will transform from a single laser driver product shipping to two major tier  oems in china to a broad suite of laser driver tia solutions shipping into datacenter metro and long haul fiber applications in q we began shipments of two new laser drivers and our first tia product forward by  or gigabit nrz datacenter and for lr telco applications we’ve also diversified our high speed fiber interconnect customer base with shipments to  different customers during the quarter moving to our wireless infrastructure markets our required microwave backhaul business grew strongly sequentially with contributions from a range of tier  and tier  telco wireless oem however we do expect a modest pullback for this business in q primarily due to the strength witnessed in q i would like to know that we are forecasting very strong growth for this business in  we are excited about nearing the initial ramp of our organically develop  to  gigahertz fully integrated cmos rf transceiver at a tier  oem the backhaul rf transceiver frontend seamlessly complement the backhaul microware modem soc we acquired from broadcom this is both consistent with and also validates our strategy of becoming a full platform technology provider in the microwave backhaul market our wireless access business also experience sequential increase in revenue relative to q  as the wireless access market transitions to g and g deployments in order to deliver multi gigabit data speeds over the air the entire wireless network will transform to a massively distributed sdn and nfv network it will be a cloud based remote ratio access network or cram with massive mimo and beam steering active antenna systems distributed antenna systems macro cell base stations and small cells interconnected by wireless backhaul and optical fiber front haul solutions to the network core this will result in an exponential increase in the rf transceiver unit tam we’ll be entering a transformative market of a position of strength in both optical and wireless rf transceiver technologies as we look forward we are excited by our progress towards accelerating the scale and leverage of our product portfolio across both wireless access and backhaul infrastructure platforms we are pleased by the customer channel and technology platform leverage and synergies we’re driving through our wireless and fiber infrastructure acquisitions in the wireless infrastructure space lastly legacy video soc revenues derived from the entropic acquisition declined to  million in the quarter or  of total revenues versus  in the prior quarter as we expected this weakness owe to last time buys in the prior quarter of our cable hddta deployment and satellite ip client devices we expect the legacy video soc business to be at a negligible level of  of our total revenues in  before i turn the call over to adam spice our chief financial officer i would like to reintegrate that we are extremely pleased to have delivered strong fourth quarter and fiscal year  we are pleased with the increasing diversification of our revenue streams across broadband access and wire and wireless infrastructure markets entering  we also feel optimistic about the prospect of resumption of sequential revenue growth starting in q as we navigate through the final phase of our declining entropic legacy businesses we are excited about our product expansion strong customer and end market diversification potential and the sustainability of our core broadband infrastructure technology platform we look forward to sharing more information regarding the progress of our development initiative in the coming months now let me turn the call over to mr adam spice our chief financial officer for a review of the financials and our forward guidance adam spice thank you kishore i’ll first review our q  and full year  results and then briefly discuss our outlook for q  as kishore noted our q was  million consistent with our guidance gaap and nongaap gross margin for the fourth quarter were approximately  and  of revenue respectively at the high end of our prior guidance of  to  for gaap and  to  for nongaap gross margin the delta to the midpoint of our guide is primarily driven by favorable mixed within our operator and infrastructure revenue this compares to gaap and nongaap gross margins of  and  respectively in the third quarter of  and net gaap and nongaap gross margins of  and  respectively in the year ago quarter the delta between gaap and nongaap gross margins in the fourth quarter was primarily acquisition related reflecting the amortization of  million of purchased intangible assets and inventory step up and lesser  of stockbased compensation and stock based bonus accruals q gaap operating expenses were approximately  million  below guidance with the delta primary related to lower prototyping facilities and restructuring expenses partially offset by higher payroll and patent related spending gaap operating expenses included the accruals related to stockbased compensation and stock based bonus and incentive plans of  million and  million respectively and  million for the amortization of purchase intangible assets gaap operating expenses also included  million of restructuring charges related to the closure of our atlanta and austin facilities commensurate with the rolling off of the entropic video soc revenues and related support overhead and  in acquisition and integration related expenses payouts under our second half  performance bonus plan will be settled primarily in shares of maxlinear stock which are expected to be issued in q of  net of these items nongaap opex was  million or  below our prior guidance of  million and  million lower than in q  and up approximately  million from the year ago quarter fourth quarter gaap opex attributable to rd was down approximately  million quarteronquarter and up approximately  million yearonyear to  million which included stockbased compensation of  million  million related to the second half of  stock based bonus plan and accruals and the final incentive award compensation related to our physpeed acquisition and  of amortized purchase intangibles excluding these items fourth quarter nongaap rd was down approximately  million quarteronquarter and up approximately  million yearonyear to  million within the sequential rd spending decrease there was  in lower payroll and headcount related expenses  in lower occupancy costs and  in lower tape out expenses these sequential decreases were partially offset by  increase in design tool spending fourth quarter gaap opex attributable to sga was down approximately  quarteronquarter and down  million from the year ago quarter to  million gaap sga expense included  million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets  million in stockbased compensation  in stock based bonus plan accruals and the final incentive award compensation related to our physpeed acquisition and  in acquisition and integration costs primarily related to our announced acquisition of marvell’s ghn business excluding these items fourth quarter nongaap sga was down  on a quarteronquarter basis and up  from the year ago quarter to  million with the sequential decrease driven primarily by occupancy and other overhead related savings only partially offset by higher sales commission expenses patent expenses and professional fees at the end of the fourth quarter of  our headcount was  as compared to  at the end of the third quarter of  and  at the end of the fourth quarter  we continue to evaluate our staffing levels globally particularly following our recent acquisition activity to strike a balance between driving nearterm bottom line operating leverage and staffing key longterm growth initiatives gaap income from operations was  million in q compared to income from operations of  million in the prior quarter and a loss from operations of  million in q of last year gaap income from operations was  million for the full year  versus the gaap loss from operations of  million for  gaap earnings per share in the fourth quarter were  on fully diluted shares outstanding of  million this compares to gaap eps of  in the prior quarter and a loss of  per share in q of last year for the full year  gaap earnings per share were  compared to full year  gaap losses per share of  nongaap earnings per share in q were  on fully diluted shares of  million compared to  per share in q of  and  per share in q of last year for the full year  nongaap income per share or earnings per share was  compared to full year  nongaap eps of  on a fully diluted basis as you may recall  losses were heavily influenced by the significant purchase accounting impacts of the entropic acquisition that closed in may of  moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement our cash cash equivalents and investments balance increased  million from the end of q  to approximately  million and increased  million as compared to  million in q of last year despite having closed the microsemi and broadcom wireless infrastructure asset deals for a total of  million our cash flow for operations in the fourth quarter  was approximately  million versus  million generated in the third quarter of  and  million in the year ago quarter our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was approximately  days or  days more than in the prior quarter and  days more than in the year ago quarter the increase in day sales outstanding is primarily a function of changes in shipment linearity as well as the general lengthening of payment terms granted to some of our largest direct customers as a result we only recognize revenue on a sellthrough basis and as such were not subject to revenue fluctuations caused by changes in distributor inventory levels our inventory turns were  in the fourth quarter compared to  turns in the third quarter and  turns in the year ago quarter at disclosed in our earnings press release and mentioned earlier in the call we have executed a definitive agreement to purchase marvells ghn business for  million in cash and expect the acquisition to close early in the second quarter of  as such our q guidance does not include any operating contributions from the pending acquisition during the first quarter nor does our guidance include any potential acquisition related charges including those for amortization of purchase intangible assets we expect the ghn business to be dilutive to our gaap earnings in  primarily due to acquisition related purchase accounting impacts and to be roughly neutral to our nongaap earnings in  we will provide more color on the expected financial impact of the deal postclosing that leaves me to our guidance we expect revenue in the first quarter of  to be in the range of  million to  million built into this range we expect seasonally strong operator revenues to account for roughly  of overall revenue and infrastructure other the remaining  more specifically within our operator we expect growth to be driven primarily by strength across our cable data cable video and moca cable products combined with growth in terrestrial settop box tuner demodulator soc shipments supporting analog to digital broadcast conversions in south america and to return to growth in our satellite k gateway business within infrastructure and other in which we are now including the increasingly negligible and tropic legacy video soc revenue we expect growth from our wireless access products to be offset by step back in wireless backhaul after a strong fourth quarter as well as a step back in highspeed optic interconnect revenues and also by seasonal weakness in tv and consumer terrestrial settop box once we get beyond q  we expect revenue and unit shipment growth in our gig laser drivers in china as fiber upgrades expand to tier ii cities and dense metro regions additionally we are ramping new solutions across both latest drivers and tias addressing  gigabaud  gigabaud and  gigabaud coherent datacenter metro and long haul applications across an increasingly diverse set of customers and geographies as referenced by kishore earlier that leads me to the remainder of our q  guidance we expect gaap gross profit margin to be approximately  of revenue and nongaap gross profit margins to be approximately  of revenue the sequential lift in gaap gross margin is due primarily to the rolloff of the amortization of acquired inventory step ups in q the forecast of sequential decline in nongaap gross margins is primarily due to the mix influence of growth in terrestrial transceiver shipments supporting the south american analog digital broadcast conversions which is expected to be a temporary one or two quarter mix effect as a reminder our gross profit margin percentage forecast could vary plus or minus  depending on product mix and other factors we continue to fund strategic development programs targeted delivering attractive topline growth as we look forward into  and beyond with a particular focus on infrastructure initiatives and our goals of increasing the operating leverage in the business as such we expect q  gaap operating expenses to decrease approximately  million quarteronquarter to approximately  million with the largest decreases coming from the removal of restructuring expenses lower tape out expenses and lower patent spending partially offset by seasonal stepups in payroll related expenses trade shows and cad tools we expect that q  nongaap operating expenses will increase  sequentially to approximately  million driven by the early referenced items in closing were pleased to report to close the very eventful and successful  our progress in acquiring and integrating new growth initiatives and diversifying our product portfolio and end market exposure have enabled us to deliver significant revenue growth and expansion in both gross and operating margins and more than a doubling of our annual cash flow from operations also as reflected in our guidance we feel increasingly confident about the resumption of our sequential revenue growth starting in q  we continue to expand our served addressable markets organically and through strategic acquisitions furthered by the marvell’s ghn acquisition announced earlier today we believe these inorganic diversification initiatives position us to uniquely exploit and benefit from the growing demand for bandwidth across consumer operator and wired and wireless infrastructure platforms and with that wed like to open the call to questions operator questionandanswer session operator ladies

tore svanberg yes thank you first question in the past youve given us targets for the year especially with some of your newer businesses like last year you gave us the fiber optics target if we look at  do you have targets at this point for the fiber optics business and also wireless infrastructure kishore seendripu so hi tore this is kishore the last year was we gave you targets which we exceeded to be closer to the high end of the range for the fiber optic business this year i think as we were alluding it in the previous calls we expect the revenue to be somewhere between  million to  million hopefully closer to the  million range for the optical fiber within that context the revenue increases will be primarily driven by new product launches in linear tias and linear drivers for the  gigabaud  gigabaud markets and then for lr applications which weve got design wins weve started initial shipments across the broad range of customers so as our tia product portfolio expands and catch its momentum later half of second  of  we expect the revenues to grow and so that’s where we gave you the range today for the fiber optics business on the wireless  the wireless business as a whole i think we have given we have  i think weve earlier talked to you about correct me if im wrong adam we have given guidance somewhere in the  million to  million range of revenues for  we reinforce the guidance on those as well tore svanberg very good and with the acquisition of marvell ghn business first of all does it come with any revenues this year and can you also talk a little bit about what this does as far as expanding your sam adam spice sure ill take the finance question and kishore can talk about the sam expansion so yes it does come with the revenues the business is coming with  yes i would say call it nascent revenues but certainly gave us a strong pipeline of design wins and platforms that are already ramping so this is in the business where we have to wait for the revenue to start to develop its already in place its growing its de minimis to say for example in the qq timeframe that we’re talking about the close will happen in q it’s in the low singledigit millions of dollars of revenue and that’s when i mentioned in the prepared remarks that we expect it to be essentially neutral to nongaap earnings in  and of course it assumes maybe could be a little bit dilutive in the first quarter and then kind of a little accretive in the q period but it’s kind of in the neutral boundary for  and the margin profile of the business is very consistent with the rest of the maxlinear business so we’re pretty excited about adding this to the mix and kishore do you want to talk about sam kishore seendripu so in connection with the ghn platform marvell’s ghn platform is the most advanced platform for the power line multi gigabit home connectivity using the power lines and twisted pair and so this nicely complements our very very strong position in moca and together we will be the undisputed technology leader for wireline connectivity moca as a coaxial connectivity platform is prevalent primarily in north america europe and a few other parts of the world for distribution of data inside the home however there are large telecom operators and especially those that serve database on xdsl or fiber and gfast that would like to use a twisted pair or a power line wireline connectivity and today we don’t address those customers platforms so if you really add up the major telecoms in china alone on the telecom side china telecom alone has  million subscriber homes but if you add up all of these countries and homes where there is no coax preinstalled inside the home the subscriber base that we can address on the connectivity for broadband is quite substantial so at this point i would say the wireline connectivity tam has at least doubled from what it was before from let’s say  million subscriber homes to now anywhere between  million to  million subscriber homes so that’s how i would characterize the expansion in the sam so is that okay tore for you tore svanberg yes no that’s great and last question is on moca so you mentioned you are already shipping the moca  solution i am just wondering as we look at the whole year does that mean moca could actually grow this year since you’re already starting shipments now or will it still be some puts and takes with the older version of the moca product kishore seendripu i think moca is a very promising one we expect that compared to  we have  we experience some growth and specially this particular design with the large wireless operator for the latest offering on moca is very promising and we expect to see some growth having said that on the existing cable platforms the older entropic moca solution  solution will be the substantial revenue driver for us and that will remain so until we get through  on a run rate basis however this is great news for us in terms of our product that we just launched getting good traction design win at a very very large us wireless operator and we are very excited about that tore svanberg very good thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gary mobley with the benchmark company please proceed with your question gary mobley hi guys thanks for taking my question wanted to ask about  growth i am assuming that’s not to be a growth year for you guys but maybe if we’re so lucky you can give us some general parameters to as far as growth considerations and if you’re not willing to give that maybe if you could speak to when we might see the first past of yearoveryear comp might it be in third quarter of  adam spice yes it’s pretty early in the year gary as far as kind of put a definitive line in the indiscernible when the sequential or when the yearonyear turn positive i think to your point we’re not right now we’re not pointing to a positive full yearonyear increase i think that would be  if we got there that would be a huge accomplishment for us that’s not currently in our planning scenarios today that said there are opportunities in the second half of the year certainly to reclaim a positive yearoveryear comparison gary mobley okay and  opex could you give some general  some of your general budgeting considerations in why to think about opex adam spice yes our view on opex really hasnt changed of course when we tuckin the marvell ghn business well update you guys as far as what that means for spending but right now i think weve said earlier that we expect to be able to roughly keep our opex flat yearonyear and there will be movements in there for there is things in the mix and there is timing of tape outs that can make it little bit lumpy quarteronquarter so for example this quarter it was a step up still in the range i think last year when people were asking me similar question i would say that in  we probably expect to see opex anywhere between call it a number would be  million plus to maybe as high as  million in any given quarter so i think youve got about a  million or  million range within any quarter for opex but i think were going to be able to contain it to within that range and hopefully get pretty close to flat  to  for the full year gary mobley okay given the geographical differences and used cases between moca and ghn im assuming there is perhaps limited customer overlap but in those cases where you do have overlap or i guess ask differently have you had any discussions with the different telcos queued up to deploy ghn for marvell and how you guys might benefit from this or augment if you drove that plans kishore seendripu gary its a very very good question and thats why i went fairly deep into explaining the differences between moca and ghn the general operator situation is quite separate its very complementary acquisition for this reason the telecom operator that subscribe to the itu standards do not use moca for the distribution inside the home they like to use that twisted pair and thats why into the home they use gfast or exdsl or fiber ethernet into the home so in those circumstances outside of north america there is no corruption between the ghn moca situation and its a very very large market and for those telcos ghn will primarily most likely prevail as a distribution standard they will be slightly different in north america where coax is totally prevalent in the home and there moca wins outside because if you comparable ghn moca is still a far superior connectivity medium because youre sending data over a shielded copper line so moca is far superior to ghn however the ghn wave two technology from marvell accomplishes on twisted pair a gigabit plus data rates that otherwise was not possible in the past so what it offers for us is now to go and sell the product to all the telcos that are deploying exdsl dsl gfast or fiber outside of north america where the itu standards line up and offer them a connectivity solution called ghn and with that entry into that platforms we can now start crossselling other technology portfolio ip elements that we have within the maxlinear capabilities so thats the game plan you have to expand the tam enter the sam and expand the sam gary mobley okay alright thank you guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ross seymore with deutsche bank please proceed with your question ross seymore hi guys thanks for all the end market color that you give i guess looking back on the other side of legacy you talked about the  million in the fourth quarter from the legacy video soc can you size for us where the analog channel stacking was and give us an idea of how you expect that to fall off as we go forward adam spice yes ross this is adam look on the analog channel stacking we were telling people that they should expect somewhere in the range of call it  million in q and thats exactly where we landed so i think it was very consistent with our expectations and the expectations for q we were telling folks to expect somewhere between say  million and  million in the first quarter and i think we will actually do better than that so i think the fall off sequentially q to q is probably a little less or a little more subdued than we were thinking a month or so ago but its still very much in that for the year its nothing what we changed it seems like just a little bit more gradual decline q to q and maybe even q to q but when you look at the year in its entirety nothing has really changed ross seymore and then as we look into the guidance for the march quarter and you talked a little bit about what the gross margin puts and takes were can you go into a little bit more color about that terrestrial business i assume that must be in the operator side of the equation to get you to your  million or  of sales but i’m surprised it has that much of an impact on the business so talk a little bit about the leverage on that gross margin line if you could please adam spice it actually it’s a fairly stark step up because really the revenue really wasn’t there in q at all it’s really kind of a q and q and it’s very operator specific deployment cadence that’s really again first half of  focused so it’s kind of a burstee happen for a couple of quarters and then go away it’s kind of a onetime revenue event it’s leveraging a very old product that we have in our portfolio it’s our isdbt to the demod soc that we’ve been shipping since i think what about  and so i’d say it’s for this particular opportunity it was a fairly comparative process because again it’s lagging technology and other people could throw their hat in the ring we threw our hat in the ring and we were pretty aggressive to try to drive the remaining contribution margin dollars from those old products on our side of the ledger and we were successfully in doing that but it did come at a cost as far as overall gross margin optics or mix for the company kishore seendripu and it’s really not that much of a mystery because if you look at the hddta deployments that brazil was promising to deploy before the olympics and then the world cup and then just kept delaying and then their political issues and then the currency issues and finally they have pulled the trigger and they have placed for the year above  million to  million units of hddta box with their government subsidize through the operators and the bulk of that is going to be shipped in the first half of  and so if you look at a product thats got no cogs optimization for the last six seven years and we are not going to do anything about it and so it was perishable revenue and we decided to take it basically adam spice the overall margin ross to give you an idea i mean it’s actually from a kishore’s point there is not a lot of support or other overhead kind of tied to this particular product but it’s quite a bit lower than many times lower than our corporate average it is that’s why it has such a dilutive impact it’s pretty poor gross margin but it’s not bad when you look at it purely on contribution margin dollars kishore seendripu and  but the good news is that so the margin will bounce back higher once these shipments have happened through q and maybe early part of q so we are not overly concerned it was tough for us to not walk away from the contribution margin ross seymore and then i guess the final question i would have is the it sounds like the majority of it is that business going up but it also has the wireless infrastructure and the high speed interconnect businesses sound they are going down sequentially so talk a little bit about the reason for those fallowing off and i assume that thats negative mix implication for the gross margin as well that that might reverse when those two businesses start growing again adam spice absolutely on the wireless business this is our first year in it really speaking the beginning of the last year at this time of business we didn’t have a business in wireless so if you really look at that from that prospective we are experiencing what maybe a seasonal or capex spending step down in preparation for budget outlays by telecom operators but we had a very strong q for both our wireless access and wireless backhaul which we are very very pleased because at the time of these two acquisitions we got a little anxious about maybe there was some pull we have estimated things wrongly so we are very happy about that on the second piece on optical side once again it’s our first real q with no distortion we are being cautious china went to the chinese new year and we had a little bit of backlog coverage issues it goes through the distributor and so we are taking a cautious approach but generally we think we’ve consolidated our market share in the laser driver market with the two main chinese tier  oem while our tias are just beginning to ram so still the bulk of the revenues in the laser driver is with the two chinese tier  oem and so we are waiting to see if the promised increase in the market size of  to  that we are told by our customers materializes so we’re just begin careful about it as well and obviously there is some forward pricing of the products as well in preparation for taking the big share of the market that they expect it will increase ross seymore great thanks guys kishore seendripu yes operator thank you our next question comes from the line of anil doradla with william blair investment management please proceed with your question anil doradla hi guys just a couple of clarifications so on building up on ross’s question were there some strategic reasons beyond just the contribution margin or getting that top line for pursuing these terrestrial sales and going forward would this be could we see such events these oneoff events playing out in the course of  and i have followup kishore seendripu okay anil i think you ask a very very good question if you recall what adam said it is an operator business so these are major operators in brazil we have our satellite front end satellite digital outdoor unit shipments these designs one believe it or not three to four years ago if you look at our earnings transcripts from that point of time we keep talking about this and finally it happen when you had completely given up so there was no way to walk off from that because these designs were done and our base band partners on that side for the mtek decoders they are committed so you don’t walk away from the situation so you call it strategic yes the actions were strategic to remain in the socket but the business itself is not strategic for us and we have continuously emphasized that but to the extent there is a broadband operator and it is on our broadband platforms we will support them and secondly none of the other businesses outside of the terrestrial dta stuff are these well below corporate margin products for us so hopefully these are one time blip and you have noticed that last year we have steadily over every quarter improved our gross margin in fact q was around  and we hope to get back there as rapidly as possible so i wouldn’t look it as a systematic pattern at all it’s a onetime blip and as far as i am aware there are no more ddp operator businesses out there that we are now serving anil doradla so it’s fair to say i am sure what you’re saying if this opportunity would have being presented to you today you would not have  you would have walked away from it kishore seendripu absolutely anil doradla wonderful and on the channel breakdown for cable can you help us understand the breakdown between    today and as you exit the year  how should we be looking at that adam spice yes i guess that’s quite a bit of detail i think that if you look at certainly that the trend has been to consolidate around  channel so the bulk of our volumes now are  channel in the cable data docsis market there is an increasing amount of  channel there as well so you are really seeing the  we never had much of a  channel presence there is really  channel and the market moved on this pretty quickly where we got share in  and now on  and of course now we are facing the docsis  ramp which we’ve talked before is really more of a second half phenomenon so i would say that it’s moved to our favor that we have got higher asp volume transitions to the higher channel count and i don’t see anything kind of offsetting it the next wave is just coming going than from  and  to operators that are being kind of the earlier ones to deploy docsis  which right now of course we have been talking about comcast being tip of the sphere for docsis  deployments anil doradla okay and just a clarification adam did you quantify the impacts of this terrestrial revenue was this  bps or  bps on the gross margin i missed that i think adam spice we haven’t broken that out but i would say it was based on the guidance for our q guidance had it not been for this particular thing it probably cost us i would say probably around   i’d say it’s probably  basis points is probably a reasonable estimate for that anil doradla okay wonderful and looking forward to  thanks adam spice great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of quinn bolton with needham  company please proceed quinn bolton hey adam and kishore just wanted to followup maybe you just answer it did you say that the impact from this the terrestrial satellite business in brazil was about  basis points of the sequential decline in gross margin adam spice it’s about right kishore seendripu that’s correct quinn bolton okay so i mean these are isdbt  demod i mean it’s there you see actually higher price for it in that market you said something about  million or  million units should we be thinking price of about box so it’s maybe  million to  million spread across those two quarters is that about the right kishore seendripu you could have been our sales or marketing incharge quinn bolton okay adam spice you’re pretty close you are in the right ballpark quinn bolton okay great second question on the ghn you said i think kishore over sort of twisted indiscernible the marvel solution team get a gigabit per second surprised they didn’t realized that ghn was up that faster i guess what’s your thought on the competitive outlook versus wifi in those markets today that are served by power liner twister pair kishore seendripu you ask a very complicated question when i talk of gigabit plus ghn every standard and every connectivity standard talks about gigabit plus as the holy grail but actually what is really the most important criteria is whether it’s wifi or ghn or moca is like how much reliably the bandwidth you get at a particular distance per user reliably right these are all peak data rate statements and that’s really a few hundred megabits right so and that too in speed too that means it’s really they’re doing that by adding more bandwidth on ghn and likewise it is true for wifi as well wifi is even worse with coverage and the robustness as you move out of the home so what it’s playing out into is that and you have seen announcement for example of retail products where they’re improving wifi coverage by using ghn or powerline connectivity as the backbone but in the operator side they are augmenting their wifi coverage by using these wired powerline connectivity as the backbone and have local adapters between the power line connectivity and the wifi so that you can use wifi locally at the distribution point in the united states moca is the preferred one by all the cable operators and because it’s the most robust medium of connectivity maybe the coaxial cable which is shielded and so nothing comes close to it so i think that ghn is really going to be more a nonus nonnorth america parts of europe phenomenon and it’s going to be complementary in terms of just like moca will be in the united states for wifi coverage quinn bolton okay great thanks for that color and then just lastly in the prepared comments i think you said you have now expanded the highspeed or optical customer based to  different customers i know your two lead customers in china were kind of china long haul of those  that you start to ship to this year could you give us some sense how many of those would be coherent applications how many of those would be datacenter applications and perhaps importantly how many those are outside of china just to give us some sense of the geographic diversification of that customer base kishore seendripu i would say out of the  about  will be outside of china and the one new one in the china will be a small player and then two will be in japan and the rest of them will be both japan and north america combine so they’re in both locations so put it differently all the diversification is coming outside of china however most of this diversification is coming at least half or more in the tia space and the shipments into china for tias happen through outside of china china does not do rose sourcing from their suppliers inside china they are really nonchinese players who supply roses into the chinese market because of the software security technology in terms of photo detector and alignments with the tia to ensure that you’ve got maximum sensitivity so put it simply the end market maybe china but all the customers are primarily nonchinese quinn bolton okay any sense data centers versus coherent kishore seendripu okay the datacenter piece obviously on the  i would say i do not have a breakdown with that but i would say that the same players that are there in the coherent are also in the data center and those are two or three of those big module guys and there is one guy was pure datacenter quinn bolton great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian alger with roth capital partners please proceed with your question brian alger hi guys thanks for squeezing me in all my questions have been asked just a couple of follow ups i think you mentioned that the satellite digital outdoor was actually up doubledigit im just wondering if that was an excepted growth or if that was better than expected kishore seendripu so i would say it was an expected growth though it’s lumpy and as weve always struggled with these broadband operators cable and satellite their behavior is quite sporadic in the qq window some will order more in q some will not ordering in q and will order in q so it’s really were going through the what i call the vacillations in order patterns from these satellite and cable operators so really i wouldn’t read much into that as more than expected if you integrate it over the  over a two quarter window it’s probably is expected brian alger okay and as we make the transition away from the analog stacking and move towards digital do we expect that volatility in the order pattern to dissipate kishore seendripu i don’t think you should expect when it involves operators the  certain seasonality in the year to dissipate now whether you can call it volatility or seasonality i don’t know but generally these operators pace as we have noticed q is strong if we just go with the cable operators and q is reasonable q they may go all the way down and then q to come back up or they pick up in a hurry at the end of q and they go down in q so really there is a two quarters window of good nice healthy order fulfillment and after that it sort of so so so i think that that kind of a behavioral pattern i expect it to remain brian alger okay and just a quick i guess enquiry with regards to this ghn business i think you guys mentioned the development teams out of valencia curious as to how many people are part of that team and what kind of opex level were looking at obviously you described it a little bit as being earnings mutual plus or minus personnel wise what are we looking at adam spice so the team today is a team of about  people in valencia and then there is a handful of people outside of valencia in the us so i think one of the benefits that were seeing from picking up a team in valencia actually is the cost is actually pretty reasonable compared to us development efforts so it’s actually just helps us to give a broader kind of diversification of resourcing across now we have burnaby british columbia weve got a very big design center in india weve got a nice size design center in herzliya israel and in addition to irvine and carlsbad and also hsinchu taiwan so were getting a pretty global footprint and this is just kind of expands that actually gives us one of our lower cost locations so were not at the point yet but we’ll give you more colors as we get close to the deal close because weve really just  weve not really completed our integration planning for the entity quite yet kishore seendripu i mean it’s very interesting right certainly doubt on me as i was thinking about this question is that well have close to about  rd design engineering base with valencia’s addition to maxlinear’s already big rd team and that’s quite exciting because it means they were optimizing our rd opex quite nicely across the best talent in the world geographically while taking advantage of the differences in cost structure brian alger all right good well i appreciate all the detail today guys appreciate your answer on all the new answers of the business thank you kishore seendripu thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of erik rasmussen with stifel nicolaus please proceed erik rasmussen yes thanks guys for allowing me to get a followup here just on the tax rate adam what should we be modeling for  adam spice i think most if i look at where your colleagues are at and kind of where weve been directionally pointing people weve said that tax rate will kind of migrate its way up towards  as we progress through the year and i don’t think anything has really changed off of that you should be getting to it overall right now based on everything we know and of course your tax is a very difficult thing to predict right now given all the noise that’s coming out of washington but right now nothing is causing us to change our outlook and i would say that if you’ve got a blended tax rate that’s in the midteens on a nongaap basis or for  i think you’re in pretty good spot really no need to change where you’re at erik rasmussen okay thanks and just one last one and it’s on the docsis  it sounds like things are on track for more of a bigger ramp in the second half of the year two things anything that could potentially push that out a little bit that you might foresee now and then also any sort of size of how big that business could be whether it’s in revenue or penetration or those sort of things kishore seendripu so eric i think you asked a very very good question and if you recall even in last year beginning of the last year in the first half i was saying that having set the patterns of docsis  deployment i expect the revenue ramp for docsis  to happen in the second half of  and it seems that thats all its playing out is there a risk for the rollout yes sure in a sense that its not as big as they wanted to be at this stage but its indisputable that by q q the following year is going to have massive one so i think that it is going to be a ramp in second half but how it starts in q versus q i cannot speak for there will be a big ramp and i do expect that there will be more growth in data subscribers for at least the big player like comcast and with the way things are playing out you have heard about syndication of comcast x platform to other cable operators the uptick in docsis  will happen much faster because it would spread to multiple operators very rapidly so it could be yet be one of the biggest ramps for the docsis platform secondly for us there is an increase in the bom and as always where a new standard deploys and we should benefit from that so we expect growth coming out of the docsis  for sure erik rasmussen thanks so much operator thank you our last question is a followup from ross seymore with deutsche bank please proceed ross seymore hi guys one housekeeping item and one more real question i guess adam the stockbased comp and share count i know this is when you compensate people and bonuses with shares not money so what is the answer to those two for the first quarter please adam spice weve been running about  million a quarter in stockbased comp and little over  million a quarter in stockbased comp and about around  million per quarter in stock based bonus as i dont think you should assume any real deviations from that and then on the share count i think on a fully diluted basis weve been i think were modeling around probably around  million shares ross seymore got it and then the less housekeeping related question if you go into your high speed interconnect business kishore you talked a lot about the number customers increasing in the geographies increasing as well if my math is right it sounds like you ended the year at about a  million quarterly run rate and you talked about potentially getting to a  million number when the first quarter is down that kind of imply there is going to be a big pop somewhere and i know that business is always lumpy but any help you can provide on either seasonality or timing of new product ramps or new customer launches that gives you confidence in that hockey stick at some point during the later three quarters of this year kishore seendripu i mean the clear answer is that i just want to make this kind of clear there is a lot of attention to these higher gigabaud  gigabaud  gigabaud  gigabaud linear products but really thats the small percentage of the big deployments that are happening in china and that will be the case for them because they want cost to be low and for the next two years the  gigabit nrz is going to be the big hugest portion of the deployments so having said that we are launching the tias and the ramp of these tias is what is going to drive the growth and that will the second  and i expect the pops to start happening in the second half of the year sometime now the good thing about the tias is that they tend to margin rich unlike drivers which tend to be modules but the negative thing about them is that it take a longer time to qualify because people will roses that have got very good complicated optical alignment issues and then people buy roses directly into the main boxes so you have this dichotomy between the two so if the qualification cycle stay on track the ramps happen in second half and can get pushed around a little bit yes therefore im being cautious when i give you the range of  million to  million of guidance for optical revenues for  and at the ofc which is in march sometime we will be announcing a bunch of new products and there will be demos and i think from that point there will be a good visibility of all the new products in the linear market that coherent market that we will be launching which is primarily the  gigabaud  gigabaud and  gigabaud products but the  and  gigabaud products will not generate any meaningful revenue until  or beyond and that is just the fact for the industry ross seymore great thanks for the detail kishore seendripu yes operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our questionandanswer session at this time i will turn it back to management for closing remarks kishore seendripu well thank you operator as a reminder well be participating in the susquehanna financial group th annual semi storage

you may begin gideon massey thank you operator good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on todays conference call to discuss maxlinears first quarter  financial results todays conference call is being hosted by dr kishore seendripu ceo and adam spice cfo during the course of todays conference call we will discuss our financial performance and review our business activities for the first quarter specifically the recently closed acquisition of marvells ghn business and the anticipated tender offer close of exar corporation after our prepared comments we will take questions our comments today will include various forwardlooking statements within the meaning of applicable security laws including without limitation statements relating to our current projections forecasts and expectations with respect to second quarter  revenues and revenue contribution from key product markets as well as gross profit percentage and operating expenses on a gaap and nongaap basis the potential impact on our business of recently completed acquisitions the anticipated closing of our acquisition of exar and any acquisitions we may pursue into future and our current views regarding opportunities and trends in our market including our current views of the potential for growth in each of our target markets these projections expectations and other forwardlooking statements involve substantial risk and uncertainties in our current  and our actual results may differ materially from currently forecasted results risks potentially affecting these statements in our business generally include risk related to the closing of exar corporation and substantial integration challenges we may face that could affect our ability to realize currently anticipated synergies substantial competition in our markets in particular from increasingly large players as our industry consolidates potentially declines in average selling prices and factors that could adversely affect our operating expenses such as litigation asset impairment or restructuring in addition our target markets including target markets we may pursue through acquisition or  including our recent acquisition of marvells ghn business and pending acquisitions of exar may not grow in the manner or at the rates we currently expect we face risks associated with consolidation trends in our operator markets and we face integration risk associated with acquisitions for a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties potentially affecting the forwardlooking statements we make today in our business generally we encourage investors to review the sections captioned risk factors in our quarterly report on form q which we expect to file shortly and our annual report on form k for the year ended december   which we filed on february   any forwardlooking statements are made as of today and maxlinear does not currently intend and has no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements the first quarter  earnings release is available in the investor relations section of our website at maxlinearcom in addition we report certain historical financial metrics including gross margin operating expenses net income or loss and net income or loss per share on both a gaap and nongaap basis our nongaap presentation excludes certain expense items as discussed in detail in the press release available on our website the press release available on our website also includes a reconciliation of our gaap and nongaap presentations which we encourage investors to review it is not our intent that the nongaap financial measures discussed today replace the presentation of maxlinear gaap financial results were providing this information to enable investors to perform more meaningful comparisons of operating results and more clearly highlight the results of core ongoing operations in a manner similar to managements analysis of our business we do not provide a reconciliation for forwardlooking nongaap gross margin and operating expense guidance which excludes estimates for stockbased compensation expense bonus accruals acquisitionrelated expenses and restructuring charges each of these expense items is explained in greater detail in the press release the timing and amounts of these future expenses which we would need to provide a reconciliation of nongaap margin and operating expense guidance are inherently unpredictable or outside our control to predict accordingly we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of forwardlooking nongaap estimates without unreasonable effort material changes to any of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future gaap results lastly this call is being webcast and a replay will be available for  weeks and now let me turn the call over to kishore seendripu ceo of maxlinear kishore seendripu thank you gideon and good afternoon everyone thank you all for joining us today before delving into the financial details were very excited to report that q  represents maxlinears return to sequential revenue growth our q  revenue was  million which is about the midpoint of our prior guidance we also continue to follow through and make significant progress on our strategic goals of diversifying and expanding our served addressable market the close of our acquisition of marvells ghn business on april  the anticipated close of our tender offer for exar corporation on may  and the strong design win and technical milestone achievements around our organic broadband and infrastructure development initiatives together attest to the rapid progress we have made on our strategy in terms of organic development were very excited about our progress towards securing key oem design wins for our pam  gigabit per lambda solution our pam solution will be used for optical high speed interconnects in next generation  gigabits per second hyper scale data center applications this will be an important driver of maxlinears revenue growth starting in the second half of  we also recorded our first moca  revenue contribution from a large tier  telco operator in north america this is an important milestone for our moca connectivity market penetration beyond the existing cable and satellite operator markets we also commenced initial shipments of our technology leading microwave backhaul cmos rf transceiver solution spanning  gigahertz to  gigahertz wireless carrier spectrum were resolutely pursuing opportunities to expand our cmos analog and mixedsignal footprint in our existing broadband operator platform at the same time were expanding into the large and growing optical interconnect and wireless infrastructure markets our twin strategic goals of one expanding our footprint in maxlinears existing broadband platforms and two going into large highvalue infrastructure markets will be greatly advanced by the acquisition of exar corporation in addition exar brings with it broad and strategic end market diversification into the large industrial and automotive market at the same time it strengthens and expands our analog and mixedsignal platform offering in maxlinears core markets with the addition of exars proven interface and power management solutions and capabilities the combination of these organic and inorganic initiatives increases our confidence in our ability to continue to grow and diversify our revenues were also well positioned to become a leader in the high performance analog and mixed signal market moving on to our q  results our revenue of  million in q of  was in line with prior guidance up  sequentially and down  yearoveryear owing to the previously anticipated declines of entropic end of life satellite analog channel stacking and video soc products im very excited with our return to sequential top line growth even as we navigate through the tail end of the declines from our legacy entropic products our return to sequential growth validates our strategy of diversification of revenues across large highvalue end markets consisting of broadband access and communications infrastructure in the first quarter we saw strength across cable operated terrestrial settop box mocabased clink wireline active infrastructure and g wireless carrier access these revenue strengths overcame declines at satellite outdoor units longhaul metro optical interconnect and wireless backhaul revenues now moving to the specifics of our business highlights for the first quarter of  within operator we see continued strength in our cable data business as we benefit from our strategy of offering our broadband operator customers an expanded portfolio of cohesive platform solutions we continue to expand our footprint and value to our customers with our cohesive platform offerings these include our recently acquired ghn portfolio our first post entropic developed  gigabit plus moca  solution which is now being deployed by a tier  telco operator and our cable pga companion devices there continue to be exciting technology expansion opportunities in broadband such as our upcoming moca  solution which is capable of  gigabits per second connectivity speeds this products on track to ramp late in the second half of  our recently acquired ghn connectivity and access products combined with the mocabased portfolio enable us to broadly serve wireline access and broadband connected home applications regardless of the wireline medium we expect these products will prove to be meaningful revenue contributors to the rest of  i am pleased to note that the integration of marvells ghn business is proceeding quite smoothly were excited by the quality of the team and the deep customer engagements particularly with large international telcos were currently at the very early stages of deployments of our nextgeneration ghn wave  technology we expect our ghn business to grow strongly through the second half of  and into  albeit off a small base moving to our infrastructure and other business we experienced weakness in highspeed fiber interconnect revenues owing to the impact of the weak unit growth in the chinese market coupled with the asp reductions we have offered to our customers in january despite the weak macro environment were encouraged by our emerging fiber revenue diversification due to the strong customer traction for our  transimpedence amplifier or tia devices one servicing the  by  gigabit nrz data center market and the other addressing  kilometer lr  telco application as mentioned earlier were extremely excited by the progress made towards securing our initial tier  oem design wins for our  gigabit pam data center interconnect solution while were gaining confidence in both our product expansion initiative and their competitive position in the near term were not immune to the headwinds from china which has been commented on by several of our peers however were benefiting from our end market revenue diversification strategy as we continue to invest in rd to gain competitive advantage in fiber even in the face of weak china telco fiber deployments in q  within our wireless infrastructure wireless access experienced meaningful sequential revenue growth which was offset by a step back in microwave backhaul following an unexpectedly strong q were excited about the near term and long term prospects for both our wireless access and microwave backhaul initiatives both are poised to be significant drivers of our infrastructure revenue growth in  our organically developed microwave backhaul cmos rf transceiver spanning  to  gigahertz of carrier spectrum recorded its first meaningful revenue in q  we expect to see this product ramp at several large oems starting in late to second half  given customer engagements and design wins on both the microwave modem and the rf transceiver combined with the growth potential for our g rf transceiver organic development initiative will enable us to become a leading full platform technology provider in the large and evolving wireless infrastructure market we also saw strong sequential growth for our mocabased clink wireline access solutions our mocabased clink products are being used in last mile highspeed data access and distribution deployments by several chinese cable msos the recent addition of marvells ghn access solutions further expands our opportunity in this addressable market before i turn the call over to adam spice our chief financial officer i would like to reiterate that were extremely pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter with the return to sequential growth in revenue and continued strong cash flow generation were pleased with the increasing diversification of our revenue streams across broadband access and wired and wireless infrastructure this diversification will be further enhanced with the addition of highperformance analog products consisting of bom management enterprise solution through the acquisition of exar we anticipate a tender offer for the acquisition of exar to close later this week as we navigate through the rest of  were excited about our product expansion strong customer and end market diversification potential and the sustainability of our core broadband infrastructure technology platform we look forward to sharing more information regarding the progress of our development initiative in the coming months now let me turn the call over to mr adam spice our chief financial officer for a review of the financials and our forward guidance adam spice right thank you kishore i will first review our q  results and then briefly discuss our outlook for q  as kishore noted our q revenue was  million up  sequentially consistent with our guidance operator revenues increased  sequentially and account for  of total revenue in the quarter within operator we witnessed particular strength in docsis  channel rf receiver socs and companion pgas an increase in terrestrial receiver shipments to a south american operator as well as seasonal sequential strength in cable video shipments within satellite growth was driven by k gateway front ends while channel stacking outdoor unit shipments were down due in large part to continued declines in legacy analog products legacy video soc revenues derived from the entropic acquisition came in at a sequentially flat  million at the highend of our expectations or  of total revenues we continue to expect the legacy video soc business to be at a negligible  of our total revenues in  moving to our infrastructure and other products revenues declined approximately  and accounted for roughly  of total revenue in the quarter within this mix we witnessed strong sequential growth in wireless access as well as growth in clink wireline broadband access in china these areas of growth were more than offset by seasonal softness in the consumer tv and settop box platforms as well as sequential declines in highspeed fiber interconnect and wireless backhaul for reasons referenced earlier in the call by kishore gaap and nongaap gross margins for the first quarter were approximately  and  of revenue respectively in line with our prior guidance of  for gaap and above our prior guidance of  for nongaap gross margin the upside to nongaap gross margin guidance was primarily driven by incremental supply chain cost savings offsetting the impact of the lower margin terrestrial receiver shipments into a latin american operator in the quarter this compares to gaap and nongaap gross margin of  and  respectively in the fourth quarter of  and gaap and nongaap gross margin of  and  respectively in the yearago quarter the delta between gaap and nongaap gross margins in the first quarter was primarily acquisition related reflecting the amortization of  million of purchased intangible assets and a lesser  of stockbased compensation and stockbased bonus accruals q gaap operating expenses were approximately  million which was  million above guidance with the overage primarily related to higher acquisition and integration cost that could not be estimated at the time of guidance partially offset by lower payroll consulting prototyping and patentrelated spending gaap operating expenses included stockbased compensation and accruals to our stockbased bonus plan of  million and  million respectively  million for acquisition and integration costs  million for the amortization of purchased intangible assets and  for ip litigation costs related to previously disclosed cresta tech litigation matter payouts under our  bonus performance bonus plan if earned are expected to be settled primarily in shares of maxlinear stock which are expected to be issued in q  net of these items nongaap opex was  million which was  below our prior guidance of  million flat to q  and up approximately  from the yearago quarter first gaap opex  sorry first quarter gaap opex attributable to rd was down approximately  quarteron quarter and up approximately  yearonyear to  million which included stock based compensation of  million  million related to  stockbased bonus plan accruals and  of amortized purchased intangibles excluding these items first quarter nongaap rd was up slightly quarteron quarter and up approximately  yearonyear to  million within the roughly flat sequential rd spend there was  in higher payroll related expenses largely owing to the sequential  sorry the seasonal payroll tax reset and  in higher design tools expenses which were largely offset by sequential reductions of  in prototyping and other project related spending first quarter gaap opex attributable to sga was up approximately  million quarteron quarter and up  million in the yearago quarter to  million gaap sga expenses included  million in acquisition and integration costs primarily related to the closing of our acquisition of marvells ghn business in early april and our planned acquisition of exar corporation gaap sga expenses also included  million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets  million in stockbased compensation  of stockbased bonus plan accruals and  for ip litigation costs excluding these items first quarter nongaap sga was down slightly quarteron quarter and up  from the yearago quarter to  million rounding out our commentary on operating expenses at the end of the first quarter  our headcount was  compared to  at the end of the fourth quarter of  and  at the end of the first quarter of  we continue to evaluate our staffing levels globally particularly following our recent acquisition activity to strike a balance between driving near term operating leverage and staffing key long term growth initiatives gaap income from operations in the first quarter was  million compared to  million in the prior quarter and  million in the first quarter of  gaap earnings per share in the first quarter were  on fully diluted shares outstanding of  million this compares to gaap eps of  in the prior quarter and  per share in the first quarter of  nongaap income from operations was  million in q compared to income from operations of  million in the prior quarter and  million in q of last year nongaap earnings per share in the first quarter were  on fully diluted shares of  million compared to  per share in q of  and  per share in q  moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement our cash cash equivalents restricted cash and investments balance increased  million in the quarter to approximately  million and decreased  million as compared to the  million in q of last year our cash flow from operations in the first quarter  was approximately  million versus the  million generated in the fourth quarter of  and the  million in the yearago quarter our day sales outstanding for the first quarter was approximately  days or  days more than the prior quarter and  days more than the yearago quarter the increase in days sales outstanding is primarily a function of changes in shipping linearity as well as a general lengthening of payment terms granted to some of our largest creditworthy direct customers as a reminder we only recognize revenue on a sellthrough basis and such were not subject to revenue fluctuations caused by changes in distributor inventory levels our inventory turns were  in the first quarter compared to  turns in the fourth quarter and  turns in the yearago quarter that leads me to our guidance because were still in the formal tender offer process we believe its prudent to exclude any exar contributions from our guidance pending a successful tender offer and closing we do plan to provide a combined business update shortly after closing excluding any contributions from exar we expect revenue in the second quarter of  to be in the range of  million to  million built in this range we expect operator revenues to account for roughly  of overall revenue and contributions from infrastructure and other to represent the remaining  more specifically within operator we expect growth to be driven primarily by strength across our cable data satellite digital outdoor unit and broadband connectivity products partially offset by declines in our residual entropic legacy satellite stacking and video soc revenues which we expect to contribute approximately  million in the quarter versus contributing approximately  million in the q  quarter since the legacy video soc revenue largely supports operator applications were including this portion of revenue in operator revenues within infrastructure and other we expect growth from both microwave backhaul and wireline access with wireline growth derived from both clink and ghn broadband access solutions these areas of infrastructure strength are anticipated to be only partially offset by a small step back in wireless access after a strong first quarter and flatness across highspeed optical interconnect and consumer tv applications that leads me to the remainder of our q  guidance we expect gaap gross profit margin excluding exar to be approximately  to  of revenue and nongaap gross profit margins to be approximately  to  of revenue the expected sequential decline in gaap gross margin is primarily due to inventory step ups and amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the closing of our acquisition of marvells ghn business as a reminder our gross profit margin percentage forecast could vary plus or minus  depending on product mix and other factors we continue to fund strategic development programs targeted at delivering attractive top line growth as we look forward to the second half of  and beyond with a particular focus on infrastructure initiatives and our goal of increasing the operating leverage in the business we expect q  gaap operating expenses to increase approximately  million quarteron quarter to approximately  million with the largest increases coming from the amortization of purchased intangibles headcount additions related to our ghn acquisition tapeouts and other project related expenses that were pushed out from q we expect that q  nongaap operating expenses will increase approximately  million sequentially to  million driven by the earlier referenced items excluding the amortization of purchased intangibles in closing were pleased to report a very busy and eventful q  one in which we returned in the quarter to sequential revenue growth while executing on several corporate development projects and organic growth initiatives that should lead to strong future revenue growth and diversification of our product portfolio our preclosing exar integration efforts are progressing well and were encouraged by exars march quarter results published separately today as highlighted by the  basis point and  basis point improvements in gaap and nongaap gross margins to  and  respectively we remain confident that the exar and marvell ghn acquisitions combined with the organic initiatives kishore highlighted earlier will uniquely position maxlinear shareholders to benefit from the growing demand for broadband across consumer broadband industrial and network infrastructure platforms and with that id like to now to turn  open the call to questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from tore svanberg with stifel tore svanberg congratulations on the execution in a very busy quarter first question could you just talk a little bit more about your infrastructure business kind of for the whole year i know you cant give guidance but just sort of some of the moving parts it sounds like clink now is really starting to become more material which i think is a bit of a positive surprise obviously got the new products and new customers and the high speed interconnect business how should we just think about how the infrastructure revenue plays out for the whole year with some of these moving parts adam spice tore this is adam so yes i mean were encouraged by what were seeing in our infrastructure business its obviously expanding from a footprint pretty aggressively i think based on the guidance we just provided obviously were pointing to a pretty strong growth sequentially from q to q and i think probably the most encouraging thing as i mentioned a little bit earlier was just the breadth across which were now realizing these revenues its not just one area that we have  different flavors of access wireline access across moca and the ghn actually clink and ghn in addition to wireless backhaul the microwave backhaul and the wireless access for the g and g infrastructure markets obviously the optical interconnect markets which have not only expanded from our  gig laser driver to also adding the tias that are starting to ramp as kishore mentioned in his commentary and then also when kishore mentioned kind of the encouraging signs that were seeing on the customer engagement front for our  gig solution for the hyper scale market so i think that youre seeing a very very rapidly evolving and diversifying infrastructure platform for maxlinear and again i think youre starting to see the results of that come through not only just in the development initiatives but also on the revenue fallthrough because again were looking at a pretty exciting q to q on the infrastructure ramp side tore svanberg very good and as my followup question you mentioned that the legacy revenue would be about  million in the june quarter i  my math sort of works maybe legacy video soc about  million and analog channels which are  million i think you said the outdoor revenue would actually be up sequentially so does that mean youre starting to see growth again in the digital part of the outdoor market and should we think of this  million kind of being the baseline going forward or will it probably continue to come down in the second half of the year adam spice yes so the  right now were looking at growth in our digital channel stacking product q to q pretty significant growth actually q to q so thats encouraging and then the just the continued decline as expected on the analog channelstacking side of things it was towards the high end of our range for q we said  million to  million it came closer to  million for the analog channelstacking contribution in q that will drop below  million in the q period so were seeing pretty significant drop off as expected q to q off a higher base in q but then again as i mentioned the growth in the going forward business which is the digital channel stacking actually looks encouraging sequentially q and q so overall i think you look across channel stacking q and q its more flat than growing its really but its just  the mix is changing because analogs declining aggressively while digital grows aggressively to backfill that hole operator our next question comes from ross seymore with deutsche bank ross seymore just wanted to dig in a little bit into the operator side of things in the sequential drop as a percentage of revenues is it and forgive me if im just not doing the math as fast as tore just did but if the analog channelstacking side was flat whats the headwind in the operator side going into the june quarter and as we think about that business throughout the year talk a little bit about docsis  and when that comes in and how you expect it to contribute to your revenues adam spice so ross just to clarify so  again when i said the analog is actually declining and the digital is growing in the channel stacking so youve got a call it a almost a  million decline sequentially in the  and expected in the analog channel stacking and then youve got growth of approximately that much to offset that on the digital side so think of channel stacking as roughly flat sequentially but with analog declining and digital growing to offset it ross seymore the docsis  side adam spice no no im talking about the satellite channel stacking just  ross seymore the second part of my question its  sorry adam adam spice okay second part of the question so on the docsis side were looking at  consistent with prior years the first half is looking very good for our docsis business i think that were seeing growth in units i think the content increases from the companion pga attach rate is helping out quite a bit as well to provide a full platform solution yes no i think the first half of  is playing out pretty much as we have expected it from the strength on the cable docsis side ross seymore i guess as a my followup adam you talked about opex going up a little bit you folded in one acquisition and i realized this is all going to change within a short period of time when exar comes into the fold but from what you have now with the ghn side of things from that  million opex that you just guided to what would we think about that going forward is that the new run rate is there synergy opportunities below that how should we consider opex through the rest of the year adam spice i think youve found  when weve had a bunch of acquisition activity like we did in  and  is certainly set off to be no different in fact maybe more so we continue to get synergies as we progress through the year so i would say its too early to really say what the certainly what the second half of opex is going to look like again like you said its going to change quite a bit once we move exar into the fold but if you kind of look at maxlinears organic business excluding exar so like the organic lets say preexar maxlinear i think that  million is a pretty good proxy for the run rate of our  of that existing preexar business because we had a little bit of a step up in q related to some pushouts and tape outs that were going to happen in q pushed into q but netnet i think when we entered the year before we contemplated doing the ghn acquisition we were saying that opex could kind of range anywhere between at the low point could be as low as  million at the high point could be as high as  million and that was kind of a  million bom that we put on any quarter of nongaap opex and so this puts us just a little bit above that high end of that range and again that range didnt anticipate doing this deal which if you look at the expenses related to the marvell ghn acquisition it adds about call it  million of run rate per quarter opex so you can imagine if you kind of excluded that from the guidance we just gave for q that would put us more like  million which again would still have been well within that band of  million to  million so i think right now that  million feels about right kind of a new level hopefully we continue to get more operational synergies as we progress through the year i think weve got a history of showing that but thats  i think thats a decent place to think of our opex excluding exar on a quarterly basis for the remainder of the year operator our next question comes from brian alger with roth capital partners brian alger just curious as the commentary about china obviously theres a little bit of exposure there it seems that that should be de minimis though given everything else thats going on within the infrastructure business for us can you maybe characterize the sensitivity that you guys have to that market slowdown kishore seendripu brian this is kishore for us i think this is  whats happened in china is a validation of a company thats focused on diversifying revenues across various different infrastructure platforms all of them are growth platforms in the longer term on a secular basis so you saw that there were a number of areas that we grew very nicely that nicely overcame the declines in fiber in some of the areas so if were really pleased that they returned to the sequential growth even in the face of declines in fiber coming to the question of what our sensitivity to the fiber revenues i want to give you a little bit of an overview our infrastructure revenues today all the infrastructure components of our revenue whether its wireless backhaul wireless access highspeed interconnect which is another word for fiber and clink ghn access each of those categories are in the teens for sure in some cases in the  million plus range its very nicely diversified so with that commentary we had begun this year saying that we will be in the revenue range around  million and above maybe as high as  million but given the  whats happened in china over the first  quarters we feel that the answer is somewhere below that the  million more like  million to  million if things occur quickly in q if they dont then were looking at the low side of the  million that is the level of sensitivity we have in terms of the revenue contribution from fiber having said that the second half we anticipate  we got these highperformance linear tias for the longest time the market had only one supplier now our product is being designed into various platforms at the various top layers of roses or icrs in the long haul metro markets i think that when this market recovers we will definitely be in the pole position competing for those new socket that emerge so the tias are the most exciting part on the longhaul side for sb the gigabaud or gigabaud or gigabaud and then we have product offerings that are now just beginning to ship in the lr  markets for telcos were the first ones deploying that with the very new product and obviously at the end of this year by the end of this year well be sampling our  gigabit single lambda  gigabits per lambda  gigabits solution for the hyper scale data centers so all in all fiber whats happening in the chinese market is a very de minimis impact for us obviously it subtracts on yearonyear comparisons that we were going to show to be a pretty strong grower however our real growth comes from new products being launched in fiber and gaining more market share in new sockets while the remaining parts of the company are growing pretty nicely brian alger i really appreciate the detailed explanation there it certainly seems like the sensitivity to china is so much less than upside you have coming from the tias as well as the data center side so thanks again on that i just have one followup the wireless backhaul infrastructure that we see coming down the pike for the g implementation appears to be kind of the first phase or the early phase of the deployments where are we  where is maxlinear positioned on that and is that that still something thats  or  quarters out before we see an inflection point or is there early signs that its coming kishore seendripu so i think really speaking even today as we speak our run rate revenues come from the g lte markets and the wireless backhaul products associated with that and as you know wireless backhaul is really strongly prevalent outside the united states its the primary backhaul mechanism outside the us and china markets so our growth is coming from those markets they are sensitive to telco spending and really g should not impact how wireless backhaul plays out its got a steady stream and were gaining market share and growing the position both in the modem and were deploying our rf transceiver when g happens right the real inflection point will come in millimeter wave backhaul where we would like to deploy a lot more bandwidth and we have the right modem and radio parts for that market as well and weve got i would say almost all of the tier  designs and if not substantially all of the designs in the marketplace so when that g happens we would be in a very good position to benefit from it i really think that the g market really turns the corner sometimes towards the end of next year in terms of meaningful revenues that are substantial in comparison to the microwave backhaul so i dont see that happening anytime in the next  months or so its the second half of  is when you should start seeing some growth in the millimeter wave backhaul revenues operator our next question comes from chris rolland with susquehanna christopher rolland kind of tying into your last comments kishore i wonder if you had any thoughts on what seems like a bidding war for straight path these guys are in the  and  gigahertz spectrum and then also given your kind of unique ability to address so many frequencies perhaps you can talk about what you think your biggest opportunities are going to be is it going to be in the kind of  gigahertz opportunity or do you think something more unique like a  or  gigahertz to the millimeter wave stuff youre talking about might be a better market for you kishore seendripu so chris i cannot comment more about straight path im not particularly aware of them having said that our products range all the way from  gigahertz to  gigahertz and then beyond that the millimeter wave product range from  the modem works across the frequency band from  gigahertz to  gigahertz but the radio works between  to  gigahertz frequencies which is not ramped to production yet so i think we would be the only one that has a full systemlevel solution to address all the frequency regimes that the carriers may choose to deploy for what they call g i want to remind you that g has  flavors one flavor is g is below  gigahertz spectrum another flavor of g is in the  gigahertz and above spectrum and the first deployments of g will really be in the frequencies below  gigahertz with lots of good coverage because of the nature of the frequency spectrum and our initiatives in g similar access would address these markets very very well and i still feel the market will not turn the corner on g as we all think about is multigigabits per second data rates until the end of  and then it ramps probably into  and we all know that the way the transition happens from g to g to g its been pretty choppy lets put it that way so having said that this is going to happen below  gigahertz first thats the network deployment the infrastructure already exists whereas for the one beyond  gigahertz it would just be initially a point to point link and our modem and our radio chips will be very well positioned to address those christopher rolland great and then a question for adam on the gross margin side perhaps adam you could talk a bit about kind of the exact supply chain cost savings you were talking about for some of the upside on the quarter and then quantify maybe the drag from brazil settop box and maybe comment on other puts and takes as we think about the gross margin equation moving forward here adam spice yes i think  i mean the supply chain cost improvements that we got in q were really just a continuation of what our group has  our supplychain groups been able to deliver over time i think consistent with a lot of other groups ive worked with in the past they tend not to give you everything upfront that they think they can potentially get so kind of undercommit and overdeliver and i think thats really what we saw in q and it really came across the whole supply chain whether its the wafer side with wafer cost reductions which is really a result of us being able to balance across a variety of foundries so were not limited to one particular foundry we gain leverage from being able to go across multiple foundries for all of our products pretty much and then of course the team is relentless across not only the supplychain team but the engineering team in getting test time reductions and really dialing in improvements on test time and yield so its really kind of a team effort across supply chain and engineering and its just something there the team always seems to  every time i think ive beaten the sand out of their forecast they seem to have a bit more left so  it was just consistent with prior quarters i think youve seen from us  we usually do a little bit better on gross margin again trying to undercommit and overdeliver when you look forward i guess ill address the second part of your question which is related to the latin american operator settop box lower margin contribution we forecast that pretty well going into the quarter and we said it was going to be a  quarter effect it was going to be kind of we have more contribution in q and q from that particular design win that was shipping that will tail off as we forecasted in the second half of the year so as indiscernible to that that natural drag on gross margin starts to erode as well as the increased mix from operator again gives us confidence that were in a good gross margin range and were always looking for more but we think were in a pretty good position now having hopefully set the low watermark in q for gross margins for the year and then as far as the kind of the rest of the gross margin picture as we move forward again as we mix more and more towards infrastructure that should be beneficial to the long term gross margin target we said for quite some time that our corporate goal is to be in the  to  range obviously as we get more infrastructure it should skew towards the high end of that range but i really dont see right now i dont see anything significantly kind of north or even north of  points in our current line of sight for  could that come into focus in  and beyond it absolutely should but we  its still a little bit too far off to speculate on those kind of improvements kishore seendripu one of the other challenges were faced with as we integrate these acquisitions they come with their own products and its very very hard to rely on their gross margins that we see in the reports in the  preceding to our acquisition and with confidence say that the variance on their cog is what we would treat accountingwise variance as well right those uncertainties really give us some pause before we could really give you more color and so i think that as these acquisitions create a little bit more uncertainty on the gross margin variant and this quarter was no different to some degree on that so were still assimilating variances that are associated with our microwave for a wireless access product that we acquired from microsemi for example and saving the backhaul case so i think that gross margins will get healthier and as adam said we dont want to get ahead there without really getting on top of all the minutiae that comes in the variances in cogs operator our next question comes from quinn bolton with needham  company quinn bolton i hate to rain kind of on the cable data parade but i think almost every year since you guys have been public that youve seen strength in the first half especially on a unit basis in the cable data modem market you guys have typically seen seasonal softness either in q q wondering what your thoughts are in terms of seasonal patterns in the cable data market this year especially with the  what now appears to be stronger than expected ramp of docsis  can that docsis  ramp offset what otherwise might be normal seasonality in either q q then i have a couple of followups kishore seendripu so hey quinn talking of parades it did rain in california here so it did rain on our parade but having said that the docsis revenues are strong but the really coming strong of docsis  revenues the  ramp is just starting and i would not yet blow the bugle here on docsis  yet we hope and anticipate that docsis  ramps strongly and were very well positioned to benefit so if theres upside coming in the second half that to buck the trend that we have talked about in the past or we have been subject to  would be it in a positive way there is something else going on here when we talk about operator revenues in those same cable platforms were offering different content day we offering our pga asp associated with their pga amplifiers and therefore thats more asp than we had before on both our  platforms the new  platforms that have got designed in last year and then weve got moca flavors on these platforms and then theres also some retail flavors where ghn is being deployed just slightly on the cable platform so all in all theres more asp today on our platforms its incrementally growing as even on the existing  platforms so i think our real cable growth is coming from also asp increase while the trends on the telco seasonal behavior we dont see why that would be any different unless  takes off very strongly because our asp kind of helps us move ahead of that one as well quinn bolton great in your script you seem to be a little bit more upbeat on the potential opportunity around your singular lambda pam saying that it feels like youre well positioned for several design wins that seems much more upbeat than perhaps even lfc or the last quarter conference call is there anything that has made you more upbeat about that market or is it really still status quo on that product kishore seendripu i was probably at upbeat then as well but maybe i did a better job being quiet about it so in the script probably i could not resist revealing that the reality is this right we were the newcomers coming into the market about  years ago with all our competitors bending their singular lambda something right and we said we took an approach that doesnt make any sense in reducing the cost of ownership per gigabit of transmission and so we leapt forward and invested in  gigabit per lambda turns out there were a couple of other players who are investing in that and our latest intelligence tells us that theyve fallen flat on their face in their executions so suddenly the traction is really in our direction and im taking my bets on maxlinear that we do execute whatever what we say we will so thats why im feeling more upbeat because now the deck is completely clear to run the table on the design wins quinn bolton great then just wanted to the come back to the clink business i think going back a couple of years from now as part of entropic it seems like it was a sub  million a quarter kind of business never seemed to get a lot of traction if i heard your comments kishore i think you said it may now be a business that could be running close to  million a year i just wanted to confirm that i heard you right and if so whats really driving the adoption of that clink technology because moca over coaxis is sorry over ethernet has been around for a while so whats driving the adoption now kishore seendripu i wont call it moca over ethernet but its a clink access a distribution to the multibuilding unit et cetera what you call the last mile if you will whats really happened is what we have done what we have done is weve really worked patiently with all the operators debugged all their issues and their all kinds of compatibility issues we put a lot of investment in fixing those issues and we also had to depopulate certain deployments that entropic had had in the chinese market and so finally we have cleared the deck for full compatibility excellent interoperability for all of the clink access points on the cable for access solutions in the chinese market so really putting a lot of money and it is not going to be  i said it will be all of our components are in the teens but definitely its a very growing part of our revenue and were quite excited about that part of it and we look forward more of its growth actually adam spice so quinn id put a little bit more specificity to it so i think what you heard earlier was between  if you look at our wireline access part of infrastructure which goes across the ghn acquired products from marvell plus our clink that came from entropic those  products together as we exit  will be on a north of  million run rate so if you look at wireline access on a runrate basis exiting  itll be north of  million per year not per quarter per year operator our next question comes from anil doradla with william blair anil doradla so kishore we see a lot of focus on this china and the optical we saw you guys highlighting this before everyone else and its pretty bad out there so  questions here will you be the first when it comes to be a leading indicator on the turnaround and as weve seen in the past over several years whenever we get into these territories a lot of irrational pricing kicks in weve seen it with tuners weve seen it in other things now granted were slightly different here but what makes you confident that we wont see some very irrational pricing kishore seendripu i never preclude the human ingenuity for irrational behavior so i would say youre dead on on that part of it having said that now starts the real competition right for the markets are all going up everybody is feeling all gungho about it because of incumbencies and their shipping but now when the pause comes the newcomers come in and they start staking out the position pretty nicely so youd have a new cast of characters at a table and were really excited theres an opportunity actually because the market transitions from a limiting market to a linear markets in a big way and weve got all the best parts in the world that were sampling today in tia and drivers right now so regarding being a leading indicator no well never be the leading indicator of great news we generally tend to be leading indicators of what i call unfavorable news so that you guys have all the information and we have the luxury to do it as a diversified revenue company our strategy is very clear we want to be highly diversified highvalue end marketfocused revenue company and that affords us to really not focus on one part of our addressable market to drive the companys growth so i believe that we feel were honest people but in all honesty is helped by our circumstances as well anil doradla good and as a quick followup theres a lot of g deployments going on in india were you  did you guys participate through the microsemi acquisition some of the wireless infrastructure stuff where you part of any of those deployments kishore seendripu india leading g charge that anil doradla i mean g sorry g not g kishore seendripu g no most of our deployments of g access are in actually the united states they go to a major tier  player in europe oem and they are actually for the most part into the united states so its really good run rate business we also have some  actually pretty  but actually our access grew quite nicely and its still growing because japan is deploying some high bandwidth access solutions lets call it the japanese version of g really the low frequencies in the  gigahertz frequency band thats a unique band available in japan and our solutions the only one that can address that part of the carrier spectrum because the unique architecture the epm microsemi engineers have designed and were benefiting from that but yes were seeing growth for g in japan but most of our shipment revenues today is in g in the united states shipping through europe and oems operator our next question comes from tore svanberg with stifel tore svanberg i just had two followups if you dont mind so with clink and also the moca  ramping second half of the year does that mean that moca related revenue will actually be up in  kishore seendripu lets see we actually categorize moca as part of moca clink thats infrastructure the other part is in the operator maybe adam you could answer that question adam spice well if look at across clink and moca cpe yes there will be they will increase  to  tore svanberg very good and kishore i was hoping you could just update us on moca  and the  then moca user as a broadband backbone just any data points any design wins you have to suggest that that market will actually indeed take place kishore seendripu you know we have the design wins the deployments are slow however we did talk about a new telco in north america deploying our moca in the distribution elements of it so they are using moca  in the  not in the main gateway but in the distribution side as both backbone element and in the client device thats being designed in and the revenues have started however on the  so its moca  by the way because its a gigabit plus solution  is a sub  gigabit which is about  megabits or so so  is sort of  its got an important threshold more than  gigabit of data and the next design phase well actually implement moca  in the gateway were working with them were hoping that ramps at the end of the year so yes there is progress being made but its actually being lead more by these new telco than our existing cable guys operator ladies and gentlemen we reached the end of the question as a session id like to turn the call back over to kishore seendripu for closing comments kishore seendripu thank you operator as a reminder well be participating in the benchmark company oneonone conference in chicago on june  the stifel  technology internet and media conference in san
