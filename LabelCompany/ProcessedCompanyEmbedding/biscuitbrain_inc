specific firearm characteristic that can classify the firearm as an assault weapon while there are several characteristics that can classify a firearm as an assault weapon the receiver spur focuses on one key characteristic as detailed below click here to view the nysafe features presentation to see any images or descriptions to aid in diagnosing your firearm what is the spur the spur is a nylon  injection molded component that can be used to replace a protruding pistol grip on an ar rifle this durable piece will not absorb solvents or oils commonly found around firearms increasing the durability of the spur this component is custom molded by s  b products inc a company built with the sportsman in mind s  b has leveraged the knowledge of a law enforcement officer with over  years of experience to create a product that will allow sportsmen with a specific firearm to try to conform to the guidelines set forth by the safe act we deal in small  large volumes the best way to get a price is email us and let us know the quantity you seek spur pricing email us dealer pricing available for dealers only call  understanding the safe act the nysafe act has impacted the landscape of firearm ownership this act in particular has greatly impacted the owners of ar rifles in nys and more specifically those looking to own an ar in the state of new york below are the criteria by which a firearm falls under the safe act if the sole criteria governing your firearm is the one below the stars then the receiver spur is a viable solution does the firearm have a folding or telescoping stock does the firearm have a protruding pistol grip does the firearm have a thumbhole stock does the firearm have a second handgrip or a protruding pistol grip that can be utilized by the nonshooting hand does the firearm have a bayonet mount does the firearm have a flash surpressor does the firearm have a muzzle break does the firearm have a grenade launcher does the firearm have a threaded barrel to accommodate flash surpression or muzzle breaks youve got questions weve got answers below are some of the most commonly asked questions associated with the receiver spur and where it stands with respect to the nys safe act does the receiver spur need to be permanently attached to an ar rifle no the receiver spur is a permanently modified part that cannot be turned into a pistol grip the nysafe act states that modifications to remove certain features is permissible will the spur fit the ar yes the spur does fit the ar and functions properly however aesthetically there is a small gap at the back of the spur where it meets the gun will it help with the safe act we have not received anything in writing from nys we are currently pressing the state for an official written determination we are confident the ar receiver spur does not run afoul of the law our attorney assures us we have not misrepresented our product or what it accomplishes the ny safe act permits modifications to remove design characteristics that define a rifle as an assault weapon has nys ruled on the spur yet short answer is no nothing in writing from nys yet every lawful authority state and local we have conferred with has assured us the ar receiver spur does not run afoul of the law we are going to continue to press the state for a written determination i spent  years in law enforcement and i am confident this modification relieves the rifle from the assault weapon definition if the pistol grip is the sole characteristic have questions fire away  please enter all details

• july    am bst first of all leaving the eu gives us back control of our trade policy we can do deals with our trading partners and we can do them quickly  i would expect the new prime minister on september th to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners i would expect that the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within between  and  monthsthe flood of new regulation from europe will be halted there is also a political or perhaps sentimental point the great british industrial working classes voted overwhelmingly for brexit i am not at all attracted by the idea of rewarding them by cutting their rights this is in any event unnecessary and we can significantly improve our growth rate by stopping the flood of unnecessary market and product regulation we should also continue with the programme of lessening the tax burdenthe ideal outcome is continued tarifffree access once the european nations realise that we are not going to budge on control of our borders they will want to talk in their own interest  there may be some complexities about rules of origin and narrowlybased regulatory compliance for exports into the eu but that is all manageable we should work out what we do in the improbable event of the eu taking a dog in the manger attitude to single market tariff free access and insist on wto rules and levies including  per cent levies on car exports let us be clear i do not believe for a moment that that will happen but let us humour the prereferendum treasury fantasyso how will this look if we get it right  we will have a more dynamic economy trading throughout the world  our businesses will have greater global opportunities and will be more competitive there will be lower prices in the shops once we are outside the common external tariff  there will be higher wages for the poorest  an immigration system that allows us to control numbers  control of our laws so our lives are not hampered by needless and restrictive regulationsthis approach should allow us to present to the british electorate in  the early fruits of a successful global tradebased economic strategy as we build our place in the world first of all leaving the eu gives us back control of our trade policy we can do deals with our trading partners and we can do them quickly i would expect the new prime minister
