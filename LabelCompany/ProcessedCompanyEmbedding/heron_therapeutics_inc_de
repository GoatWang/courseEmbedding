from time to time we may evaluate acquisition opportunities and engage in related discussions with other companies pending the use of the net proceeds we intend to invest the net proceeds in shortterm interestbearing investmentgrade securities apf is expected to face significant competition for the prevention of delayed cinv principally from eisai’s aloxi palonosetron in addition to aloxi apf will compete with entrenched generic forms of granisetron formerly marketed by roche as kytril and ondansetron formerly marketed by glaxosmithkline as zofran generic versions of aloxi may become available after its scheduled patent expiration date which was recently extended to  there are ongoing challenges to the aloxi patents which may shorten the effective patent term we are also aware of several companies that have developed or are developing both generic and new formulations of granisetron including transdermal formulations such as prostrakan’s sancuso® granisetron transdermal patch there are several companies that are developing new formulations of existing drugs using novel drug delivery technologies many of these companies have substantially greater financial research and development manufacturing sales and marketing and distribution resources and experience than we do the following are some of our major competitors among drug delivery system developers alkermes inc durect corporation and pacira pharmaceuticals inc smaller or early stage companies and research institutions may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical companies we will also face competition from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring and inlicensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or potentially advantageous to our business if any of our competitors succeed in obtaining approval from the fda or other regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we do or for products that are more effective or less costly than ours our commercial opportunity could be significantly reduced major technological changes can happen quickly in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and the development of technologically improved or different products or drug delivery technologies may make our product candidates or platform technologies obsolete or noncompetitive company description ap pharma inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing products using its proprietary biochronomer™ polymerbased drug delivery platform this drug delivery platform is designed to improve the therapeutic profile of injectable pharmaceuticals by converting them from products that must be injected once or twice per day to products that need to be injected only once every one or two weeks the company’s lead product candidate apf also known as sustol is being developed for the prevention of both acute chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting cinv for patients undergoing moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy and for the prevention of delayed cinv for patients undergoing moderately emetogenic chemotherapy one of the most debilitating side effects of cancer chemotherapy cinv is a leading cause of premature discontinuations of treatment there is only one injectable ht antagonist approved for the prevention of delayedonset cinv so this indication represents an area of particular unmet medical need apf contains the ht antagonist granisetron formulated in the company’s proprietary biochronomer drug delivery system which allows therapeutic drug levels to be maintained for five days with a single subcutaneous injection this fiveday range is designed to cover the delayed phase of cinv granisetron was selected for apf because it is widely prescribed by physicians based on a wellestablished record of safety and efficacy apf targets a large market opportunity with approximately  million doses of chemotherapy annually in the us alone in may  we filed a new drug application nda seeking approval for apf with the us food and drug administration fda the fda issued a complete response letter for the apf nda in march  in september  we resubmitted our nda for apf and in march  we received a second complete response letter which identified several remaining issues that need to be addressed prior to approval of the apf nda in its current form we are currently working on addressing these issues and expect to resubmit the apf nda in the first quarter of  additionally we are exploring the potential use of our biochronomer polymer with other drugs and intend to pursue the clinical development or one or more other drug candidates based on our proprietary delivery platform in november  we initiated a program to expand our pipeline of sustained release products including a new program targeting the relief of postsurgical pain as of  approximately  million procedures associated with postoperative pain were conducted in the us which is expected to grow to  million by  in addition us postoperative pain market sales are expected to grow  annually from approximately  million in  to  billion by  this market growth is primarily being driven by the increasing number of procedures and by new reformulations we own the worldwide rights to apf and are in the early stages of building the commercial infrastructure necessary to commercialize apf in the us on our own
