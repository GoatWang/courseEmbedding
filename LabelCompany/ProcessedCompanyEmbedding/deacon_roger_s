wiki answers todd mathersanswered w agobrian and roger have been asked this question a lot and theyve always been kind of evasive in their answers but there have been snippets i think its a combination of factors he does have a number of kids i think its actually  so im sure he wanted to spend more time with them but the other vibe ive picked up on in interviews with brian and roger is that john was not really into the celebrity lifestyle and not really much of a people person if you look at old footage of the band he rarely spoke in interviews and even when he did he did not seem all that comfortable on stage he stuck to the background and stayed close to rogers drumkit most of the time i dont ever recall seeing him speak to the audience on stage except at the freddie mercury tribute concert where he look terrified in the book recently written by peter hince freddies and johns roadie he made reference to john getting more and more agitated on the  tour and at the end of one show throwing his bass in anger at one of the amps so my guess is he retired for the reasons mentioned above plus the fact that he has tons of money and really didnt want to keep living in high profile world that he really didnt feel all that comfortable ink views ·  upvotespromoted by qplumfree investment planningdesign your plan before investinglearn more at qplumcorelated questionsmore

factsdoes john deacon still write musicwould john deacon have continued with queen had freddie mercury not diedis queens john deacon underrated eva sanchez former writeranswered w agoas many have noted john deacon had a very close relationship with freddie mercury queen was freddie mercury although the other three members were very talented but it was freddies song writing that propelled queen to international fame and it was freddies vibrant and electric performances that captured fans around the world once freddie died the life and breath was gone from queen john recognized this and made a personal choice that honored his good friend freddie mercury and made good professional sense no one can replace freddie no matter how many front men queen tries they are currently touring with adam lambert and personally i cant even watch one song or video with lambert it just doesnt seem right to lose someone of freddies caliber class and charisma and replace him with someone that lacks the qualities that made mercury the best male vocalist and performer of all time who can top that or at least equal that and stand in freddies place singing his music i wish brian may could acknowledge that queen ended when the king of queen left us we his true fans prefer to hear his records and see his music videos that are performed by freddie mercury otherwise its just not worth seeing someone who performs several notches down from freddies ability its impossible to replace or substitute thus gorgeous beautiful man with a voice of gold we love you freddie no one else will dok views ·  upvotes paloma pomaraga im a queen oficial fans club member and i think that i know a lot of things maybe not but i can help answered w agoyes john was a very good friend of freddiehe left the group when in  queen decided to do some songs for knights tale ost with robbie williams as a singer john began to suspect about a posible replacement of freddie and he disagreed he left the recording and left the studio in fact john gets money when roger or brian play some of his songs on tour so he is involucrated in the group but only for money the group disapeard when freddie diedk views ·
