benchling inc key developments benchling announces molecular biology  software jan   benchling announced the release of its molecular biology  system an unprecedented extension of its existing molecular biology suite to power highthroughput sequence design for dna proteins and crispr molecular biology  incorporates batch sequence design crispr design and cloning software as well as fullfledged protein design and alignment tools with the company platforms natively integrated bioregistration system and lab notebook molecular biology  brings the unique biological contextualization afforded by the company bioregistry to highthroughput molecular biology work conducted by industry scientists this allows for intelligent linkages between plasmids protein sequences and the parts they encode and offers transformative functionality for many areas of drug discovery such as immunotherapy gene therapy synthetic biology and antibody discovery in antibody discovery for example this allows a scientist to create a plasmid encoding for a heavy chain define a field on that plasmid that links to a protein sequence for the heavy chain and apply a constraint to confirm that the amino acids linked to are a translation of that region of the plasmid combined with molecular biology s batch sequence design and cloning tools which allow scientists to design sequences and in an industryfirst translate protein chains in batch the company has effectively created the first elnbased batch antibody engineering tool beyond molecular biology s protein design and alignment and batch design and cloning tools the company has developed the first batch crispr design tool for enterprise use building on top of the company platforms crispr tool which was codeveloped with leading academic labs at mit and harvard and boasts speeds x faster than its leading competitor batch crispr empowers scientists to design guides and gather ontarget and offtarget scores for hundreds of genes simultaneously the tool automatically detects exons for each gene and conducts the full analysis in seconds the company is already the de facto platform used by many of the most innovative crispr companies and teams around the world benchling launches bioregistration and inventory management system to enable accelerated biologics rd nov   benchling announced the launch of its bioregistry system releasing groundbreaking capabilities for complex biological entity registration and strain management the bioregistry is a major addition to benchlings cloud lab informatics platform and is integrated seamlessly with benchlings native lab notebook and molecular biology tools the benchling bioregistry extends beyond the scope of similar registration software through its flexibility for inventory complexity automatic data gathering through benchlings lab notebook and molecular biology tools and integrations with its upcoming lims product benchings bioregistry is the first software of its kind thats flexible enough to support the complex relationships of any biological entities it can accommodate the complete hierarchy of antibody discovery workflows encompassing antibody complexes protein chains and plasmids that encode those protein chains constraints can be easily configured to validate uniqueness at each level of this hierarchy and enforce biological validity such as ensuring protein chains are proper translations of plasmid regions through integration with benchlings lab notebook the bioregistry can create bidirectional links between notebook entries and registered entities users can view all entries where a particular entity was mentioned and all entities mentioned in a particular entry the bioregistry is also the first registration system thats natively integrated from the ground up with a full suite of molecular biology tools through this integration the bioregistry can register any plasmid file automatically parse it out into its parts and register those as well with those registered parts being automatically linked to the original registered plasmid and by combining registered parts scientists can create wholly new constructs the company estimates these automation features will increase research productivity by upwards of  through integration with benchlings indevelopment lims the bioregistry allows for sample tracking and lineage tracing for physical samples in the lab although benchlings lims is in limited rollout the lims and bioregistry work together to automatically parse results from notebook entries and append
