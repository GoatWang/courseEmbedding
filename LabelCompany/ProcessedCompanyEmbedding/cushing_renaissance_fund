out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

layers of sedimentary rock sometimes referred to as shale it wasn’t until advances in shale drilling technology that it became possible and costefficient to extract these natural resources these advancements in shale drilling technology have allowed the us to increase production of crude oil natural gas and natural gas liquids this is creating a competitive cost advantage for the us economy as energy prices here are considerably lower than in europe asia and most of the rest of the world we believe this domestic energy advantage will benefit the us economy including industrial manufacturing engineering and construction companies in fact many experts believe that advancements in these technologies create the potential for the us to become energy independent by  as more energy resources are tapped infrastructure will need to expand in order to handle the increased volume the us is producing more crude oil and natural gas  sources us energy information administration

circumstances the fund concentrates its investments in the natural resources sector with an emphasis on securities issued by mlps mlps and other natural resources sector companies are subject to certain risks including but not limited to the following – fluctuations in the prices of commodities – the highly cyclical nature of the natural resources sector may adversely affect the earnings or operating cash flows of the issuers in which the fund will invest – a significant decrease in the production of energy commodities would reduce the revenue operating income and operating cash flows of mlps and other natural resources sector companies and therefore their ability to make distributions or pay dividends – construction risk development risk acquisition risk or other risks arising from their specific business strategies – extreme weather conditions could adversely affect their securities – the amount of cash that the fund has available to distribute to shareholders will depend on the ability of the companies in which the fund has an interest to make distributions or pay dividends to their investors the tax character of those distributions or dividends and the us federal state and local income taxes imposed on the fund as a regular corporation or “c” corporation – the profitability of mlps and other natural resources sector companies are subject to significant foreign federal state and local regulation in virtually every aspect of their operations and could be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment – there is an inherent risk that mlps may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of their businesses and the substances they handle and the possibility exists that stricter laws regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase the compliance costs of mlps and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary which mlps may not be able to recover from insurance – the operations of mlps and other natural resources sector companies are subject to many hazards inherent in their business and since the september th terrorist attacks the us government has issued warnings that energy assets

extraordinary transactions and iv conflicts of interest between the general partner or managing member and its affiliates on the one hand and the limited partners or members on the other hand including those arising from incentive distribution payments or corporate opportunities the investment strategy of investing primarily in mlps and being treated as a regular corporation or “c” corporation rather than electing to be treated as a regulated investment company for us federal income tax purposes is a relatively new investment strategy for openend registered investment companies such as the funds this strategy involves complicated and in some cases unsettled accounting tax and net asset and share valuation aspects that cause mainstay cushing energy income fund and mainstay cushing mlp premier fund to differ significantly from most other openend registered investment companies this may result in unexpected and potentially significant accounting tax and valuation consequences for the funds and for their shareholders in addition accounting tax and valuation practices in this area are still developing and there may not always be a clear consensus among industry participants as to the most appropriate approach which may result in changes over time in the practices applied by the funds which in turn could have material adverse consequences on the funds and their shareholders mainstay cushing renaissance advantage fund small and midcap stocks are often more volatile and less liquid than largecap stocks smaller companies generally face higher risks due to
