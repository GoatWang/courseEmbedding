on june   at  pm updated june   at  am comments as the new ceo of the hershey co john p bilbrey isn’t expected to start by making wholesale changes — after all if it isn’t broke why fix it     instead bilbrey’s nod for the top spot is considered a good steady bet by the derry townshipbased chocolate maker     “it’s no surprise” said jack russo an analyst with edward jones who said bilbrey was the obvious choice for the job     view full sizejohn p bilbreybilbrey who served as interim ceo has been with the company since  and has a deep understanding of not only the company but also the general consumer products industry     for years he was the vice president of the company’s international arm and before that spent  years with procter  gamble     bilbrey was not available for an interview after the company’s announcement last week but the yearold is widely expected to build on the gains that his predecessor david west made over the last few years — especially in developing rapidly expanding overseas markets     the company has said that over the next few years it expects its international sales driven primarily by china and india to account for more than  billion erin lash who follows the hershey co for morningstar said she expects those targets to be on the top of bilbrey’s mind as he assumes control of the company but the candy company faces an uphill climb     the hershey co dominates the us market among chocolate makers but lags behind rivals kraft and mars internationally     “bilbrey’s resume includes numerous stints operating in international markets which could aid this endeavor” she wrote in a note to investors “however due to the beachheads that hershey’s competitors already maintain in these markets we don’t expect international growth to contribute meaningfully to the domestic confectionery firm’s results over the near term”     bilbrey has been considered west’s righthand man over the last few years and will inherit a company of  employees that has been having a resurgence after a downturn earlier this decade     during the last three years the company’s net income has increased by almost  percent and annual sales jumped from  billion to  billion through the end of      the company’s stock value has also shot up     earlier this spring the company traded under the symbol hsy was trading at threeyear highs and briefly broached  pershare     it retreated after the announcement that west was leaving but bilbrey’s nod for the top spot received votes of confidence from wall street — hershey co shares rose sharply in the days following the announcement     the profits came in the wake of significant changes — the company has reworked it supply chain closing factories and distribution centers across the united states     at times there were concerns if the hershey co would leave the town it’s founder created all together     but work is progressing on the west hershey chocolate plant which will ensure chocolate is produced in the town for decades to come     production work is expected to migrate from the original plant to the new facility at the end of this year and be completed by early      it remains to be seen what the company will do with milton s hershey’s original chocolate plant in the downtown area although the hershey co disclosed it has discussed a possible sale of the yearold building to one of the other hershey entities     the hershey trust co which manages a controlling interest in the hershey co has stated it is considering buying the property if the sale proceeds at least a piece of the property will be renovated and leased back to the hershey co for use as its corporate offices     it’s speculated the remainder of the factory — more than a million square feet — could be redeveloped into shops condos or other commercial uses     both the hershey co and the trust company said monday the fate of hershey’s factory remains undecided     while bilbrey was recognized as the leading contender for the ceo position he was not the only candidate considered     previously bloomberg news reported that the company had held talks with excadbury ceo todd stitzer about the position     however lash speculated that the company’s unique structure with the hershey school trust controlling  percent of the company’s voting shares may have made recruiting an outsider a challenge     in an economy that has seen dramatic changes over the last several years a safe conservative bet is considered a home run at least as far as investors are concerned     “there really isn’t too much to say” russo said “it’s a safe conservative company so the choice fits who they are and what they are” meet the new boss     name john p bilbrey title president ceo of the hershey co salary  million previous chief operating officer the hershey co age  background joined the hershey co in  as president of hershey international previously he held executive positions at mission foods and danone
