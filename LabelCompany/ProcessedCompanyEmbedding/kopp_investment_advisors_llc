allocation retirement or tax planning insurance needs or other financial matters clients must consult their broker lawyer accountant or other financial professional while kia throughout the advisory

appropriate given the client s other assets obligations and financial needs or changes therein kia may serve as a portfolio manager in wrap fee and similar programs sponsored by unaffiliated financial services firms such as investment advisers and brokerdealers generally under a wrap fee program a client of the sponsoring financial institution will be able to obtain professional investment

the client out of the fees it charges to its clients the fee that kia receives generally will be negotiated with the program sponsor and may be affected by the size of the accounts being managed and the nature of the investment objectives being utilized by kia in connection with the program these fees may vary from the schedules of fees set forth in item  below and from program to program fees

available from other sources from time to time kia may negotiate or waive the amount and payment of any management fee kia may also group multiple accounts of one client relationship together for purposes of calculating a negotiated fee clients may authorize kia in the investment management agreement to deduct advisory fees directly from the client s custodial account it is the client s

  methods of analysis investment strategies and risk of loss we offer a range of equity portfolio management styles generally derived from our three primary strategies emerging growth strategy accruhealth strategy and tqm strategy our blend strategies are comprised of accounts incorporating a blend of the primary strategies our emerging opportunities strategy is a subset of our emerging growth strategy each strategy and the material risks associated with each strategy are described below emerging growth strategy kia s emerging growth strategy is an aggressive equity strategy the guidelines for initial construction of the portfolios in this strategy call for up to  of client assets in the account to be invested in emerging growth companies that are expected to experience accelerated earnings growth after the initial step of gathering investment ideas kia narrows its focus by examining company fundamentals company attributes important to kia include  a leading industry position or technologyproduct that will establish leadership in the future projected annual revenue or sales growth of  or greater and projected earnings growth of  or greater significant investment in research and development rd producing new products that will drive future growth a strong financial position including low debt to total capital and management excellence kia believes management is key to the equation kia looks for chief executive officers who have the uncommon ability to balance a visionary scope and practical business sense specifically kia looks for a person with a track record of being successful and a commitment to quality kia believes that good leadership points the way to solid execution and consistent progress toward longterm success emerging growth companies are often in the same or related market sectors subsectors or industries because of market capitalization and ownership concentration these stocks may trade more thinly and may have a more limited public float than established companies in addition the share prices of these stocks may be quite volatile as a result client portfolios may be vulnerable to a less efficient market and to increased stock illiquidity and volatility than that applicable to largecap stocks assets allocated to this style should represent the aggressive equity portion of an overall portfolio a client must be willing to accept high volatility and have no immediate need for liquidity the vast majority of emerging growth company stocks are listed on the nasdaq stock market inc believing that a few good ideas are better than many mediocre ones kia attempts to find investments that can be held for at least three to five years and to minimize portfolio turnover kia will hold positions much longer than is typical in the industry kia does not attempt to time the market accruhealth strategy kia s accruhealth strategy focuses on capital appreciation through investments in emerging growth companies in the health care sector special emphasis will be given to the following subsectors of health care medical devices diagnostics health care information technology life science tools and instruments specialty pharmaceuticals and biotechnology subsector weightings will be determined by the manager s views of areas of opportunity and are subject to change without notice the management of this strategy will utilize a core position management strategy at any point in time the manager may identify a core position as fairly priced undervalued or overvalued the manager will weight the percentage held of a core position in the account based on the common stock s current price versus the manager s perception of the stock s value from time to time the manager may perceive value and invest  in other securities of a company including warrants convertible preferred stock or convertible debt either in addition to or in lieu of direct investments in a company s common stock this strategy is likely to result in higher turnover than the emerging growth strategy in addition accounts in this strategy may utilize exchangetraded funds etfs to gain broad exposure to a sector or subsector nonhealth care stocks will make up a minority percentage of the account at all times accounts may also hold cash in order to retain the flexibility to respond promptly to changes in market and economic conditions tqm strategy kia s tqm strategy is a less aggressive equity strategy and focuses on tqm companies tqm which refers to total quality management is a management philosophy where a company undertakes a systematic process of evaluating its business practices and engages in a continuous effort to improve its operations throughout the organization the guidelines for initial construction of these portfolios call for up to  of client assets in the account to be invested in companies generally included in the sp  index that have implemented tqm as determined by kia kia evaluates company fundamentals to determine the depth and effectiveness of a company s commitment to tqm using a proprietary threepronged scoring methodology first kia scores companies using indicators to represent many of the criteria outlined in the malcolm baldrige national quality award including leadership customer focus and business results the malcolm baldrige national quality award is administered by the national institute of standards and technology an agency of the us department of commerce second kia scores each company using a unique ranking of publicly available information indicating a company s success in implementing qualitybased management techniques third surveys of leading quality experts drive an additional set of scores that kia evaluates kia compiles all of the information to generate a composite quality score for each company individual accounts referred to as tqm core  hold stocks of approximately companies with high composite quality scores relative to their peers the companies are selected from a cross section of economic sectors represented in the sp  index blend strategies kia s emerging blend accounts are a blend of the primary strategies set forth above and are designed to have a slightly lower risk profile than accounts in the emerging growth strategy in addition to emerging growth company stocks to lower risk approximately  of the client assets in these accounts will be invested in common stocks of companies generally included in the sp  index that have implemented tqm as determined by kia in addition to emerging blend accounts kia also offers balanced blend and tqm blend accounts calling for approximately  and  respectively of client assets in these accounts to be invested in companies generally included the sp  index that have implemented tqm as determined by kia individual account and stock percentages are flexible as all portfolios experience unique cash flows and are individually managed with a longterm outlook emerging opportunities strategy kia s emerging opportunities strategy is a subset of the emerging growth strategy and focuses on longterm capital appreciation through investment in emerging growth companies however securities holdings in an account managed pursuant to the emerging opportunities strategy may  be more concentrated in a limited number of smaller capitalization companies these companies may also be concentrated within specific industries or sectors and may be less liquid and subject to greater price volatility additionally kia occasionally has the opportunity on a very limited basis to acquire securities of emerging growth companies made available through initial public offerings ipos private placements of public equity pipes or similar types of registered or unregistered transactions in kia s view securities acquired through these transactions may be appropriate for accounts managed pursuant to its emerging opportunities strategy because these transactions typically involve securities of smaller capitalization companies that are subject to heightened liquidity concerns and greater price volatility types of investments kia primarily offers investment advice on domestic and foreign equity securities that is common stock occasionally etfs may be utilized in client accounts to maintain targeted or broad market exposure this occurs most frequently in connection with clientdirected portfolio management actions such as taxloss harvesting on an infrequent basis kia may invest in warrants preferred stock or corporate debt securities generally of companies within the emerging growth strategy accruhealth strategy and the emerging opportunities strategy typically holdings of securities in client accounts other than common stock have resulted from offerings which include a warrant or other security in addition to common stock this may occur in connection with a pipe or secondary offering at times clients direct kia to hold specific securities these are treated by kia as unsupervised assets kia expresses no opinion on these holdings cash balances are generally invested in money market funds available through the client s custodian occasionally other shortterm investment vehicles are used as an alternative to money market funds these typically include investment company securities mutual funds or etfs risk of loss risk of loss is inherent in any investment in securities past performance does not guarantee future results and there is no guarantee that your investment objectives will be achieved your account may be subject to the following risks management risk kia and its portfolio managers will be delegated the authority to buy and sell securities on your behalf you must rely upon the managers abilities and judgment and upon their investment abilities there is no guarantee that the portfolio managers investment techniques will be successful equity securities risk common stocks and other equity securities generally increase or decrease in value based on the earnings of a company and on general industry and market conditions the value of a company s share price may decline as a result of poor decisions made by management lower demand for the company s services or products or if the company s revenues fall short of expectations there are also risks associated with the stock market overall the stock market may experience periods of turbulence and instability small capitalization company risk investing in securities of small capitalization companies generally involves a higher degree of risk than investing in securities of larger companies the prices of securities of smaller companies are generally more volatile than those of larger  companies they generally will have less market liquidity and they may be more likely to be adversely affected by poor economic or market conditions these risks generally increase as the size of the companies decrease large capitalization company risk larger more established companies may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges such as changes in consumer tastes or innovative smaller competitors also largecap companies are sometimes unable to attain the high growth rates of successful smaller companies especially during extended periods of economic expansion foreign investing risk investments in foreign companies and markets carry a number of economic financial and political considerations that are not associated with the us markets and that could unfavorably affect your account s performance among those risks are greater price volatility weak supervision and regulation of securities exchanges brokers and issuers higher brokerage costs fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and related conversion costs adverse tax consequences and settlement delays etfs risk an investment in an etf generally presents the same primary risks as an investment in a conventional mutual fund ie one that is not exchange traded that has the same investment objective strategies and policies the price of an etf can fluctuate within a wide range and an etf will lose value if the prices of the underlying investments owned by the etf go down like mutual funds etfs are subject to investment advisory transactional operating and other expenses beneficial ownership under the securities exchange act of  the exchange act  in connection with its investments in emerging growth company stocks in the aggregate kia often acquires on behalf of its clients beneficial ownership positions exceeding  of the outstanding securities of an issuer consequently under federal securities laws kia is a frequent filer of statements on schedule g and schedule d which should be consulted for additional information with respect to holdings in an individual company these schedules are available on the sec s edgar database at if kia were to decide or be required for any reason to sell one or more of these positions over a short period of time or in a sustained down market a client s account could suffer a greater loss than might be the case if kia took no significant interest in any particular issuer companies with small market capitalizations and more concentrated ownership are inherently less liquid than large capitalization companies with more diverse ownership from time to time kia and its affiliated persons may invest in the same companies selected for client portfolios and may report their holdings together with shares managed for clients in the same schedule g or schedule d the filing of any such schedule is not an admission that the persons filing are beneficial owners of the shares for purposes of sections   or  of the exchange act kia is a passive longterm institutional investor who together with its affiliated persons expressly disclaims membership in any group under sections  or  of the exchange act kia does not act as an agent of any client to enter into any agreement to act as a group with others for the purpose of acquiring holding or disposing of the securities of an issuer or to gain corporate control or to influence corporate affairs of an issuer  item   disciplinary information there have been no legal or disciplinary events involving kia or any of our employees involving investments or investmentrelated activities or that are otherwise material to a client s evaluation of our advisory business or the integrity of our management item   other financial industry activities and affiliations kia is an independent investment adviser whollyowned by leroy c kopp mr kopp s interest is held indirectly through a revocable business trust for which he currently serves as the sole trustee kia is not affiliated with any other financial services firms item   code of ethics participation or interests in client transactions and personal trading kia maintains a code of ethics the code  which governs all employees and requires them to adhere to the highest standards of business conduct it is kia s policy for each client s interest to come before that of kia and its employees the code addresses kia s policies relating to compliance with laws and regulations conflicts of interest confidentiality gifts and entertainment personal trading and reporting and insider trading and is intended to assist employees in carrying out their duties as fiduciaries to clients neither kia nor persons associated with kia may benefit personally or trade for their own accounts on the basis of material nonpublic information kia requires employees to preclear all personal securities transactions subject to specific exceptions set forth in the code although kia believes the procedures set forth in the code are appropriate to eliminate or mitigate potential conflicts of interest clients should be aware that no set of procedures can anticipate or relieve all potential conflicts a copy of the code is available upon request to kia kia and its affiliated persons may invest corporate foundation and retirement funds as well as employee and related family account assets in the same securities that are purchased for clients as a result clients should be aware that kia may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of its advice in addition for reasons unrelated to the fundamental decision to buy hold or sell a stock proprietary and related investment decisions may not be the same and may be opposite from client trades and may be effected at different times andor prices as a general rule kia employees may not engage in a personal securities transaction with respect to a particular security while any client account has a pending buy or sell order for the same security until the client order is either executed or withdrawn owing to market fluctuations it is possible that proprietary and related accounts may receive a better price in a given security on a given day employee personal trading activities are monitored by kia s chief compliance officer from time to time for their own accounts kia its affiliated persons and employees and their families may invest in unseasoned turnaround or earlystage issuers andor securities considered inappropriate or too speculative for all or some client portfolios such investments may pose a conflict of interest with respect to kia s fiduciary obligations kia its affiliated persons and employees and their families may also invest in the securities of and make charitable contributions to institutions and firms whose directors officers and controlling persons may  also be clients of kia such relationships may pose a conflict of interest between kia s fiduciary obligation and its desire to attract and retain clients item   brokerage practices in the absence of written client direction kia exercises discretion in the selection of brokerdealers  brokers  for the execution of trades in placing brokerage kia s overriding objective is to obtain the best qualitative execution for the managed account in essence this means that kia seeks to execute securities transactions for clients in such a manner that the client s total cost or proceeds in each transaction is the most favorable under the circumstances when evaluating brokers kia considers such factors as the value of the research provided the commission rates charged the ability to negotiate commissions the ability to obtain volume discounts execution capability financial responsibility responsiveness to kia the terms and conditions specified by the client or portfolio manager size of the order and depth and liquidity of the market for the security while kia seeks reasonably competitive commission rates a client may not pay the lowest commission or spread available on any particular transaction kia has adopted procedures to ensure that its duty of best execution is being met kia has adopted a brokerage committee that is comprised of senior portfolio managers trading personnel and kia s chief compliance officer the brokerage committee meets on a quarterly basis and is responsible for monitoring the firm s trading practices and periodically reviewing and evaluating the services provided by brokers and the quality of executions research commission rates and overall brokerage relationships other than in circumstances where a client directs kia to use a certain broker see directed brokerage below when selecting or recommending brokers kia does not consider whether the broker refers clients to kia soft dollar arrangements as permitted by section e of the exchange act kia engages in the longstanding investment management industry practice of paying higher commissions to brokers who provide brokerage and research services than to brokers who do not provide such services if such higher commissions are deemed reasonable in relation to the value of brokerage and research services provided these types of transactions are commonly referred to as soft dollar transactions two different types of research services are typically acquired through these transactions i proprietary research services offered by the broker executing a trade and ii other research services offered by third parties through the executing broker research services that may be obtained by kia through soft dollar transactions include but are not limited to  economic industry or company research reports or investment recommendations subscriptions to financial publications or research data compilations compilations of securities prices earnings dividends and similar data and services of economic and other consultants concerning markets industries securities economic factors and trends these research services enable kia to supplement its own research and analysis used in connection with providing advice to its clients as to the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities the furnishing to clients of analyses and reports and the effecting of securities transactions and performing functions incidental thereto such as clearance and settlement on behalf of clients to the extent that kia uses client transactions to obtain research or other products or services that kia could otherwise purchase for cash kia receives a benefit because we do not have to produce or pay for such research products or services as a result kia may have an incentive to place more trades or pay higher commissions than would otherwise be the case due to our interest in receiving these benefits rather than our client s interest in receiving most favorable execution however kia monitors this potential conflict of interest through its brokerage committee which reviews all trading practices including soft dollar arrangements soft dollar transactions are not effected pursuant to any binding agreement or understanding with any broker regarding a specific dollar amount of commissions to be paid to that broker however kia does in some instances request a particular broker to provide a specific research service which may be proprietary to that firm or produced by a third party and made available by that firm in such instances the broker in agreeing to provide the research service frequently will indicate to kia a specific or minimum amount of commissions which it expects to receive by reason of its provision of the particular research service although kia does not agree to direct a specific or minimum commission amount to a firm in that circumstance kia does maintain an internal procedure to identify those brokers who provide it with research services and the value of such research services and endeavors to direct sufficient commissions to ensure the continued receipt of research services kia feels are useful in managing client accounts research or brokerage products or services provided by brokers may be used by kia in servicing any or all of its clients and such research products or services may not necessarily be used by kia in connection with client accounts which paid commissions to the brokers providing such product or service in recognition of these factors clients may pay higher commissions to brokers than might be charged if a different broker had been selected if in kia s opinion this policy furthers the objective of obtaining best price and execution in addition kia does not modify or reduce its fees based on the amount of brokerage or research services it receives from soft dollar transactions generally the accounts that pay the commissions that may compensate in part for investment research are noninstitutional accounts housed at rbc capital markets llc rbc without client direction of brokerage these noninstitutional accounts may experience potentially inferior trade executions in the event kia obtains products or services on a soft dollar basis for a mixeduse eg for both research and nonresearch purposes kia will make a reasonable allocation of the cost between that portion which is eligible as research and that portion which is not so qualified the portion  eligible as research may be paid for with soft dollars and the noneligible portion will be paid for with kia s own funds this allocation decision may present a conflict of interest to kia because it is deciding how much the firm will pay in cash kia s compliance procedures require that such allocations be made in good faith directed brokerage clients may designate in writing a broker through which securities transactions should be effected for their accounts kia views the designation of a broker by the client as an implicit direction of commissions generated by the client account designation of a broker may cause the client to pay higher transaction fees than otherwise may be available in addition kia may not be authorized under those circumstances to negotiate commissions and may not be able to obtain volume discounts or best execution under these circumstances a disparity in commission charges may exist between the commissions charged to clients who direct kia to use a particular broker and those clients who do not accordingly directed brokerage may cost you more money when a client has directed kia to provide a given amount of commissions to a specific broker in return for the provision of a service by that broker to the client ie a stepout transaction kia will follow directions in such manner as it deems to be consistent with its contractual and legal responsibilities clients should consider the implications of any fiduciary laws including erisa applicable to such clients prior to designating a broker for execution of trades stepout brokerage transactions kia may engage in stepout brokerage transactions subject to best price and execution generally in a stepout transaction kia directs a trade to a broker with an instruction to execute the transaction but stepout a portion of the transaction to a second broker who clears and settles that portion of the trade each broker in a stepout transaction receives a commission based on that portion of the transaction that it clears and settles kia may engage in stepout transactions to satisfy directed brokerage arrangements for its client accounts to pay commissions to brokers who supply research services to kia andor to improve trade execution kia may have an incentive to engage in stepout transactions to generate additional commissions or soft dollars which may create a conflict of interest however kia monitors this potential conflict of interest through its brokerage committee which reviews all trading practices trade allocation and aggregation kia renders investment management advice to clients who may or may not have investment policies or objectives similar to those of other clients decisions as to purchases and sales are made separately for each client account there can be no assurance that a particular investment opportunity that comes to the attention of kia will be allocated in any particular manner in making such decisions certain factors considered by kia include the respective investment objectives and risk tolerance the relative size of portfolio holdings of the same or comparable securities the availability of cash for investment and the size of investment commitments generally held  clients should expect dispersion in investment performance among individual accounts and between any individual account and a composite of individual accounts occasionally kia has the opportunity on a very limited basis to acquire shares sold through ipos pipes or similar types of registered or unregistered transactions kia s policy is to allocate such shares among eligible accounts in its emerging opportunities strategy based on criteria such as available cash existing positions and brokerage restrictions while kia makes investment decisions for each of its client accounts on an individual basis and trades accordingly kia may determine that a securities transaction is in the best interest of more than one account in this situation kia may decide to combine orders for various accounts into a block trade that may be effected either in one transaction or in several discrete transactions over a period of time in the latter case the combined order may be executed at more than one price allocation decisions will be made fairly and equitably as to all clients while commission costs may be generally lower the contemporaneous purchase or sale of the same securities by client accounts could have detrimental effects on accounts as such purchases or sales may affect the price paid or received or the size of the position obtainable by each certain clients may not be included in certain aggregated transactions because of cash availability tax consequences or other factors in addition to avoid potential conflicts of interest kia s policy is generally to not aggregate trades for proprietary and related accounts with those of client accounts cross trades under certain circumstances such as closing an account a change in client asset allocation or a desire to raise cash in an account kia may order the purchase and sale of a security for different accounts on the same day at approximately the same time an account s need to liquidate a stock may necessitate selling a security that is attractive to another client account such coincident trades may be deemed cross trades by regulators kia will not receive any compensation other than our advisory fee in connection with any such trades such trades will be effected only if in kia s judgment the transaction is beneficial to both the client accounts selling the security and the client accounts purchasing the security the ability to effect a cross transaction between client accounts may be a conflict of interest for kia and present a conflicting division of loyalty because it may provide kia with an opportunity to advantage one client over another kia s current intention is for cross transactions to occur if at all on an infrequent basis notwithstanding this disclosure or any potential benefit to clients such transactions do not occur for clients governed by erisa wrap free programs as discussed in item  above kia may be retained under a wrap fee billing arrangement offered by unaffiliated financial services firms such as investment advisers and brokers for example at the request of a client a broker might arrange for retention of kia as investment adviser pay kia s management fee on behalf of the client monitor and evaluate kia s performance execute the client s portfolio transactions without separate commission charge and provide custodial services for the client s assets or provide any combination of these or similar services for an allinclusive fee paid by the client to the broker in evaluating such a billing arrangement a client should recognize that brokerage commissions for the execution of transactions in the client s account by that broker are not negotiated by kia transactions are  effected without separate commissions and a portion of the wrap fee may be considered as a feeinlieuofcommissions the client should also consider that depending upon the level of the wrap fee charged the amount of the portfolio activity in the client s account the custodial trading and execution costs and other factors the wrap fee may or may not exceed the aggregate cost of such services i if they were to be provided separately and ii if kia were free to negotiate commissions and to actively seek best price and execution of transactions for the client s account accounts managed by kia generally have a lower portfolio turnover rate than accounts managed in other investment styles generally kia s advisory fee for a wrap fee account is paid to kia directly by the broker kia does not receive any portion of the broker s remuneration in certain cases the broker may receive a portion of kia s advisory fee the custodial broker will generally act as the broker with respect to transactions placed by kia on the client s behalf and may if permitted by law act as principal or as agent for a wrap fee client while also representing another of its customers in the transaction because the client pays a fee that covers commissions and other trading costs at the custodial broker to avoid redundant expense it is contemplated that kia will place substantially all portfolio trades with or through the custodial broker this fee arrangement may cause kia not to search as actively among other brokers for best execution in addition to transactional charges including commissions on trades placed with other brokers a wrap fee generally does not cover and the client pays separately for among other things bidask spreads oddlot differentials exchange fees transfer taxes and money market fund fees if applicable trade errors as a fiduciary kia has the responsibility to effect trade orders correctly promptly and in the best interests of our clients in the event any error occurs in the handling of any client transactions due to kia s actions or inaction or actions of others kia s policy is to seek to identify and correct any errors as promptly as possible without disadvantaging the client or benefiting kia in any way if the error is the responsibility of kia any client transaction will be corrected and kia will be responsible for any client loss resulting from an inaccurate or erroneous order generally an error resulting in a benefit to a client account which cannot be corrected will inure to the benefit of the client item   review of accounts typically client portfolios are reviewed on an ongoing basis as a matter of practice

there yet evidence points to no with the summer roadtrip season under way drivers are hearing the familiar question “are we there yet” from the backseat of their automobiles the same question is being asked about the stock market as indices are at record highs and returns in the first half of  have been good unlike a summer road trip to a national park campground or cabin the stock market does not have a known destination so it is difficult to identify when the market is at a peak but there are signs to help investors understand where we are in the market cycle as we look at these signs we see potential for additional market upside in the first six months of year the sp  index sp  hit  new alltime highs and increased  small cap stocks as measured by the russell  index russell  hit  new alltime highs and increased  during the same period breaking down the sp ’s yeartodate returns shows that the market returns have been driven more by multiple expansion  priceearnings ratio up  ytd than by earnings revisions declined  ytd or dividends  however this doesn’t mean that earnings growth is weak in fact as noted by factset the total earnings of the sp  are expected to increase  in  over  and another  in  over  if favorable stock market returns were driven only by higher valuations we would be more concerned but with corporate earnings growing at a doubledigit rate this suggests a healthy economic backdrop perhaps the biggest wild card right now is corporate tax reform as us corporate tax rates are among the highest in the developed world us companies typically realize some profits from outside the us reducing their overall effective tax rate somewhat from the estimated rate shown in the chart on the right but a reduction in the us federal corporate tax from the existing  level could lead to higher corporate earnings likely a tailwind for us stock prices also giving us confidence in our positive outlook is the relatively low probability of a recession in the near term admittedly the us is not in the early part of the business cycle as the us has had only two quarters of negative real gdp growth over the last eight years including none in the last three years looking forward however popular measures of recession likelihood from the new york fed and academia put the chance of a recession in the next year at less than  if the likelihood of recession is low and earnings growth is accelerating we believe the odds favor new highs in the equity markets despite a bull market that seems long in the tooth as an old wall street adage says “bull markets don’t die of old age” we believe the market has further room to run but we also need to be mindful of the risks to our positive outlook the us federal reserve has raised interest rates twice already this year and plans to gradually reduce the size of its balance sheet beginning later this year in our view the fed’s actions have been prudent but the fed or other central banks tightening too much or too soon would not be favorable for asset prices other risks to our positive outlook would include escalating global tensions overall we have had a strong start to the year and are pleased to have delivered strong performance for our clients as we enter the second half of the year the signs we monitor suggest the potential for additional gains ahead —dan garofalo  adam engebretson senior
