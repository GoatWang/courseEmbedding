september             peter b andrews craig j springer and david m sborz of andrews  springer llc wilmington delaware attorneys for plaintiff           john l reed ethan h townsend and harrison s carpenter of dla piper llp us wilmington delaware attorneys for defendants           opinion           bouchard c          in  section  was added to the delaware general corporation law dgcl codifying this courts decision in boilermakers local  retirement fund v chevron corp that delaware corporations may adopt bylaws requiring that internal corporate claims be filed exclusively in delaware section b of the dgcl was amended simultaneously to provide that the bylaws of delaware corporations may not contain any provision that would impose liability on a stockholder for the attorneys fees or expenses of the corporation or any other party in connection with an internal corporate claim          about six months later the board of paylocity holding corporation adopted two new bylaws the first is an exclusive forum bylaw that absent the companys consent requires internal corporate claims to be filed in a state or federal court located in delaware the second bylaw is the point of controversy in this action it purports to shift to a stockholder who files an internal corporate claim outside of delaware without the companys consent the attorneys fees and other expenses that the company incurs in connection with such a claim if the stockholder does not obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves the full remedy sought the feeshifting bylaw in other words to trigger the feeshifting bylaw a stockholder must first violate the companys exclusive forum bylaw          in this action a stockholder of paylocity seeks a declaration that the feeshifting bylaw is invalid under sections b and b of the dgcl and asserts that the members of paylocitys board should be liable for breaching their fiduciary duties by adopting the feeshifting bylaw and by failing to disclose certain information when the company publicly disclosed its adoption defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint as unripe because no stockholder has filed or stated an intention to file an internal corporate claim outside of delaware and for failure to state a claim for relief          for the reasons that follow i conclude that plaintiffs claims are ripe for review because the validity of the feeshifting bylaw otherwise may never be subject to judicial review given its deterrent effect i further conclude that plaintiffs challenge under section b states a claim for relief because that statute plainly prohibits any bylaw that purports to shift a corporations litigation expenses to a stockholder in connection with the pursuit of an internal corporate claim without regard to where such a claim is filed plaintiffs remaining two claims will be dismissed because plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the feeshifting bylaw necessarily violates section b which concerns when personal liability for the corporations debts may be imposed on stockholders and because he has failed to plead facts sufficient to warrant a reasonable inference that paylocitys directors acted in bad faith          i background          the facts in this opinion are drawn from the verified class action complaint the complaint and documents incorporated therein          a the parties          defendant paylocity holding corporation a delaware corporation is headquartered in arlington heights illinois paylocity is a cloudbased provider of payroll and human capital management software solutions for mediumsized organizations with between  and   employees its stock is publicly traded on nasdaq          individual defendants steven j sarowitz steven r beauchamp jeffrey t diehl mark h mischler andres d reiner and ronald v waters iii were the six members of paylocitys board of directors when the feeshifting bylaw was adopted sarowitz is the chairman and founder of paylocity plaintiff john solak alleges he has been a paylocity stockholder at all times relevant to the allegations in the complaint          b the legislative response to the atp decision          in may  the delaware supreme court held in atp tour inc v deutscher tennis bund that the board of a delaware nonstock corporation may lawfully adopt a bylaw that shifts all litigation expenses to a plaintiff in intracorporate litigation who does not obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves in substance and amount the full remedy sought concern that this ruling would lead to the adoption of feeshifting bylaws in stock corporations prompted a quick legislative response          within one year of the atp decision the corporation law council of the delaware state bar association proposed legislation to limit atp to its facts and prevent the boards of delaware stock corporations from adopting feeshifting bylaws in an explanatory memo the council expressed concern that such bylaws would deter stockholders from enforcing otherwise meritorious claims the council further commented that permitting fee shifting as a limitation on stockholder litigation would be functionally equivalent to permitting corporate charter or bylaw provisions limiting or eliminating the fiduciary duties of officers and directors  which the council had steadfastly declined to permit  and that delaware courts already have sufficient tools to deter litigation of limited merit without the need for fee shifting bylaws          the legislation the council proposed was signed into law on june   and became effective on august   it amended the dgcl in two ways pertinent to this case first it added section  codifying this courts decision in boilermakers to provide that the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of a delaware corporation may require consistent with applicable jurisdictional requirements that any or all internal corporate claims shall be brought solely and exclusively in any or all of the courts in this state section  defines internal corporate claims to mean claims including claims in the right of the corporation i that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director or officer or stockholder in such capacity or ii as to which this title confers jurisdiction upon the court of chancery second in response to atp the legislation amended section b to provide that bylaws may not contain any provision that would impose liability on a stockholder for the attorneys fees or expenses of the corporation or any other party in connection with an internal corporate claim as defined in §  of this title          c paylocity adopts the feeshifting bylaw          on february   about six months after the amendments to the dgcl enacted in the wake of atp became effective the paylocity board amended its bylaws to add a new article viii it contains two provisions          section  is an exclusiveforum provision it provides that unless the company otherwise consents courts located in delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain specified disputes unless the corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director officer or other employee of the corporation to the corporation or the corporations stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or iv any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine each an action shall be a state or federal court located within the state of delaware a chosen court in all cases subject to the courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants          section  is a feeshifting provision in general terms it shifts the companys litigation expenses including attorneys fees to any stockholder who brings substantially assists or has a direct financial interest in any action in a forum not located in delaware unless the stockholder obtains a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves the full remedy sought  extraforum claims to the fullest extent permitted by law in the to continue reading free

million building flawed software his dilemma fix it or start over by michael fitzgerald write a comment credit company profile company paylocity  inc  rank  headquarters arlington heights il year founded   revenue  million year growth  website paylocitycom you make a big bold bet you bet wrong you mess up now what figuring out when its time to cut your losses is never easy when it involves pushing aside your handpicked team the decision is all the harder thats exactly the bind steve sarowitz the ceo of paylocity was dealing with sarowitzs story began one chilly spring morning in  this was to be the day that saw the transformation of his company from a mere supplier of payroll services to one that sells its own proprietary software when he left his office in suburban chicago the night before he was confident that his new software would be up and running for one of his companys biggest customers a company with more than  employees what sarowitz woke to instead was disaster the data had never fully loaded overnight as a result his customers employees couldnt see their pay stubs when they logged on i was spontaneously combusting says sarowitz soon he was huddling with his project development chief roey benyoseph roey whats going on he asked ive got a thousand people who wont be able to see their paychecks like i promised benyoseph both men recall quickly replied steve we only tested it for a maximum of  people sarowitz couldnt believe his ears ok he hadnt specified the scale he wanted but wasnt it obvious that paylocitys new software program would need to handle more than  employees the company already had several customers with more than  employees why on earth would his development chief have created software that could handle only  when sarowitz set out to create his online payroll software in  he was sure that he and his team could provide a cuttingedge moneysaving new service for his customers the idea was to nibble away at the giants in the industry notably adp nasdaqadp and paychex nasdaqpayx which were pulling in billions of dollars in revenue but hadnt yet succeeded in offering a strong webbased product sarowitz then  had taught himself how to customize software he was reselling for another company called mpay and figured he had the tech knowhow to spearhead his own software project plus he could tap the expertise of benyoseph a friend since college days at the university of illinois whose programming skills had helped paylocity build a web service that worked with mpays system as  progressed however it became clear that sarowitz was asking his development team to produce a product far more ambitious than it had anticipated sarowitz found himself butting heads with the programmers over nearly every detail one of the developers wanted to give direct deposit accounts friendly little names like my checking account and i said thats going to complicate the program says sarowitz  well i like my idea better  sarowitz recalls the developers saying sarowitz shot back youre a developer you know nothing about this industry benyoseph looking back on the experience says sarowitz had unrealistic expectations and frequently demanded more than the team could deliver says benyoseph steve kept changing directions about the only thing sarowitz felt he could control was his morning running routine which he used to clear his head and confide in his running partner tim hendershot a trust officer at a chicago bank if i asked for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch theyd say they couldnt do it sarowitz complained to hendershot at one point says hendershot he vents and i just run along as summer turned into fall sarowitz began to face the facts he had made some bad calls by betting that programmers with limited web experience could create an advanced webbased program he knew too that he had been wrong to assume he was skilled enough to oversee a fullscale software development project while running the rest of the business sarowitz knew he needed to make some big changes in staffing and strategy he deeply wanted his web strategy to succeed but his gut was telling him the project was off course he had just spent  months and more than  million on the project he didnt want to see all that effort and money go down the drain could he replace his team with new software developers to patch up the problems or was it time to cut his losses and pull the plug the decision as it turned out benyoseph too wanted to make changes in early october he came to sarowitz to tell him he wanted out of the project the two agreed that benyoseph would help find his replacement then step down to a programming job to help with the transitionthis time sarowitz wasnt going to make another hiring mistake he retained two recruiting firms and put ads on technology job sites like dicecom he spent three weeks interviewing dozens of candidates he ended up choosing the second person he interviewed chuck cooper who had  years of experience running major software projects at software vendors and at large companies like washington mutual cooper came on board in december  i messed up sarowitz told cooper on his first day on the job and i want you to fix it cooper soon discovered the sixperson development team was split down the middle over how to get the program back on track both camps were wrong he says just as troublesome was the lack of any real process feature lists were often written down on whiteboards or on napkins only to be erased or lost before anyone had a chance to implement them everywhere cooper looked he saw problems the system often crashed and the design left no possibility for creating the simplest of new features like buttons that allow users to choose from a list of options his conclusion junk it all and start over again sarowitz was relieved deep down he knew it was the right decision it was exciting to realize we could have a fresh start sarowitz says that fresh start included replacing most of the software development team including benyoseph who departed on friendly terms and now works as a software architect for a chicago technology firm the five new hires each with plentiful web programming experience soon paid off code development went reasonably smoothly this time coopers team without being asked by sarowitz designed the new system to work for companies with as many as  employees far larger than paylocitys biggest customer it took another year and nearly another  million to develop the new program profits from paylocitys existing payroll processing service continued to foot the bill in late  paylocity started rolling out the new software the first version later named webpay had the usual kinks but coopers team was able to fix them even for its employee customers data transfers took about two to three minutes a whole lot better than the eight hours they took on that dreadful night in  sarowitz says about  percent of paylocitys customers now use its webpay systems the rest have stayed with mpays product which sarowitz continues to resell and support sales growing at  percent a year are now about  million a year one of paylocitys  customers is mansueto ventures parent of inc magazine of course thats still tiny compared with adp and paychex the recession moreover could quickly cast a shadow over paylocitys futurestill the companys success has recently attracted  million in expansion capital from vc firm adams street partners if paylocity had not developed its own technology the firm wouldnt have been interested says adams street partner jeff diehl it tells you a lot about someone when they can admit a mistake recognize a sunk cost and restart the experts weigh in watch for red flags people often fall victim to what i call the sin of arrogance they dont take the necessary steps to make their software project go well and in particular they dont look at whether the people they have are capable of doing a good job you cant just assume they will grow into it there are clear red flags one such flag is failing to set up metrics so you can measure progress a great way to break this pattern is to establish steppingstones smaller pieces of the project that can be done rapidly to force communication about the project jim johnson chairman the standish group boston letting go is never easy the decision to kill a project is very difficult psychologists tell us about escalation of commitment people think something is fixable and that makes it hard for them to kill a project its easier to rationalize continuing something than killing something you think about the sunk costs not only in terms of money but in terms of time  success is right around the corner and companies throw good money after bad money so to pull the plug on it even though it was a costly decision speaks a lot of steve sarowitz as an entrepreneur julio de castro management professor babson college wellesley massachusetts hire slowly fire fast when you are building software its harder than other kinds of goods because it all builds on the same foundation if your base isnt good you have blown it you not only have to redo the product but you have to figure out how to migrate customers to your rewrite its excruciating the biggest lesson you could learn from this is that all the good intentions all the i can do it boss energy  all that doesnt matter if you dont have quality people you have to hire slowly and fire fast sarowitz learned that the hard way michael braun ceo intacct san jose california
