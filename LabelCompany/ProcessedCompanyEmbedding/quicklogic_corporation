would likely be able to discuss more specific design wins in general when the company reports cq results that should drive the beginning of a potentially sustained revenue uptick in the third and fourth quarters of this year from my view the company is ready for revenue in terms of new product maturity design tools and ecosystem partners but it has to execute design engagements to design wins to revenue then broaden its penetration of existing customers and use new business as reference points to penetrate even more new customers so the bottom line the runners are all lined up and we just need to hear the starter’s pistol fire so quicklogic can start showing its investors the money maintain a  stock price target and recommend acquiring shares opportunistically over the next few months first on the stock i maintain the same position and recommend accumulating the stock anywhere in  range prior to cq results in early august as i think quicklogic is poised to start a sustained revenue ramp that should slowly but surely gain momentum and possibly hit an acceleration point sometime in  maintain  stock price target regarding design wins there were two announced via press release in late june both in china and i suspect there are more that the company is not authorized to announce one design win is for a voiceenabled bluetooth headset with a company called qiwo that should start to generate revenue for quicklogic in q it doesn’t look like this deal is going to move the needle a lot in terms of nearterm companywide revenue acceleration but there are a number of interesting dynamics around this that seem to bode well for quicklogic in the market in general the eos s is the host processor in the headset which means it is a critical component that enables the functionality of the device as such the asp should be in the  range which is a very good high margin price point for quicklogic the ultra low power usage of the eos s device was important in this design win the solution utilizes two of quicklogic’s ecosystem partners sensory for voice recognition and ai speech a new partner for word recognition for connection to the ai speech cloudbased digital assistant importantly there was an encouraging quote from the ceo of qiwo “the quicklogic eos s soc provided us the lowest possible power consumption for new voice enabled headsets” and “with its multicore design integrated voice technology and inherent flexibility to address multiple use cases we look forward to incorporating the eos s solution in future wearable and iot designs we believe this strategy will help us accelerate new product development address multiple use cases from a single platform and leverage broad market penetration that qihoo has established in china” so relative to my statement above from my last report regarding the need to penetrate new customers and obtain actual design wins and then translate that into more business on other products with the same customers this is a prime example of what i am looking for quicklogic penetrated the account on the strength of its technology and its ecosystem and impressed the customer enough that they plan to develop other products with quicklogic this is good in and of itself and also good for marketing to other potential customers so it appears the initial design win that should generate initial revenue in cq should ultimately lead to decent business with this customer in general in the large and rapidly growing chinese market this looks like solid tactical execution of quicklogic’s market penetration strategy in general and in china specifically now as investors in quicklogic we need to see more of the same proliferate bottom line this is encouraging news flow i get why it popped the stock the second announced design win is with another chinese company called janyun for a voiceenabled gps smartwatch this design win also utilizes ecosystem partner sensory and looks to be the start of a broader array of business for quicklogic with janyun for various wearable and iot products this is a decent initial product penetration for quicklogic and also comes with nice executive commentary from janyun indicating deeper involvement between the two companies over time similar to the qiwo deal this also represents a nice tactical execution of the broader customer and market penetration strategy in an important region what was most impressive to me is the commentary from janyun regarding how creative it was in utilizing all of the available blocks within the quicklogic eos s systemonchip soc product which is unique in the market compared to straight microcontrollers and this is a very good sign in my view also the ultra low power competitive edge seems to have played a role in this design win as well and appears to validate quicklogic’s arguments on the advantage of its ultra low power consumption of interest the arm cortex mf embedded into the eos s is the core host processor for the smartwatch the flexible fusion engine ffe block is used to process proprietary janyun algorithms at ultra low power while integrated sensory technology is utilized to deliver the voice interface also at ultra low power the onboard efpga block is programmed specifically for janyun as the display driver and gps interface despite the tiny size of the eos s this is a sophisticated overall use of the device and clearly illustrates the systemonchip nature of the device versus competitive and more generic microcontrollers especially the efpga block that is quite unique combined these two design wins and the likelihood of more from both customers are quite encouraging in terms of executing the sales and marketing objectives required to ramp material revenue for quicklogic overall in a steady and consistent manner if quicklogic can maintain a portfolio of design wins at numerous customers meaning multiple products it substantially reduces the risk of “round trip” product cycle revenue on one major product and helps cement a longer term relationship or as investors like to see a sustained competitive advantage at a minimum solid initial penetrations with these two accounts in my view and we will see what kind of revenue ultimately materializes from these two new customers and how “growthy” and sustainable it becomes as i said in my last note as a tiny company at present it will be a challenge for quicklogic to penetrate and serve a multitude of customers from a sales marketing and engineering support perspective not production but success in this endeavor should drive a more diversified and lower risk revenue growth scenario over time compared to a few large smartphone design wins that may or may not sustain themselves over time from model to model i expect to hear about new design engagements but more importantly other design wins on the cq results call in addition to those mentioned above if so that will be important with that said i expect cq revenue guidance to be up sequentially from q but somewhat lackluster with indications of more to come in q q should be a decent uptick with contribution from both eos s and ultra high margin efpga licensing deals  should be a pretty decent year with the potential for revenue acceleration at some point but i don’t expect a vertical maneuver just steady growth but at some point an inflection to accelerated revenue growth as a dozen or more customers begin to ramp multiple products and new customers scale in on another note there was news flow within the past week on the long awaited samsung otcssnlf “gear fit pro” getting fcc approval it appears that it really is coming and maybe soon the new samsung galaxy note  is supposed to be announced in august so maybe in line with that we will see here is a news article on the product samsungs gear fit pro shows up at the fcc  androidheadlinescom assuming quicklogic reports cq results in early august before samsung officially announces the gear fit pro quicklogic may not be able to include potential cq revenue from samsung for this product in its third quarter guidance but may allude to a potentially imminent introduction this is one reason i don’t expect overly enticing cq revenue guidance but i think there really is a solid chance this time that some will show up in q with a full quarter of contribution likely in q along with a bunch of other eos s design wins that are slated for initial revenue in q and new efpga licenses bottom line i think the quicklogic story has some fundamental forward motion that should pick up in terms of pace a bit in the next quarter or two so with that said i’m still on board with quik as a long investment and think we will finally start to see some decent and sustainable appreciation in the stock as the second half of  unfolds – more qweighted i suspect – and into the first half of  assuming new account penetration continues risks the primary downside risks to the quicklogic story and thus quik

quicklogic corporation quik jay deahna longshort equity value growth techsummaryquicklogic is raising money but this time it is offensive not defensivea substantial round of design engagement to production negotiations for eos products is about to unfold and quicklogic wants to be in a stronger financial position for these discussionsrevenue should bump in q and accelerate in q and beyond aided by the new super high margin efpga businessfor shareholders dilution is generally considered a dirty word and an evil concept however for tiny tech companies with compelling and emerging technology with a ripening market winning on the strength of their technology but losing on balance sheet weakness is even worse for about  years i covered the semiconductor capital equipment industry as a sell side equity research analyst and i can tell you that i saw many small cap semiconductor equipment companies fail to convert solid technology evaluations to production business with major customers due to balance sheet weakness or fear of not being able to keep up with a fast ramp despite winning on technology which brings us to quicklogics nasdaqquik current conundrum but let me step back  months last year about this time quicklogic did a secondary offering that could be described as a desperado deal that was predicated on survival the company was a few months away from delivering its initial samples of the eos s device but its real deal design tools for customers were over six months away its ecosystem was not yet at critical mass and the companys longtime ceo was about to step down for health reasons fastforward to this year and the story is quite different as of three or four months ago the company was finally ready to fully engage potential sensor processing customers with readily available silicon quick turn design tools and a critical mass ecosystem additionally the company entered a new line of business which is actually a new market for its original programmable logic technology that is a highmargin technology licensing and royalty business for embedded field programmable gate arrays or more commonly referred to as efpga this new business line has attracted interest from institutional investors and has certainly played a role in the stock price appreciation in quik shares from a low of  when i wrote my first article on quicklogic last november to the  area now at the present time quicklogic is in engagementdesign in mode with a dozen or more wearable and smartphone makers many of whom have only begun to gain serious momentum in the past quarter or so since the real deal design tools and critical mass ecosystem partnerships have been available anticipating that many of these pipeline deals will likely blossom from engagements to design and production wins over the next several months quicklogic management has decided to proactively bite the bullet and strengthen the balance sheet to improve the companys working capital situation to prevent a potential technology win balance sheet loss situation relative to new and potentially compelling business opportunities the company also believes that the efpga opportunity could be larger than originally thought as recently as four months ago and would like to step up rd in that area for future process technology nodes assuming this business ramps it will be a material margin driver and likely a stock multiplevaluation enhancement vehicle possibly more than enough to offset the dilution from the current deal assuming the efpga opportunity wasnt present so i postulate that the money raise this year is offensive in nature into emerging fundamental opportunity within a much more ready for prime time market than the scenario surrounding the defensive deal last year to use a football analogy quicklogic is looking to draft two stud offensive linemen with their first two draft picks to enhance the likelihood of success by their skill players as a new season begins also as a sign that the deal is more offensive or a step up in quality quicklogic has been able to upgrade the lead banker on this deal compared to last year referring back to my semiconductor equipment analogy there are key differences between quicklogic and them they were small companies that manufactured their own machines and serviced them throughout the world large chipmakers were afraid that these companies might not be able to keep up with them in the case of strong production ramps quicklogic is different as it has the huge global foundries to build its chips for them and there is no need for global service i cant imagine a scenario where global foundries couldnt keep up with any potential ramp in demand for quicklogic devices short of working capital for quicklogic quicklogics devices are very small and many of them can fit on one wafer so the real issue for quicklogic is beefing up its working capital it doesnt have to worry about factory expansion or field service with that said as quicklogic grows it will need more sales and engineering staff to engage more customers but that is relatively easy and a good problem to have gear fit pro in my last article i postulated that the top tier smartphone maker fitness wearable that quicklogic has a design win for is likely from samsung otcssnlf and could be called the gear fit pro according to a recent brand name registration in europe quicklogic management stated in its q earnings call in early november that the product would likely be introduced between late december and mobile world congress which was a few weeks ago however there has not yet been an announcement as such all eyes are on the expected samsung galaxy s announcement on march th to see if a next generation gear fit wearable will be announced also we will see if samsung held it back to introduce it at its own event where it will likely get more attention than it would have at mobile world congress on march th a website called wareable wareablecom published an article based on an interview with mark notton samsungs european head of product management mr notton stated that wearables are a key area of focus for samsung and that it plans to launch multiple new devices this year in several wearables categories including smart watches fitness devices and virtual reality among others he believes the new products should be innovative enough that others will follow its lead the article stated these new devices will start to drop ie be introduced in the coming months the article further speculated that new wearables from samsung could be part of the galaxy  introduction it quotes notton regarding the upcoming product introduction next week weve got lots to unveil suggesting more than one new device is in the cards for the event on march th an article in wareable stated that samsung has acknowledged bixby its voice activated digital assistant technology like siri for apple and it is likely to be launched on march th as well the article in wareable suggested it is slated for the gear smart watches and the gear fit fitness devices from samsung so bottom line despite not being introduced at mobile world congress it does appear that the gear fit pro assuming that is the wearable design quicklogic is waiting to ramp is inching closer to a market introduction and could be part of the galaxy s launch on march th if not it seems it will be coming soon thereafter  revenue progression quicklogic management continues to stand by its fairly long held view that it can ramp its revenues towards breakeven by cq with that said the delay in ramping the abovementioned wearable and the likelihood that the new wearable and smartphone business is more likely a fall event than a spring event it does look like more of a backhalf loaded hockey stock revenue growth scenario is taking shape for c as opposed to a somewhat more linear progression at least through the first half it would certainly be nice to see a little more revenue in the first half but a significantly more backhalf loaded revenue growth scenario was always the expectation the skeptic in me would say here we go again same old quicklogic everything gets pushed out and wheres the beef conversely the more pragmatic me thinks that it has only been four months since eos s samples began to be seeded into the market with ready for prime time development tools and a more mature ecosystem including sensory and cywee algorithms in semiconductor time six months or less to get new design wins on new products is pretty darn fast given the timing of the money raise it looks like several design engagements are poised to enter more serious negotiations in terms of potential production orders in the very near future assuming this process starts to unfold as the second quarter plays out i think it is safe to think about a more meaningful revenue ramp starting in q and that would certainly be a positive stock catalyst in the meantime i think it is safe to expect some level of revenue growth in q from the gear fit pro device discussed above that should initiate the process of propelling the new product revenue scenario at quicklogic into more chunky sequential quarterly increases because of customer delays more than execution issue with quicklogic this process would appear to be a quarter behind where i had expected it to be when i wrote my initial article on quicklogic in november it is likely that the money raise was partially catalyzed by this revenue ramp delay but i believe it was driven more by the desire to increase the odds of flipping as much new design activity into production orders as possible early in the eos s life cycle if the revenue ramp is a quarter behind schedule then why is the stock up i think the answer to that is twofold first off despite a delay at samsung the timing of a real sensor processing revenue ramp is getting closer and investors that have been watching the story and biding their time  to avoid dead money but to eventually get in before a ramp  have likely begun to buy the stock i believe this is an institutional concept as much if not more than retail investors secondly and potentially more important in the recent past is the emergence of the efpga business according to a discussion with quicklogic management this new business opportunity has garnered a lot of interest especially among the institutional investor crowd  based on interactions the company has had with investors the potential of the bottom line impact on this business for quicklogic became initially visible when the company provided q guidance revenue was guided up marginally but gross margin was guided to  midpoint from  in q the primary driver of the increased gross margin guidance for q are initial licensing fees for its efpga offering which i estimate to be less than k of revenue in the quarter there are very minimal costs associated with the efpga business outside of future technology node migration that i alluded to earlier and some design assistance i presume the efpga business drives up front licensing fees then after a design enters volume production sometime later it drives unit volumebased royalties assuming quicklogic can get to  million in efpga revenue in  years at a  aftertax margin it could drive about  of eps assuming  million shares at a x pe multiple that would drive  of share price any way you look at it this business will very likely be a margin enhancement vehicle for the overall company and is also likely to be a stockmultiple enhancement driver over the past four months since introduction management is seeing solid interest from customers for the efpga business including its first licensing payment this quarter and investor interest has steadily increased as an aside once quicklogic reaches steady profitability and has more than enough cash flow to fund growth hopefully by late  or in  i think further growth in the efpga business will potentially be a nice cash flow kicker that can be deployed for stock buybacks which in my mind has to be a priority for quicklogic once it hits its stride and generates excess cash flow compared to four months ago prior to the announcement of this new business line this is a dynamic to be incrementally positive about in any analysis on the company especially relative to future margin earnings cash flow and stock multiple potential stock in my last article a few weeks before quicklogic reported its cq results i stated the following my gut feeling is the stock is likely to digest for a little while in the  to  range and exhibit some choppiness but that is really a guesstimate the stock has moved off the bottom and i just dont think quicklogic has super compelling revenue growth guidance in its pocket for q given that this wearable will likely only contribute towards the second half of the quarter or later and any lightness in revenue guidance will likely bring out the liquidity boo birds but as i suggested above other potentially compelling positive news flow could trump those concerns excuse the pun please quicklogic clearly cant control its customers introduction dates but it will continue to focus on penetrating the market and driving new design wins as fast as possible and the initial design win at samsung is certainly a good relationship sign for potentially penetrating its massive smartphone business in the future as such despite the potential for some nearterm choppiness i believe quik shares are on a trajectory to move higher as  unfolds and i reiterate my  stock price target in fact quik shares did trade in a range after the results that indeed included light revenue guidance for q on the samsung gear fit pro pushout but it was a relatively tight  range there is no doubt in my mind that the post q results trading range in quik shares was supported by the other potentially compelling news flow which was the emergence of the efpga business and the tease on future margin potentialimpact to the overall company embedded excuse the pun into the q guidance meaning the  gross margin guidance for q up from  in q on minimal revenue growth however a few weeks ago quik shares surged from  to a high of  over three days on very high volume in the absence of any public news flow the main conclusion for me on this surge is that an institution or two decided to stake out a substantial position in quik wanted it done fast and didnt care if they moved the stock to do it to do it in this manner they must have a pretty compelling upside target price im not a fan of chasing stocks when there are temporary demand surges unfolding conversely i am a fan of buying stocks when there are temporary sell surges in an otherwise uptrend i believe the recently announced secondary offering is driving the sell surge that is technically correcting the recent buy surge i also feel like the samsung gear fit pro introduction is likely coming sooner than later and the start of a potentially meaningful and sustained revenue ramp is also getting closer additionally after the deal prices which is scheduled for wednesday march nd i believe several new investors to quicklogic via the deal are likely to begin building larger positions in the open market as such i recommend using nearterm weakness to accumulate quik shares and i continue to believe quik shares are on a trajectory to move higher as  unfolds and i reiterate my  stock price target risks here is what i said in early february the primary downside risk to the quicklogic story and thus quik shares is failure to execute broadbased new design win penetration with the companys flagship eos s sensor processing device also success in penetrating the market with eos s devices but a delay in timing could drive a need for quicklogic to raise money which may or may not be a dilutive event if it happens well the money raise risk played out as such i reiterate and emphasize the first part of the risk story which is the need or risk associated with converting design engagements to production orders disclosure i amwe are long quik i wrote this

reblogsharetweetsharesunnyvale camarketwire  sep    quicklogic corporation  nasdaq  quik meets connectivity needs for applications such as portable data terminals mobile pointofsale terminals handheld scanners and industrial tablets flexible solution enables oems to aggregate optimal number of uart and secure access module sam controller peripherals to ti sitara sdio interface quicklogic corporation  nasdaq  quik  the innovator in lowpower customer specific standard products cssps is proud to announce the immediate availability of its new orion reference design this csspenabled reference design improves connectivity between the sitara™ arm® cortex™ processors from texas instruments incorporated ti and peripherals based on universal asynchronous receiver transmitter uart and high speed protocol secure access module hsp sam standardsportable data terminals handheld scanners and industrial tablets mobile enterprise products tend to have an excess of lower bandwidth wireless sensor and io connectivity requirements which often go beyond what is typically deployed in smartphones and tablets these uartbased peripherals include g wireless modules highfrequency modules d and d barcode scanners gps modules rs ports irda controllers bluetooth®  modules and more while mobile enterprise product capability is increasing the sitara arm application processors currently being used typically do not offer an appropriate number of uarts for many mobile applicationsmobile pointofsale terminals for products with embedded pointofsale capability merchants are moving to upgrade their systems to ensure worldwide payment compatibility and enhanced security through the adoption of sams commonly used application processors such as sitara arm cortex processors do not have sufficient sam controllers or do not support the emerging hsp standard as a result there is a need for an integrated hsp sam bridge solution to augment the application processors functionality quicklogics orion reference design can be attached to application processorbased systems via a standard sdio connector as a result orion is a very flexible hardware solution that can be connected to most application processor reference designs on the market today and in the future we are very pleased to provide a much needed solution to the mobile enterprise market in the form of our fully systemverified orion reference design said mehul kochar senior business development manager for quicklogic we have purposefully architected orion with flexibility in mind allowing quicklogic to tailor the exact number of uarts and hsp sam controllers used based on oem size and cost requirements rd party compatibility the orion reference design has been verified with a beagleboard based on a sitara arm processor it has been designed to plug into any application processor reference board with a standard sdio connector linux and windows® ce software drivers are available to ease oem integration of the quicklogic solutionavailability the orion reference design as well as the uart and hsp sam proven system blocks are available today for more information please visit
