convicted of racketeering charges  savannahnowcom  savannah morning news     marty bradley father convicted of racketeering charges father and son convicted of racketeering federal court jury acquits five defendants after marathon deliberations posted wednesday march   it started out badly for martin j marty bradley iii on wednesday afternoon as wayne williams federal courtroom deputy read the jurys verdicts it got worse bradley  of coral gables fla was guilty of racketeering and guilty of underlying racketeering offenses resulting from a florida medicaid scheme as the first convictions were read before a hushed courtroom bradleys wife maria burst into tears and was removed other family members and friends also appeared distraught as williams recited the convictions by the time williams finished reading the page verdict form about  minutes later bradley and biomed plus inc his blood products business were in ruins the verdicts  handed down immediately after the lunch recess  came after the seven women and five men on the panel deliberated over the count indictment for almost seven days in virtual silence unlike some juries this one sent almost no requests or questions to the judge after the initial hours of deliberations last thursday prosecutors lead by assistant us attorney james durham contended the defendants schemes snared lifesaving medications for inflated profits and threatened untold patients health and even lives programs that were affected included florida and california medicaid programs the california genetically handicapped persons program for such illnesses as hemophilia and the immune deficiency foundations safety net program which was designed to ensure that hardtoobtain medications were available also jeopardized the government argued were group pharmaceutical organizations and foreign prescription drug markets government officials and defense financial specialist art leach were putting final touches on negotiations on two forfeiture counts in which prosecutors are seeking to recoup not less than the  million they charged were taken from medicaid as a result of the schemes the jury also convicted bradleys father martin j bradley jr  of savannah on the racketeering charge but acquitted him on a count for conspiring to commit racketeering the jury repeatedly found the son guilty then ruled his father not guilty they did convict him on two charges of failing to report foreign financial transactions his son on one such count jurors convicted albert tellechea of miami as well on a conspiracy charge in the florida medicaid scheme the remaining defendants  sara griffin of savannah and jose trespalacios edwin rivera jr marlene caceras and stephen getz all of miami  were acquitted sentencing for the three convicted defendants will be determined following an investigation by probation officers to determine sentencing ranges for each the final word will come from us district judge b avant edenfield the judge rejected pleas by the younger bradleys lawyer roy black and ordered the defendant taken into custody pending sentencing lead government prosecutor james durham opposed continuing bradleys  million pretrial bond telling edenfield the defendant faces decades in prison and had the resources to flee edenfield did allow the elder bradley to remain free on his  million bond after his lawyer alex zipperer argued his clients age and heart problems were a concern if i learned one thing during this trial patients did not come first at biomed money came first edenfield said in considering zipperers request the judge after some hesitation also allowed tellechea to remain free on his  million bond but ordered electronic monitoring for the defendant the judge allowed lawyers for the three convicted defendants  days to file newtrial motions they will have  days after sentencing to file notice of appeal we have substantial issues for appeal black told edenfield black who assumed the lead role for the defense declined comment following the verdicts were very appreciative of the notguilty verdicts said griffins attorney edward tolley of athens we think it restores her credibility in the

might not reach what is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free we’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success we’re here to help about bing ads where does my ad appear your ads could appear on the top or to the right of bing yahoo and msn search results and you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand your targeting both for location and for devices computer mobile and tablet make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer customers visit your site but if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid that would lower your costperclick and help stretch your budget how do i know if bing ads is working view a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats ad clicks the number of times your ad appeared impressions spend average costperclick clickthrough rate average ad position cost per acquisition and conversions you can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing can i run more than one ad yes in fact we encourage it only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see whats working best with your target customers frequently
