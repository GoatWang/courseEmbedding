claren road credit master fund ltd claren road credit opportunities master fund ltd fore multi strategy master fund ltd sola ltd ultra master ltd solus opportunities fund  lp plaintiffs the government development bank for puerto rico defendant v                  opposition to municipalities’ motion for leave of court to file to the honorable court intervening complaint comes now the government development bank for puerto rico “gdb” without submitting itself to the jurisdiction of the court and without waiving its immunity from suit pursuant to the eleventh amendment of the united states constitution and through its undersigned counsel respectfully submits this opposition to the municipalities of san juan’s and carolina’s the “municipalities” motion for leave of court to file intervening complaint in civil action  fab ecf no  the “motion” procedural background this litigation began on april   when plaintiffs filed the complaint which inter alia seeks to enjoin gdb from making payments to creditors “except to the extent the funds must be immediately used to maintain services essential to the public safety of citizens of puerto rico or to pay ordinary course operating expenses of gdb” compl wherefore cl a along case cvfab document  filed  page  of  with the complaint plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order see order to show cause ecf no  memorandum of law in support of plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order ecf no  on april   the commonwealth enacted the puerto rico emergency moratorium and rehabilitation act the “moratorium act” which inter alia created a regulatory scheme for restricting and monitoring certain withdrawals of deposits and transfers of funds from gdb and loans and disbursements by gdb see puerto rico emergency moratorium and rehabilitation act ps  april   as contemplated by the moratorium act on april   governor garcía padilla signed an executive order declaring gdb to be in a state of emergency pursuant to section a of the moratorium act the “executive order” see executive order eo april   at ¶ first on april   gdb filed its opposition to plaintiffs’ tro request and moved to dismiss the complaint see memorandum in opposition to plaintiffs’ motion for temporary restraining order and injunctive relief ecf no  motion to dismiss the complaint or in the alternative for a stay ecf no  among other arguments gdb maintained that it was immune from suit pursuant to the eleventh amendment the court should abstain from hearing the action and the relief sought was precluded by the united states supreme court’s decision in grupo mexicano de desarollo sa v alliance bond fund inc  us   in response to gdb’s filings on april   plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a tro see motion to withdraw plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and to extend time for plaintiffs to respond to defendant’s motion to dismiss ecf no  plaintiffs asserted that the moratorium act and executive order effectively mooted plaintiffs’  the moratorium act and the executive order are attached as exhibit a and exhibit b respectively to the declaration of hugh k murtagh in opposition to plaintiffs’ motion by order to show cause for a temporary restraining order dated april   ecf no   case cvfab document  filed  page  of  request for injunctive relief id ¶  however plaintiffs reserved their right and have since represented that they intend to amend the complaint see id at  n on april   the court entered an order permitting plaintiffs to withdraw the motion for a tro and ordering them to respond to gdb’s motion to dismiss by april   ecf no  that same day the municipalities filed their motion asserting they are entitled to intervene in this action as of right pursuant to fed r civ p a to challenge the injunctive relief plaintiffs sought in their motion for a tro and in the existing complaint motion ¶¶  specifically the municipalities request “leave to file an intervening complaint against the plaintiffs in order to preclude them from attaching monies deposited by municipalities in the gdb which are allegedly the municipalities’ property” id ¶  although the motion refers to a purported “intervening complaint” as “exhibit no ” id ¶  no such intervening complaint or exhibit was included with the motion in the fourteen days since the municipalities filed the motion they have not filed with the court or served on gdb a purported intervening complaint argument the motion must be dismissed for the straightforward reason that the municipalities failed to comply with the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure c a motion to intervene must be accompanied by “a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought” fed r civ p c this is a mandatory requirement see pub citizen v liggett grp inc  fd   st cir  “the language of rule c is mandatory not permissive and the rule sets forth reasonable procedural requirements to insure that claims for intervention are handled in an orderly fashion” accordingly failure to attach a  on april   counsel for gdb called counsel for the municipalities and raised the issue that the motion had no attached proposed intervenor complaint counsel for the municipalities confirmed that no pleading had been filed and offered no specific date as to when the municipalities might do so  case cvfab document  filed  page  of  pleading to a motion to intervene is a sufficient ground for denial of a motion to intervene see pub serv co of nh v patch  fd   n st cir  failure to attach pleading “warrants dismissal of intervention motions” brown v colegio de abogados de pr no civ  jp  wl  at  dpr mar   dismissing motion to intervene as of right for failure to attach required pleading the municipalities plainly failed to comply with rule c while the motion makes mention of a supposed “intervenor complaint” no such complaint accompanied the motion the municipalities’ failure to file a proposed intervening complaint alone requires denial of the motion see fed r civ p c liggett grp  fd at  patch  fd at  n  and their failure to submit a pleading in the fourteen days since only compounds the error see candelariodel moral v ubs fin servs inc of pr  frd    dpr  noting that where an “experienced and resourceful” member of the bar neglected to comply with the mandatory requirements of rule c and does not “even attempt to comply” the court should not excuse such failure and should deny a motion to intervene gdb reserves its right to challenge on substantive grounds any motion to intervene later filed by the municipalities to the extent they file a proposed intervenor complaint at present however gdb notes that the municipalities’ motion appears moot because it challenges injunctive relief that plaintiffs have essentially abandoned by withdrawing their motion for a tro and by stating that they will amend their complaint which currently seeks the same injunctive relief sought in the nowabandoned motion for a tro even assuming the motion is not wholly moot in the absence of the proposed intervenor complaint it is difficult if not impossible to determine whether intervention as of right would be appropriate  case cvfab document  filed  page  of  conclusion wherefore for the reasons set forth above the court should deny the motion we hereby certify that on this date a true and exact copy of the foregoing document has been filed with the clerk of court using the cmecf system which will send notification of such filing to counsel for all
