objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime

college october   a front view of yalecollege and the college chapel daniel bowen  coat of arms of the family of elihu yale after whom the university was named in  early history of yale collegeedit originsedit official seal used by the college and the university yale traces its beginnings to an act for liberty to erect a collegiate school passed by the general court of the colony of connecticut on october   while meeting in new haven the act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for connecticut soon thereafter a group of ten congregational ministers samuel andrew thomas buckingham israel chauncy samuel mather rev james noyes ii son of james noyes james pierpont abraham pierson noadiah russell joseph webb and timothy woodbridge all alumni of harvard met in the study of reverend samuel russell in branford connecticut to pool their books to form the schools library the group led by james pierpont is now known as the founders originally known as the collegiate school the institution opened in the home of its first rector abraham pierson in killingworth now clinton the school moved to saybrook and then wethersfield in  the college moved to new haven connecticut meanwhile there was a rift forming at harvard between its sixth president increase mather and the rest of the harvard clergy whom mather viewed as increasingly liberal ecclesiastically lax and overly broad in church polity the feud caused the mathers to champion the success of the collegiate school in the hope that it would maintain the puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that harvard had not naming and developmentedit in  at the behest of either rector samuel andrew or the colonys governor gurdon saltonstall cotton mather contacted the successful boston born businessman elihu yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college through the persuasion of jeremiah dummer yale who had made a fortune through trade while living in madras as a representative of the east india company donated nine bales of goods which were sold for more than £ a substantial sum at the time cotton mather suggested that the school change its name to yale college the name yale is the anglicised spelling of the welsh toponym iâl from the family estate at plas yn iâl near the village of llandegla denbighshire wales meanwhile a harvard graduate working in england convinced some  prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to yale the  shipment of  books represented the best of modern english literature science philosophy and theology it had a profound effect on intellectuals at yale undergraduate jonathan edwards discovered john lockes works and developed his original theology known as the new divinity in  the rector and six of his friends who had a study group to discuss the new ideas announced that they had given up calvinism become arminians and joined the church of england they were ordained in england and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the anglican faith thomas clapp became president in  and struggled to return the college to calvinist orthodoxy but he did not close the library other students found deist books in the library curriculumedit yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the great awakening and the enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents thomas clap and ezra stiles they were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at yale while dealing with wars student tumults graffiti irrelevance of curricula desperate need for endowment and fights with the connecticut legislature serious american students of theology and divinity particularly in new england regarded hebrew as a classical language along with greek and latin and essential for study of the old testament in the original words the reverend ezra stiles president of the college from  to  brought with him his interest in the hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient biblical texts in their original language as was common in other schools requiring all freshmen to study hebrew in contrast to harvard where only upperclassmen were required to study the language and is responsible for the hebrew phrase אורים ותמים urim and thummim on the yale seal a  graduate of yale stiles came to the college with experience in education having played an integral role in the founding of brown university in addition to having been a minister stiles greatest challenge occurred in july  when hostile british forces occupied new haven and threatened to raze the college however yale graduate edmund fanning secretary to the british general in command of the occupation interceded and the college was saved fanning later was granted an honorary degree lld at  for his efforts first diploma awarded by yale college granted to nathaniel chauncey  studentsedit as the only college in connecticut yale educated the sons of the elite offenses for which students were punished included cardplaying taverngoing destruction of college property and acts of disobedience to college authorities during the period harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps while yale had youth and zeal on its side the emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies open only by invitation which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship literature and politics the first such organizations were debating societies crotonia in  linonia in  and brothers in unity in  th centuryedit woolsey hall in c  the yale report of  was a dogmatic defense of the latin and greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages mathematics and science unlike higher education in europe there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the united states in the competition for students and financial support college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation at the same time they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background the yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum often resulting in a dual track in the decentralized environment of higher education in the united states balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical a group of professors at yale and new haven congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the victorian culture they concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within yet flexible enough to adjust to the isms professionalism materialism individualism and consumerism tempting him from without william graham sumner professor from  to  taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms he bested president noah porter who disliked social science and wanted yale to lock into its traditions of classical education porter objected to sumners use of a textbook by herbert spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students until  the legal name of the university was the president and fellows of yale college in new haven in  under an act passed by the connecticut general assembly yale gained its current and shorter name of yale university sports and debateedit the revolutionary war soldier nathan hale yale  was the prototype of the yale ideal in the early th century a manly yet aristocratic scholar equally wellversed in knowledge and sports and a patriot who regretted that he had but one life to lose for his country western painter frederic remington yale  was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the wild west the fictional turnofthethcentury yale man frank merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice and his fictional successor frank stover in the novel stover at yale  questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body and the alumni as well as the team itself yales fouroared crew team posing with  centennial regatta trophy won at philadelphia along with harvard and princeton yale students rejected elite british concepts about amateurism in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely american such as football the harvard–yale football rivalry began in  between  when harvard and yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates and  the year of the first triangular debate of harvard yale and princeton the rhetoric symbolism and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets there even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches yet the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed one reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner as is the case in sports and that scoring is subjective in addition with late thcentury concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart in – football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of – to solve the problem of serious injuries there was a mood of alarm and mistrust and while the crisis was developing the presidents of harvard yale and princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport president arthur hadley of yale a lawrence lowell of harvard and woodrow wilson of princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries their attempts however were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the intercollegiate athletic association the big three had tried to operate independently of the majority but changes did reduce injuries expansionedit connecticut hall oldest building on the yale campus built between  and  yale expanded gradually establishing the yale school of medicine  yale divinity school  yale law school  yale graduate school of arts and sciences  the sheffield scientific school  and the yale school of fine arts  in  as the college continued to grow under the presidency of timothy dwight v yale college was renamed yale university with the name yale

yale school of public health  the yale school of nursing  the yale school of drama  the yale physician associate program  and the yale school of management  it would also reorganize its relationship with the sheffield scientific school expansion caused controversy about yales new roles noah porter moral philosopher was president from  to  during an age of tremendous expansion in higher education porter resisted the rise of the new research university claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education many of porters contemporaries criticized his administration and historians since have disparaged his leadership levesque argues porter was not a simpleminded reactionary uncritically committed to tradition but a principled and selective conservative he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new rather he sought to apply longestablished ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university richard rummells  watercolor of the yale campus facing north th centuryedit behavioral sciencesedit between  and  philanthropic foundations especially ones connected with the rockefellers contributed about  million to support the yale institute of human relations and the affiliated yerkes laboratories of primate biology the money went toward behavioral science research which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to improve mankind under an informal loosely defined human engineering effort the behavioral scientists at yale led by president james r angell and psychobiologist robert m yerkes tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate then suggest ways to control sexual and social behavior for example yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction ultimately the behavioralscience results disappointed foundation officers who shifted their humanengineering funds toward biological sciences old brick row in  biologyedit slack  compares three groups that conducted biological research at yale during overlapping periods between  and  yale proved important as a site for this research the leaders of these groups were ross granville harrison grace e pickford and g evelyn hutchinson and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists all produced innovative research including the opening of new subfields in embryology endocrinology and ecology respectively over a long period of time harrisons group is shown to have been a classic research school pickfords and hutchinsons were not pickfords group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools hutchinsons example shows that new models for research groups are needed especially for those that include extensive field research medicineedit milton winternitz led the yale school of medicine as its dean from  to  dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in germany he was equally fervent about social medicine and the study of humans in their culture and environment he established the yale system of teaching with few lectures and fewer exams and strengthened the fulltime faculty system he also created the graduatelevel yale school of nursing and the psychiatry department and built numerous new buildings progress toward his plans for an institute of human relations envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind unfortunately lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful antisemitic colleagues drove him to resign facultyedit before world war ii most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few if any jews blacks women or other minorities yale was no exception by  this condition had been altered dramatically as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions history and american studiesedit the american studies program reflected the worldwide anticommunist ideological struggle norman holmes pearson who worked for the office of strategic studies in london during world war ii returned to yale and headed the new american studies program in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty popular among undergraduates the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of american civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose also during the s and s wyoming millionaire william robertson coe made large contributions to the american studies programs at yale university and at the university of wyoming coe was concerned to celebrate the values of the western united states in order to meet the threat of communism womenedit women studied at yale university as early as  in graduatelevel programs at the yale graduate school of arts and sciences in  yale began discussions with its sister school vassar college about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level vassar then allfemale and part of the seven sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the ivy league when the ivy league still only admitted men—tentatively accepted but then declined the invitation both schools introduced coeducation independently in  amy solomon was the first woman to register as a yale undergraduate she was also the first woman at yale to join an undergraduate society st anthony hall the undergraduate class of  was the first class to have women starting from freshman year at the time all undergraduate women were housed in vanderbilt hall at the south end of old campus a decade into coeducation student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit alexander v yale while unsuccessful in the courts the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of yales grievance board and the yale womens center in march  a title ix complaint was filed against yale by students and recent graduates including editors of yales feminist magazine broad recognition alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate in response the university formed a title ix steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct classedit yale like other ivy league schools instituted policies in the early th century designed to maintain the proportion of white protestants from notable families in the student body see numerus clausus and was one of the last of the ivies to eliminate such preferences beginning with the class of  town–gown relationsedit yale has a complicated relationship with its home city for example thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations but city officials who decry yales exemption from local property taxes have long pressed the university to do more to help under president levin yale has financially supported many of new havens efforts to reinvigorate the city evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial still the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy st centuryedit in  yale and peking university pku established a joint undergraduate program in beijing an exchange program allowing yale students to spend a semester living and studying with pku honor students in july  the peking universityyale university program ended due to weak participation in  outgoing yale president rick levin characterized yales institutional priorities first among the nations finest research universities yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education second in our graduate and professional schools as well as in yale college we are committed to the education of leaders president george w bush a yale alumnus criticized the university for the snobbery and intellectual arrogance he encountered as a student there the boston globe wrote that if theres one school that can lay claim to educating the nations top national leaders over the past three decades its yale yale alumni were represented on the democratic or republican ticket in every us presidential election between  and  yaleeducated presidents since the end of the vietnam war

vice president  other yale alumni who made serious bids for the presidency during this period include howard dean  gary hart  and  paul tsongas  pat robertson  and jerry brown    several explanations have been offered for yales representation in national elections since the end of the vietnam war various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at yale since the s and the intellectual influence of reverend william sloane coffin on many of the future candidates yale president richard levin attributes the run to yales focus on creating a laboratory for future leaders an institutional priority that began during the tenure of yale presidents alfred whitney griswold and kingman brewster richard h brodhead former dean of yale college and now president of duke university stated we do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at yale yale historian gaddis smith notes an ethos of organized activity at yale during the th century that led john kerry to lead the yale political unions liberal party george pataki the conservative party and joseph lieberman to manage the yale daily news camille paglia points to a history of networking and elitism it has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school cnn suggests that george w bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the son and grandson of alumni and for a member of a politically influential family new york times correspondent elisabeth bumiller and the atlantic monthly correspondent james fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students faculty and administration which downplays selfinterest and reinforces commitment to others during the  presidential election george h w bush yale  derided michael dukakis for having foreignpolicy views born in harvard yards boutique when challenged on the distinction between dukakis harvard connection and his own yale background he said that unlike harvard yales reputation was so diffuse there isnt a symbol i dont think in the yale situation any symbolism in it and said yale did not share harvards reputation for liberalism and elitism in  howard dean stated in some ways i consider myself separate from the other three yale candidates of  yale changed so much between the class of

by edward s harkness including the yale drama school stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer an athlete a teadrinking socialite and a student who has fallen asleep while reading similarly the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute on the wall of the law school or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette the architect james gamble rogers fauxaged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the middle ages and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages in fact the buildings merely simulate middle ages architecture for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in  one

whom the university was named in  early history of yale collegeedit originsedit official seal used by the college and the university yale traces its beginnings to an act for liberty to erect a collegiate school passed by the general court of the colony of connecticut on october   while meeting in new haven the act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for connecticut soon thereafter a group of ten congregational ministers samuel andrew thomas buckingham israel chauncy samuel mather rev james noyes ii son of james noyes james pierpont abraham pierson noadiah russell joseph webb and timothy woodbridge all alumni of harvard met in the study of reverend samuel russell in branford connecticut to pool their books to form the schools library the group led by james pierpont is now known as the founders originally known as the collegiate school the institution opened in the home of its first rector abraham pierson in killingworth now clinton the school moved to saybrook and then wethersfield in  the college moved to new haven connecticut meanwhile there was a rift forming at harvard between its sixth president increase mather and the rest of the harvard clergy whom mather viewed as increasingly liberal ecclesiastically lax and overly broad in church polity the feud caused the mathers to champion the success of the collegiate school in the hope that it would maintain the puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that harvard had not naming and developmentedit in  at the behest of either rector samuel andrew or the colonys governor gurdon saltonstall cotton mather contacted the successful boston born businessman elihu yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college through the persuasion of jeremiah dummer yale who had made a fortune through trade while living in madras as a representative of the east india company donated nine bales of goods which were sold for more than £ a substantial sum at the time cotton mather suggested that the school change its name to yale college the name yale is the anglicised spelling of the welsh toponym iâl from the family estate at plas yn iâl near the village of llandegla denbighshire wales meanwhile a harvard graduate working in england convinced some  prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to yale the  shipment of  books represented the best of modern english literature science philosophy and theology it had a profound effect on intellectuals at yale undergraduate jonathan edwards discovered john lockes works and developed his original theology known as the new divinity in  the rector and six of his friends who had a study group to discuss the new ideas announced that they had given up calvinism become arminians and joined the church of england they were ordained in england and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the anglican faith thomas clapp became president in  and struggled to return the college to calvinist orthodoxy but he did not close the library other students found deist books in the library curriculumedit yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the great awakening and the enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents thomas clap and ezra stiles they were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at yale while dealing with wars student tumults graffiti irrelevance of curricula desperate need for endowment and fights with the connecticut legislature serious american students of theology and divinity particularly in new england regarded hebrew as a classical language along with greek and latin and essential for study of the old testament in the original words the reverend ezra stiles president of the college from  to  brought with him his interest in the hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient biblical texts in their original language as was common in other schools requiring all freshmen to study hebrew in contrast to harvard where only upperclassmen were required to study the language and is responsible for the hebrew phrase אורים ותמים urim and thummim on the yale seal a  graduate of yale stiles came to the college with experience in education having played an integral role in the founding of brown university in addition to having been a minister stiles greatest challenge occurred in july  when hostile british forces occupied new haven and threatened to raze the college however yale graduate edmund fanning secretary to the british general in command of the occupation interceded and the college was saved fanning later was granted an honorary degree lld at  for his efforts first diploma awarded by yale college granted to nathaniel chauncey  studentsedit as the only college in connecticut yale educated the sons of the elite offenses for which students were punished included cardplaying taverngoing destruction of college property and acts of disobedience to college authorities during the period harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps while yale had youth and zeal on its side the emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies open only by invitation which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship literature and politics the first such organizations were debating societies crotonia in  linonia in  and brothers in unity in  th centuryedit woolsey hall in c  the yale report of  was a dogmatic defense of the latin and greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages mathematics and science unlike higher education in europe there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the united states in the competition for students and financial support college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation at the same time they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background the yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum often resulting in a dual track in the decentralized environment of higher education in the united states balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical a group of professors at yale and new haven congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the victorian culture they concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within yet flexible enough to adjust to the isms professionalism materialism individualism and consumerism tempting him from without william graham sumner professor from  to  taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms he bested president noah porter who disliked social science and wanted yale to lock into its traditions of classical education porter objected to sumners use of a textbook by herbert spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students until  the legal name of the university was the president and fellows of yale college in new haven in  under an act passed by the connecticut general assembly yale gained its current and shorter name of yale university sports and debateedit the revolutionary war soldier nathan hale yale  was the prototype of the yale ideal in the early th century a manly yet aristocratic scholar equally wellversed in knowledge and sports and a patriot who regretted that he had but one life to lose for his country western painter frederic remington yale  was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the wild west the fictional turnofthethcentury yale man frank merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice and his fictional successor frank stover in the novel stover at yale  questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body and the alumni as well as the team itself yales fouroared crew team posing with  centennial regatta trophy won at philadelphia along with harvard and princeton yale students rejected elite british concepts about amateurism in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely american such as football the harvard–yale football rivalry began in  between  when harvard and yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates and  the year of the first triangular debate of harvard yale and princeton the rhetoric symbolism and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets there even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches yet the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed one reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner as is the case in sports and that scoring is subjective in addition with late thcentury concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart in – football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of – to solve the problem of serious injuries there was a mood of alarm and mistrust and while the crisis was developing the presidents of harvard yale and princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport president arthur hadley of yale a lawrence lowell of harvard and woodrow wilson of princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries their attempts however were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the intercollegiate athletic association the big three had tried to operate independently of the majority but changes did reduce injuries expansionedit connecticut hall oldest building on the yale campus built between  and  yale expanded gradually establishing the yale school of medicine  yale divinity school  yale law school  yale graduate school of arts and sciences  the sheffield scientific school  and the yale school of fine arts  in  as the college continued to grow under the presidency of timothy dwight v yale college was renamed yale university with the name yale college subsequently applied to the undergraduate college the university would later add the yale school of music  the yale school of forestry  environmental studies founded by gifford pinchot in  the yale school of public health  the yale school of nursing  the yale school of drama  the yale physician associate program  and the yale school of management  it would also reorganize its relationship with the sheffield scientific school expansion caused controversy about yales new roles noah porter moral philosopher was president from  to  during an age of tremendous expansion in higher education porter resisted the rise of the new research university claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education many of porters contemporaries criticized his administration and historians since have disparaged his leadership levesque argues porter was not a simpleminded reactionary uncritically committed to tradition but a principled and selective conservative he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new rather he sought to apply longestablished ethical and

of yalecollege and the college chapel daniel bowen  coat of arms of the family of elihu yale after whom the university was named in  early history of yale collegeedit originsedit official seal used by the college and the university yale traces its beginnings to an act for liberty to erect a collegiate school passed by the general court of the colony of connecticut on october   while meeting in new haven the act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for connecticut soon thereafter a group of ten congregational ministers samuel andrew thomas buckingham israel chauncy samuel mather rev james noyes ii son of james noyes james pierpont abraham pierson noadiah russell joseph webb and timothy woodbridge all alumni of harvard met in the study of reverend samuel russell in branford connecticut to pool their books to form the schools library the group led by james pierpont is now known as the founders originally known as the collegiate school the institution opened in the home of its first rector abraham pierson in killingworth now clinton the school moved to saybrook and then wethersfield in  the college moved to new haven connecticut meanwhile there was a rift forming at harvard between its sixth president increase mather and the rest of the harvard clergy whom mather viewed as increasingly liberal ecclesiastically lax and overly broad in church polity the feud caused the mathers to champion the success of the collegiate school in the hope that it would maintain the puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that harvard had not naming and developmentedit in  at the behest of either rector samuel andrew or the colonys governor gurdon saltonstall cotton mather contacted the successful boston born businessman elihu yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college through the persuasion of jeremiah dummer yale who had made a fortune through trade while living in madras as a representative of the east india company donated nine bales of goods which were sold for more than £ a substantial sum at the time cotton mather suggested that the school change its name to yale college the name yale is the anglicised spelling of the welsh toponym iâl from the family estate at plas yn iâl near the village of llandegla denbighshire wales meanwhile a harvard graduate working in england convinced some  prominent intellectuals that they should donate books to yale the  shipment of  books represented the best of modern english literature science philosophy and theology it had a profound effect on intellectuals at yale undergraduate jonathan edwards discovered john lockes works and developed his original theology known as the new divinity in  the rector and six of his friends who had a study group to discuss the new ideas announced that they had given up calvinism become arminians and joined the church of england they were ordained in england and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the anglican faith thomas clapp became president in  and struggled to return the college to calvinist orthodoxy but he did not close the library other students found deist books in the library curriculumedit yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the great awakening and the enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents thomas clap and ezra stiles they were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at yale while dealing with wars student tumults graffiti irrelevance of curricula desperate need for endowment and fights with the connecticut legislature serious american students of theology and divinity particularly in new england regarded hebrew as a classical language along with greek and latin and essential for study of the old testament in the original words the reverend ezra stiles president of the college from  to  brought with him his interest in the hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient biblical texts in their original language as was common in other schools requiring all freshmen to study hebrew in contrast to harvard where only upperclassmen were required to study the language and is responsible for the hebrew phrase אורים ותמים urim and thummim on the yale seal a  graduate of yale stiles came to the college with experience in education having played an integral role in the founding of brown university in addition to having been a minister stiles greatest challenge occurred in july  when hostile british forces occupied new haven and threatened to raze the college however yale graduate edmund fanning secretary to the british general in command of the occupation interceded and the college was saved fanning later was granted an honorary degree lld at  for his efforts first diploma awarded by yale college granted to nathaniel chauncey  studentsedit as the only college in connecticut yale educated the sons of the elite offenses for which students were punished included cardplaying taverngoing destruction of college property and acts of disobedience to college authorities during the period harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps while yale had youth and zeal on its side the emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies open only by invitation which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship literature and politics the first such organizations were debating societies crotonia in  linonia in  and brothers in unity in  th centuryedit woolsey hall in c  the yale report of  was a dogmatic defense of the latin and greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages mathematics and science unlike higher education in europe there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the united states in the competition for students and financial support college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation at the same time they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background the yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum often resulting in a dual track in the decentralized environment of higher education in the united states balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical a group of professors at yale and new haven congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the victorian culture they concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within yet flexible enough to adjust to the isms professionalism materialism individualism and consumerism tempting him from without william graham sumner professor from  to  taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms he bested president noah porter who disliked social science and wanted yale to lock into its traditions of classical education porter objected to sumners use of a textbook by herbert spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students until  the legal name of the university was the president and fellows of yale college in new haven in  under an act passed by the connecticut general assembly yale gained its current and shorter name of yale university sports and debateedit the revolutionary war soldier nathan hale yale  was the prototype of the yale ideal in the early th century a manly yet aristocratic scholar equally wellversed in knowledge and sports and a patriot who regretted that he had but one life to lose for his country western painter frederic remington yale  was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the wild west the fictional turnofthethcentury yale man frank merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice and his fictional successor frank stover in the novel stover at yale  questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body and the alumni as well as the team itself yales fouroared crew team posing with  centennial regatta trophy won at philadelphia along with harvard and princeton yale students rejected elite british concepts about amateurism in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely american such as football the harvard–yale football rivalry began in  between  when harvard and yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates and  the year of the first triangular debate of harvard yale and princeton the rhetoric symbolism and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets there even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches yet the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed one reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner as is the case in sports and that scoring is subjective in addition with late thcentury concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart in – football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of – to solve the problem of serious injuries there was a mood of alarm and mistrust and while the crisis was developing the presidents of harvard yale and princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport president arthur hadley of yale a lawrence lowell of harvard and woodrow wilson of princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries their attempts however were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the intercollegiate athletic association the big three had tried to operate independently of the majority but changes did reduce injuries expansionedit connecticut hall oldest building on the yale campus built between  and  yale expanded gradually establishing the yale school of medicine  yale divinity school  yale law school  yale graduate school of arts and sciences  the sheffield scientific school  and the yale school of fine arts  in  as the college continued to grow under the presidency of timothy dwight v yale college was renamed yale university with the name yale college subsequently applied to the undergraduate college the university would later add the yale school of music  the yale school of forestry  environmental studies founded by gifford pinchot in  the yale school of public health  the yale school of nursing  the yale school of drama  the yale physician associate program  and the yale school of management  it would also reorganize its relationship with the sheffield scientific school expansion caused controversy about yales new roles noah porter moral philosopher was president from  to  during an age of tremendous expansion in higher education porter resisted the rise of the new research university claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education many of porters contemporaries criticized his administration and historians since have disparaged his leadership levesque argues porter was not a simpleminded reactionary uncritically committed to tradition but a principled and selective conservative he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new rather he sought to apply longestablished ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university richard rummells  watercolor of the yale campus facing north th centuryedit behavioral sciencesedit between  and  philanthropic foundations especially ones connected with the rockefellers contributed about  million to support the yale institute of human relations and the affiliated yerkes laboratories of primate biology the money went toward behavioral science research which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to improve mankind under an informal loosely defined human engineering effort the behavioral scientists at yale led by president james r angell and psychobiologist robert m yerkes tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate then suggest ways to control sexual and social behavior for example yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction ultimately the behavioralscience results disappointed foundation officers who shifted their humanengineering funds toward biological sciences old brick row in  biologyedit slack  compares three groups that conducted biological research at yale during overlapping periods between  and  yale proved important as a site for this research the leaders of these groups were ross granville harrison grace e pickford and g evelyn hutchinson and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists all produced innovative research including the opening of new subfields in embryology endocrinology and ecology respectively over a long period of time harrisons group is shown to have been a classic research school pickfords and hutchinsons were not pickfords group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools hutchinsons example shows that new models for research groups are needed especially for those that include extensive field research medicineedit milton winternitz led the yale school of medicine as its dean from  to  dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in germany he was equally fervent about social medicine and the study of humans in their culture and environment he established the yale system of teaching with few lectures and fewer exams and strengthened the fulltime faculty system he also created the graduatelevel yale school of nursing and the psychiatry department and built numerous new buildings progress toward his plans for an institute of human relations envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind unfortunately lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful antisemitic colleagues drove him to resign facultyedit before world war ii most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few if any jews blacks women or other minorities yale was no exception by  this condition had been altered dramatically as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions history and american studiesedit the american studies program reflected the worldwide anticommunist ideological struggle norman holmes pearson who worked for the office of strategic studies in london during world war ii returned to yale and headed the new american studies program in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty popular among undergraduates the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of american civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose also during the s and s wyoming millionaire william robertson coe made large contributions to the american studies programs at yale university and at the university of wyoming coe was concerned to celebrate the values of the western united states in order to meet the threat of communism womenedit women studied at yale university as early as  in graduatelevel programs at the yale graduate school of arts and sciences in  yale began discussions with its sister school vassar college about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level vassar then allfemale and part of the seven sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the ivy league when the ivy league still only admitted men—tentatively accepted but then declined the invitation both schools introduced coeducation independently in  amy solomon was the first woman to register as a yale undergraduate she was also the first woman at yale to join an undergraduate society st anthony hall the undergraduate class of  was the first class to have women starting from freshman year at the time all undergraduate women were housed in vanderbilt hall at the south end of old campus a decade into coeducation student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit alexander v yale while unsuccessful in the courts the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of yales grievance board and the yale womens center in march  a title ix complaint was filed against yale by students and recent graduates including editors of yales feminist magazine broad recognition alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate in response the university formed a title ix steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct classedit yale like other ivy league schools instituted policies in the early th century designed to maintain the proportion of white protestants from notable families in the student body see numerus clausus and was one of the last of the ivies to eliminate such preferences beginning with the class of  town–gown relationsedit yale has a complicated relationship with its home city for example thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations but city officials who decry yales exemption from local property taxes have long pressed the university to do more to help under president levin yale has financially supported many of new havens efforts to reinvigorate the city evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial still the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy st centuryedit in  yale and peking university pku established a joint undergraduate program in beijing an exchange program allowing yale students to spend a semester living and studying with pku honor students in july  the peking universityyale university program ended due to weak participation in  outgoing yale president rick levin characterized yales institutional priorities first among the nations finest research universities yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education second in our graduate and professional schools as well as in yale college we are committed to the education of leaders president george w bush a yale alumnus criticized the university for the snobbery and intellectual arrogance he encountered as a student there the boston globe wrote that if theres one school that can lay claim to educating the nations top national leaders over the past three decades its yale yale alumni were represented on the democratic or republican ticket in every us presidential election between  and  yaleeducated presidents since the end of the vietnam war include gerald ford george hw bush bill clinton and george w bush and majorparty nominees during this period include hillary clinton  john kerry  joseph lieberman vice president  and sargent shriver vice president  other yale alumni who made serious bids for the presidency during this period include howard dean  gary hart  and  paul tsongas  pat robertson  and jerry brown    several explanations have been offered for yales representation in national elections since the end of the vietnam war various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at yale since the s and the intellectual influence of reverend william sloane coffin on many of the future candidates yale president richard levin attributes the run to yales focus on creating a laboratory for future leaders an institutional priority that began during the tenure of yale presidents alfred whitney griswold and kingman brewster richard h brodhead former dean of yale college and now president of duke university stated we do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at yale yale historian gaddis smith notes an ethos of organized activity at yale during the th century that led john kerry to lead the yale political unions liberal party george pataki the conservative party and joseph lieberman to manage the yale daily news camille paglia points to a history of networking and elitism it has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school cnn suggests that george w bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the son and grandson of alumni and for a member of a politically influential family new york times correspondent elisabeth bumiller and the atlantic monthly correspondent james fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students faculty and administration which downplays selfinterest and reinforces commitment to others during the  presidential election george h w bush yale  derided michael dukakis for having foreignpolicy views born in harvard yards boutique when challenged on the distinction between dukakis harvard connection and his own yale background he said that unlike harvard yales reputation was so diffuse there isnt a symbol i dont think in the yale situation any symbolism in it and said yale did not share harvards reputation for liberalism and elitism in  howard dean stated in some ways i consider myself separate from the other three yale candidates of  yale changed so much between the class of  and the class
