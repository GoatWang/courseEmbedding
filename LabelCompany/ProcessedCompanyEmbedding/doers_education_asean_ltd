the sale of the selling shareholder shares industry establishments face both internal and external competition because the industry is fairly fragmented with a large number of owner operators competition occurs mainly at a regional level  internal competition is denoted by businesses within the industry that compete on the basis of quality reputation industryspecific knowledge price flexibility and marketing ability because most clients of this industry are in higherlevel positions in their organizations they are typically seeking a highquality educational service with a short duration this fact is influenced not only by the standard of course content but also by the quality of trainers trainers need to be highly knowledgeable and respected in their teaching fields reputation is an important factor and can include both the reputation of the training provider and of the content of the course specific industry knowledge creates another basis of competition between providers for instance a good understanding of a client’s particular industry may give an education provider a competitive advantage over others establishments within this industry also compete on the basis of price although prices may be difficult to compare because of the range of different courses offered in terms of the topics covered the length of the training course and the level of course support before and after training effective marketing strategies can be a point of competition therefore businesses undertake a range of marketing and advertising activities to attract both corporate and individual clients flexibility in terms of course design and scheduling will give establishments within this industry a competitive advantage industry operators provide set courses and customize their training to suit the needs of the client flexibility in the scheduling of courses is important because the vast majority of participants in training offered by this industry are fulltime employees often in seniorlevel positions as a result a number of establishments in this industry offer selfpaced programs or online courses  external competition within the industry is denoted by participants that are facing increasing external competition from other education operators involved in the colleges and universities industry and the forprofit university industry this competition is evident in the large increases in masters of business administration degrees which involve similar content to some of the courses delivered through the business coaching industry industry operators also face competition from internal training and development departments of larger corporations internal training providers benefit from higher knowledge of the workings of the company doers anticipates competition from the local incubators and accelerators in the local asean countries nonetheless the existing providers have a sole focus on providing networking events and workspace sharing and offer very limited training program dr willson has seen a tremendous opportunity in the asean market due to the nascent development of startups in these countries and the wide education gap between the existing workforce and required qualifications by companies doers will thus offer its highquality business education and training program at the new incubators along with the workspaces networking events and other services company description doers education asean ltd doers is a hong kongbased startup incubator that offers shared workspace networking events as well as training education programs doers offers daily and weekly seminars on personal finances for individuals and tailored corporate training curriculum depending on corporate development needs doers has been offering its flagships programs which includes money and you dbs entrepreneurship institute and us bse entrepreneur business school since  founder and president lin weihsien is a renowned corporate trainer in asia who has logged in innumerable speaking engagements in the region the company is now leveraging its highly successful program and initiating an expansion program to launch its startup incubators in emerging and highgrowth association of southeast asian nations asean and countries the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in april  and was formerly known as

offering specially tailored training and education programs as well as shared office space and workspace for students entrepreneurs and corporations in the region the company believes based on the most recent study on asean corporations conducted by the international labour organization wwwiloorg that a number of corporations in asean countries have experienced shortage of qualified highschool and university graduates despite growth of the region since  the company believes as startup communities continue to grow in the region that there is a growing need for training and education programs that prepare the workforce to be highvalue employees equipped not only with technical skills but also equally important leadership business management and other soft skills that doers offers  doers

was incorporated on april   under the laws of the state of delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking including but not limited to selected mergers and acquisitions the company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders the company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the company the combination will normally take the form of a merger stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange in most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company the company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the securities exchange act of    basis of presentation   the summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the company’s unaudited condensed financial statements such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations the results for the period from april   inception to september   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending december     use of estimates   the preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates                cash and cash equivalents     cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less cash and cash equivalents amounted to  as of september       concentration of risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash the company places its cash with high quality banking institutions the company did not have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of september     income taxes   under asc  “income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of september   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration   loss per common share   basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of september   there are no outstanding dilutive securities   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date                level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly   level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   recent accounting pronouncements   on november   fasb issued asuincome taxes the board is issuing this update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the simplification initiative the objective of the simplification initiative is to identify evaluate and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles gaap for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements current gaap requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period the company is still in the process of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard management believes that the impact of this asu to the company’s financial statements would be insignificant   in august  the fasb issued asu no  “statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows” the amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues  debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs  settlement of zerocoupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing  contingent consideration payments made after a business combination proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims  proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies including bankowned  life insurance policies  distributions received from equity method investees  beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle the amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning

the common stock being sold in this offering including “risk factors” and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus   the company   history   doers education asean ltd the company or doers is a hong kongbased startup incubator that offers shared workspace networking events as well as training and education programs doers offers daily and weekly seminars on personal finances for individuals and tailored corporate training curriculum depending on corporate development needs doers has been offering its flagships programs which includes money and you dbs entrepreneurship institute and us bse entrepreneur business school since  founder and president lin weihsien is a renowned corporate trainer in asia who has logged in innumerable speaking engagements in the region the company is now leveraging its highly successful program and initiating an expansion program to launch its startup incubators in emerging and highgrowth association of southeast asian nations asean and countries   the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in april  and was formerly known as collins island acquisition corporation in may  collins island acquisition corporation filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on form  by which it became a public reporting company   in july  the company implemented a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders issuing shares to new shareholders electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors in connection with the change of control the shareholders of the company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the company’s name from collins island acquisition corporation to doers education asean ltd   business   the companys primary objective is to capitalize on what doers believes to be an increase in demand for technical and corporate education in asean countries by offering specially tailored training and education programs as well as shared office space and workspace for students entrepreneurs and corporations in the region   the company believes based on the most recent study on asean corporations conducted by the international labour organization wwwiloorg that a number of corporations in asean countries have experienced shortage of qualified highschool and university graduates despite growth of the region since  the company believes as startup communities continue to grow in the region that there is a growing need for training and education programs that prepare the workforce to be highvalue employees equipped not only with technical skills but also equally important leadership business management and other soft skills that doers offers   risks and uncertainties facing the company   as a development stage company the company has no operating history and has continuously experienced losses since its inception the company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the company’s ability to continue as a going concern that is the company needs to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans as a development stage company management of the company has no prior experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the company and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale   one of the biggest challenges facing the company is the ability to raise adequate capital to hire and train the requisite employment base and lease necessary space for implementation of training and education programs and provision of shared workspace in target communities throughout asean   due to financial constraints the company has to date conducted limited operations if the company were unable to develop strong and reliable sources of funding for staffing and leasing it is unlikely that the company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan moreover the above assumes that the company’s efforts are met with customer satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers neither of which are currently known or guaranteed   due to these and other factors the company’s need for additional capital the company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   trading market   currently there is no trading market for the securities of the company the company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process there can be no assurance that the company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board        table of contents     the offering   the maximum number of shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering is  the offering will terminate twentyfour  months from the date of this prospectus unless earlier terminated by the company   this prospectus relates to the offer and sale of  shares of common stock of doers education asean ltd offered by the holders thereof who are deemed to be statutory underwriters the selling shareholders will offer their shares at a price of  until such time as the shares are quoted on the otc bulletin board and only thereafter at prevailing market or privately negotiated prices in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary brokers transactions privatelynegotiated transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing market if a market should develop   common stock

  proceeds to the company            based on number of shares outstanding as of the date of this prospectus          table of contents     risk factors   a purchase of any shares is an investment in the companys common stock and involves a high degree of risk investors should consider carefully the following information about these risks together with the other information contained in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part before the purchase of any shares if any of the following risks actually occur the business financial condition or results of operations of the company would likely suffer the market price of the common stock would likely decline and investors could lose all or a portion of their investment the company has listed the following risk factors which it believes to be that material to an investment decision in this offering   the company has no independent operating history and as such an investor cannot assess its profitability or performance but must rely on the experience of its president and other officers   the company is a development stage company and has no operating history and it is therefore not possible for an investor to assess prior performance or determine whether it will likely meet its projected business plan such lack of experience may result in the company experiencing difficulty in adequately designing or building any project thereby causing the project to function improperly or provide inadequate utility for which it is intended if the company’s projects cannot be completed or consistently function improperly or perform below expectations the company will likely be unable to market and sell many of its projects or products an investor will be required to make an investment decision based solely on the management’s history and its projected operations in light of the risks expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by operating incubators and offering educational products in asean communities   the company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the companys ability to continue as a going concern   the report of the companys independent auditors contained in the companys financial statements as of september   includes a paragraph that explains that the company has experienced recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit during the development stage of   these matters raise substantial doubt regarding the companys ability to continue as a going concern without the influx of capital through the sale of its securities or through development of its operations   the company has accumulated deficit as of september   of     as of september   the company has an accumulated deficit of  this deficit may impact on the company in various ways including but not limited to making it more difficult to borrow money sell stock or to maintain a good market price   the offering price of the shares has been arbitrarily determined and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair market value of the shares   currently there is no public market for the companys common stock the offering price for the shares has been arbitrarily determined and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets operations book or other established criteria of value of the company thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the shares   reliance on management   management will participate in all decisions with respect to the management of the company including without limitation determining business strategy operations and development in the event of the dissolution death retirement or other incapacity of the management the business and operations of the company may be adversely affected   the company’s ceo controls a majority of the outstanding stock   the ceo of the company currently beneficially owns more than a majority of the company’s outstanding common stock as such he controls most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company’s common stock or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares mr weihsien will retain substantial control over matters requiring approval such as without limitation the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control        table of contents     the company’s business depends on the market recognition of its “doers education asean ltd” brand and if the company is not able to maintain or enhance its brand recognition the business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected   doers believes that the market recognition of its “doers education asean ltd” brand will significantly contribute to the success of its business and the company believes that maintaining and enhancing recognition of this brand is critical to developing and maintaining a competitive advantage doers’ ability to maintain brand recognition depends on a number of factors some of which are beyond the company’s control while the company shall feature systemwide standardized curricula and operation procedures as doers continues to grow it may not be able to maintain the quality and consistency of its educational services and programs particularly for programs developed in foreign territories where management may lack sufficient experience or expertise or where recruitment of necessary educators and other key personnel proves challenging in addition doers may not be successful in further promoting its brand to remain competitive if the company is unable to develop and enhance its brand recognition and increase awareness of the company’s programs or if the company incurs excessive marketing and promotion expenses results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if the company is unable to sustain its brand image it may also be unable to maintain premium pricing over its competitors which may further exacerbate the extent of any adverse effect on results of operations   if the company fails to successfully execute its growth strategies it may not be able to attract students or corporations to enroll in doers programs and obtain significant market share   the success of the company’s business depends primarily on student entrepreneur and corporate collectively “trainees” enrollment in doers training programs and the amount of fees that the company’s trainees are willing to pay therefore the company’s ability to attract trainees to enroll in its programs and utilize shared workspace and office space and the unit prices the company charges per course or per program is critical to the success and growth of the company these in turn will depend on several factors including doers’ ability to successfully execute its growth strategies to develop new programs and enhance existing programs to respond to developments in asean markets and student and employer demands expand doers capacity and geographic reach manage its growth while maintaining the high quality and consistency of its programs and seminars and effectively marketing the company’s programs to a broader base of prospective trainees and respond to competitive pressures while the company’s founder dr willson is a renowned corporate trainer in asia who has logged in innumerable speaking engagements in the region there is no assurance that this experience will translate to the company’s brand or that the company will be able to maintain or increase demand based on its founder’s prior successes and acclaim if the company fails to successfully execute its growth strategies it may not be able to sufficiently attract trainees to enroll in its programs and may have to significantly decrease fees and revenues profitability and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected   no assurance of commercial feasibility   even if the company’s plans and projects are successfully initiated there can be no assurance that such plans and projects will have any commercial success or advantage also there is no assurance that the company’s incubators will perform as intended in the marketplace   investors in the offering may experience immediate dilution of the value of their shares   purchasers of the shares may experience immediate dilution in the value of their shares dilution represents the difference between the price per share paid by investors  and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the offering net tangible book value per share is the net tangible assets of the company total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding thus if at some other time shares had been sold by the company at a price less than the  paid by purchasers of the shares or had been issued by the company for services or as other noncash consideration then the value of such investor shares immediately after purchase would be less than the  purchase price   there has been no prior public market for the company’s common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the shares difficult   no prior public market has existed for the companys securities and the company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop subsequent to this offering the company intends to apply for quotation of its common stock on the otc bulletin board however the company does not know if it will be successful in such application how long such application will take or if successful that a market for the common stock will ever develop or continue on that or any other trading market if for any reason a trading market for the shares does not develop investors may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so   the companys election not to opt out of jobs act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily comparable to other companies   pursuant to the jobs act of  as an emerging growth company the company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the pcaob or the sec the company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies the company as an emerging growth company can adopt the standard for the private company this may make comparison of the companys financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used        table of contents     the company’s stock may be considered a penny stock and any investment in the company’s stock will be considered a highrisk investment and subject to restrictions on marketability   if the shares commence trading the trading price of the companys common stock may be below  per share if the price of the common stock is below such level trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended these rules require additional disclosure by brokerdealers in connection with any trades generally involving any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions such rules require the delivery before any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally institutions for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transactions before sale the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in the company’s common stock which could impact the liquidity of the company’s common stock   little experience in being a public company   the company is an earlystage company and as such has little experience in managing a public company such lack of experience may result in the company experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business further the company may be hampered by lack of experience in addressing the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies if the company’s operating or management abilities consistently perform below expectations the company’s business is unlikely to thrive   the company is an earlystage company with no developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public company require a structured and developed finance and accounting group as a reporting company the company is already subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  however the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive to the company as it develops its business plan services and scope these costs have made and will continue to make some activities more difficult time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel systems and resources   the securities exchange act requires among other things that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the companys business financial condition and results of operations   these rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for the company to obtain director and officer liability insurance if the company is unable to obtain adequate director and officer insurance its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors especially those directors who may be deemed independent will be significantly curtailed   the board of directors could use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the company that may otherwise be beneficial to some shareholders   the company is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal for instance the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders in addition under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock although the company’s board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the company the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or a majority of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock the board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock unless otherwise required by law or otherwise   failure to effectively and efficiently manage the establishment of the company’s incubators across numerous sectors within the asean communities may negatively affect its business and business prospects   the company intends to establish its incubators in large urban asean cities including major cities in indonesia malaysia philippines singapore thailand brunei darussalam vietnam laos myanmar and cambodia while the company intends to develop its incubator to meet projected market demand in each of these sectors doers may not be able to effectively and efficiently establish andor subsequently manage such growth the company may be unable to identify geographic locations with sufficient growth potential to expand its market reach and the company may fail to attract trainees and increase trainee enrollment newly established incubators may compete with existing incubators for trainee enrollment moreover rapid expansion may result in substantial demands on the company’s management instructors operational technological and other resources the company’s planned expansion will also place significant demands on the company to maintain the high quality of the educational services that it shall offer doers cannot assure that it will be able to effectively and efficiently manage the establishment andor subsequent growth of its operations recruit and retain qualified instructors and management personnel or obtain requisite space at costeffective rates in certain regions   if the company fails to effectively and efficiently manage the establishment and expansion of its incubators its business and business prospects may suffer        table of contents     if we are not able to continually tailor the company’s curricula and training materials to market demand and to enhance doers programs to adequately and promptly respond to developments in the asean job market the company’s programs may become less attractive to trainees   new trends in the global economy and rapid developments in the asean community and corresponding job markets may change the type of skills required for asean workers in the marketplace this requires doers to continually develop update and enhance its training programs and course materials and to adapt them to the needs and demands of the respective job markets the company may be unable to update the company’s programs or develop new programs on a costeffective basis and in a timely manner or at all to keep pace with changes in market requirements any inability to track and respond to these changes in a costeffective and timely manner or to tailor its programs to the asean community’s respective job markets would render doers’ training programs  incubators less attractive to students and other potential trainees which may materially and adversely affect the company’s reputation and ability to continue to attract students and cause doers to lose market share   the company may not be able to successfully execute its strategy of establishing incubators in certain asean geographical markets which may have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations and prospects   while the company through its founder  ceo lin weihsien has an established reputation as a corporate trainer in asia and while the company’s leaders possess key market intelligence in the asian corporate education incubator and accelerator market doers as a company does not currently provide any management consulting educational services nor otherwise to the asean geographic region expanding into new geographical markets imposes additional burdens on research systems development sales marketing and general managerial resources as the asean market is large and diverse client trends and demands may vary significantly by region and the company’s experience in certain markets may not be applicable in other areas  regions as a result doers may not be able to leverage its experience to expand into certain target regions in which it intends to conduct business if the company is unable to manage its expansion efforts effectively if doers expansion efforts take longer than planned or if the costs for these efforts exceed expectations the results of operations may be materially and adversely affected   fluctuation in the value of the renminbi or other asean foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on an investor’s investment   the change in value of the renminbi against the us dollar is affected by among other things changes in prc’s political and economic conditions from  until july  the people’s bank of china intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain an exchange rate of approximately rmb  per us dollar on july   the prc government changed this policy and began allowing modest appreciation of the renminbi versus the us dollar under the new policy the renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies this change in policy caused the renminbi to appreciate approximately  against the us dollar over the following three years since reaching a high against the us dollar in july  however the renminbi has traded within a narrow band against the us dollar remaining within  of its july  high but never exceeding it as a consequence the renminbi has fluctuated sharply since july  against other freely traded currencies in tandem with the us dollar for example the renminbi appreciated approximately  against the euro between july  and november  it is difficult to predict how long the current situation may last and when and how it may change again there remains significant international pressure on the prc government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the renminbi against the us dollar   significant revaluation of the renminbi or other currencies in asean may have a material adverse effect on your investment for example to the extent that the company needs to convert us dollars it receives into renminbi for its operations appreciation of the renminbi against the us dollar would have an adverse effect on the renminbi amount the company would receive from the conversion conversely if doers decides to convert its renminbi into us dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on its ordinary shares or shares for other business purposes appreciation of the us dollar against the renminbi would have a negative effect on the us dollar amount available to the company        table of contents     the company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which may cause its operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter this may result in volatility in and adversely affect the price of doers’ training programs and other products  services offered   the company expects to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and results of operations primarily due to seasonal changes in student enrollment historically educational courses tend to have the largest student enrollment cash collection and revenues in the third quarter the company’s expenses however vary significantly and do not necessarily correspond to changes in student enrollment and revenues the company shall make investments in marketing and promotion teacher recruitment and training and program development throughout the year doers expects quarterly fluctuations in its revenues and results of operations and as such these fluctuations could result in volatility and adversely affect the price of the company’s training programs products  services offered as the company’s revenues grows these seasonal fluctuations may become more pronounced   the company faces significant competition in each program it offers and in many geographic markets in which it intends to operate and if doers fails to compete effectively it may not obtain market share and its business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected   the incubatoraccelerator business education market in asean is rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive and the company expects competition in this sector to persist and intensify doers incubator shall face competition in many of the geographic markets in which it intends to operate for example wework already operates globally offering independent office space and events in the form of standalone seminars in regions including the united states israel uk france germany hong kong canada mexico netherlands south korea china india and australia although the company intends to offer more curriculumbased training and in some distinct markets in contrast to wework wework may develop a similar curriculumbased model or expand into doers’ target markets which could detract from the company’s potential trainee enrollment and revenue   the company also shall compete with other national and regional vocational it education service providers and incubators including founder institute which offers training programs tailored towards entrepreneurs founder institute has already obtained market presence in the united states afghanistan argentina australia canada chile china and many more asean countries presence in indonesia philippines thailand vietnam and malaysia doers will have to compete on brand reputation price and quality of training but if unable to adequately compete in these facets the business and revenue may be adversely affected   the company may not be able to obtain leases at premium locations for new training centers or shared workspace at reasonable prices   all of the company’s training centers and shared workspace shall be located on leased premises the company competes with numerous other retailers and training centers for sites in the highly competitive market for retail real estate and some landlords and developers may exclusively grant locations to the company’s competitors as a result doers may not be able to obtain leases on acceptable terms or at all which could adversely affect its business   the company may not be able to obtain additional funds to finance its operations on terms acceptable or at all and if doers does raise funds the value of investment in the company may be negatively impacted   doers’ business operations may require expenditures that exceed its available capital resources although the company currently does not expect that it will incur substantial debt to finance its future growth to the extent that its funding requirements exceeds its financial resources doers will be required to seek additional financing or to defer planned expenditures there is no assurance that the company can obtain additional funds on terms acceptable or at all   in addition if the company raises additional funds by equity financing investors’ equity interest in the company may be diluted if doers raises additional funds by incurring debt obligations it may be subject to various covenants under the relevant debt instruments that may among other things restrict its ability to pay dividends servicing such debt obligations could also be burdensome to its operations if the company fails to service the debt obligations or is unable to comply with the covenants it could be in default under the debt obligations and its liquidity and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected   adverse changes in political and economic policies of asean governments could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of such regions which could reduce the demand for the company’s products and services and materially and adversely affect its competitive position   all of the company’s business operations are anticipated to be conducted in asean and all of the company’s sales shall be made in said regions accordingly doers’ business financial condition results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic political and legal developments in the asean markets the economy in these developing regions differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects including degree of government involvement level of development rate of economic growth control of foreign exchange rates and currency conversion access to financing and allocation of resources        table of contents   for instance the economies in malaysia singapore brunei and other asean countries have been transitioning from planned economies to more marketoriented economies although these and other target markets have grown significantly in the past  years the growth has been uneven geographically among various sectors of the economy and during different periods doers cannot assure investors that these economies will continue to grow or that if there is growth such growth will be steady and uniform or that if there is a slowdown such slowdown will not have a negative effect on business for example the chinese economy which largely impacts the neighboring economies experienced high inflation in the second half of  and the first half of  china’s consumer price index soared  during the six months ended june   as compared to the same period in  to combat inflation and prevent the economy from overheating the prc government adopted a number of tightening macroeconomic measures and monetary policies including increasing interest rates raising statutory reserve rates for banks and controlling bank lending to certain industries or economic sectors however due in part to the impact of the global crisis in financial services and credit markets and other factors china’s yearonyear real gdp growth rate decreased to  in the fourth quarter of  down from the figure of  reached in the second quarter of  as a result beginning in september  among other measures the prc government began to loosen macroeconomic measures and monetary policies by reducing interest rates and decreasing the statutory reserve rates for banks in addition in november  the prc government announced an economic stimulus package in the amount of rmb trillion in the first half of  total bank loans in china reached rmb trillion compared to rmb trillion for the first half of  and rmb trillion for the full year  china’s yearonyear real gdp growth rate fell further to  in the first quarter of  before rebounding to  in the second quarter meanwhile the consumer price index in june  had fallen  compared to june    the company cannot assure investors that the various macroeconomic measures monetary policies and economic stimulus packages adopted by the respective asean countries eg china to guide economic growth and the allocation of resources will be effective in sustaining the fast growth rate of the chinese economy and in turn neighboring economies that may rely on the chinese economy for their respective growth in addition such measures even if they benefit the overall asean economy in the longterm may adversely affect the company if they reduce the disposable income of doers’ trainees or trainee candidates or dampen their willingness to enroll in the company’s programs   intellectual property   the company has not applied for intellectual property or trade secret protection on any aspects of its business the company has no current plans on attempting to obtain patents copyright trademarks andor service marks on any of its solutions and services there can be no assurance that the company can obtain effective protection against unauthorized duplication or the introduction of substantially similar solutions and services   litigation risk   the company does not have any business liability disruption or litigation insurance and any business disruption or litigation the company experiences might result in it incurring substantial costs and diversion of resources   governmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment   the prc government imposes controls on the convertibility of the renminbi into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of

training that addresses the training needs of individuals and corporations alike as an incubator for startup companies doers revenue streams are comprised of  admission fees for the seminars and tuition fees for the business school  rental income from incubator members and booking fees for seminar rooms   key success factors that the company intends to employ to achieve its goals include the following   ● ability to alter goods and services produced in favor of market conditions establishments in this industry must be able to change or adapt the courses offered to suit the needs of attendees for instance recently there has been increased demand for it management training and quality assurance training   ● provision of superior after sales service establishments that provide a higher level of aftersales service have a competitive advantage over those that do not in cementing client relationships   ● developing a strong brand and reputation the perceived value of a company is important for the recruitment of new clients for seminars and workshops   ● being part of a franchising chain new establishments in this industry can benefit from franchising this reduces the costs associated with establishing new courses and maximizes economies of scale   ● access to highly skilled workforce trainers in this industry must have an appropriately high level of skills and experience        table of contents     the market   the business coaching industry has a low level of globalization with all of the larger enterprises being domestically owned the international reach of these enterprises is growing however through the establishment of branches overseas licensing programs to operators and increasing use of distanceeducation methods given the highly fragmented nature of this industry with more than  of establishments being nonemployers the level of domestic ownership of establishments is likely to remain low   key external drivers that the company believes will positively impact the market include the following   ● corporate profit  a large proportion of the industry’s customers are corporations so changes in business sentiment typically influence demand for the industry’s services when corporate profit is low companies are less likely to spend money on nonessential training for their staff corporate profit is expected to increase in  representing a potential opportunity for the industry   ● per capita disposable income  disposable income levels influence individuals who take courses for selffulfillment customers are sensitive to price so an increase in disposable income often leads to increased spending on education and training courses per capita disposable income is expected to increase in    ● households earning more than   demand for the educational services provided by this industry mainly comes from middle and senior managers an increase in the number of people in these positions will increase demand for services a proxy for the number of middle and senior managers is the number of households in highincome groups therefore an increase in the number of wealthy households is expected to raise demand for industry services the number of households earning more than  is expected to increase in    ● nvestor uncertainty  investor uncertainty also known as the fear index controls investor risk investor uncertainty rises during economic downturns with investors becoming risk averse national debt and interest rate worries are continuing to increase uncertainty and reduce demand for industry services investor uncertainty is expected to increase in  representing a potential threat to the industry   ● number of employees  any rise in the number of employees in the united states will expand the potential market base for the industry therefore an increase in the number of employees typically boosts demand for industry services the number of employees is expected to increase in    startup communities in asean   according to the asiapacific forum berlin apfb’s january  report on startup ecosystems in asean member states the startup communities in asean are still in a nascent stage which presents a unique opportunity for the company potentially growing demand in various regions can be characterized as follows   brunei brunei has a small but continually growing startup community backed by

game and the use of soft power to address hidden barriers to entrepreneurship accelerators  incubators in the region include singapore entrepreneurs network monthly meetup founder institute jfdi asia istartup program and fintech   digital education systems in asean   high penetration of digital use in southeast asia is a positive indicator of the region’s readiness for accessing online training materials as of  out of the estimated  million asean population  million are active internet users  million are active social media users and  million are active mobile social media users the company believes the penetration of digital use in asean creates opportunity and demand for digital education systems the company intends to offer to the asean community   education systems in asean   to promote human resource development asean countries have launched the education objective which aims to i achieve universal access to primary education ii develop education networks at various levels within institutions and iii establish research clusters to improve the quality of education throughout the region asean countries present very diverse levels of educational standard institutional development and education policy singapore for example presents a fully internationalized hub of higher education while cambodia’s system of higher education is only  years old   accreditation mechanisms are vital in establishing the basis for a regional labour mobility market the asia pacific accreditation and certification commission apacc one such mechanism has begun harmonizing education and training systems aiming to certify institutions to common shared standards of quality promoting the use of the english language is another key issue within the aec language barriers within member countries and the increasing internationalization of the job market even within each country make englishlanguage fluency ever more necessary   swot analysis   the companys strengths are denoted by founder lin weihsiens  years of experience as an established network industry leader and successful entrepreneur with experience offering educational seminars throughout asia the company also believes the company is strengthened by its recognition of locations in fastgrowing startup communities in asean   the company will have to overcome certain weaknesses particularly with regards to doers limited business management experience in the asean region the company also currently has only a limited number of current staff to deploy and funds will be required to deploy a comprehensive international market expansion   the opportunity for success is ripe as new emerging markets grow and as political stability in asean communities increases perhaps more importantly there are already several existing startup communities with no current training nor education system in place   there is always the threat however that political stabilizing trends in asean communities could reverse or worsen in addition competitors with similar training or educational programs may enter the region and compete with the company   competition   industry establishments face both internal and external competition because the industry is fairly fragmented with a large number of owner operators competition occurs mainly at a regional level     ● internal competition is denoted by businesses within the industry that compete on the basis of quality reputation industryspecific knowledge price flexibility and marketing ability because most clients of this industry are in higherlevel positions in their organizations they are typically seeking a highquality educational service with a short duration this fact is influenced not only by the standard of course content but also by the quality of trainers trainers need to be highly knowledgeable and respected in their teaching fields reputation is an important factor and can include both the reputation of the training provider and of the content of the course specific industry knowledge creates another basis of competition between providers for instance a good understanding of a client’s particular industry may give an education provider a competitive advantage over others   establishments within this industry also compete on the basis of price although prices may be difficult to compare because of the range of different courses offered in terms of the topics covered the length of the training course and the level of course support before and after training        table of contents     effective marketing strategies can be a point of competition therefore businesses undertake a range of marketing and advertising activities to attract both corporate and individual clients   flexibility in terms of course design and scheduling will give establishments within this industry a competitive advantage industry operators provide set courses and customize their training to suit the needs of the client   flexibility in the scheduling of courses is important because the vast majority of participants in training offered by this industry are fulltime employees often in seniorlevel positions as a result a number of establishments in this industry offer selfpaced programs or online courses     ● external competition within the industry is denoted by participants that are facing increasing external competition from other education operators involved in the colleges and universities industry and the forprofit university industry this competition is evident in the large increases in masters of business administration degrees which involve similar content to some of the courses delivered through the business coaching industry industry operators also face competition from internal training and development departments of larger corporations internal training providers benefit from higher knowledge of the workings of the company   doers anticipates competition from the local incubators and accelerators in the local asean countries nonetheless the existing providers have a sole focus on providing networking events and workspace sharing and offer very limited training program dr willson has seen a tremendous opportunity in the asean market due to the nascent development of startups in these countries and the wide education gap between the existing workforce and required qualifications by companies doers will thus offer its highquality business education and training program at the new incubators along with the workspaces networking events and other services   market

under different assumptions or conditions  development stage and capital resources   since its inception the company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning accordingly the

to meet its obligations which it has not been able to accomplish to date and or obtain additional financing from its stockholders andor other third parties  the company does not anticipate that it will generate revenue sufficient to cover its planned operating expenses in the foreseeable future and the company must obtain additional financing in order to develop and implement its business plan

fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date   f table of contents     level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly   level  inputs are

accounting pronouncements   on november   fasb issued asuincome taxes the board is issuing this update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the simplification initiative the objective of the simplification initiative is to identify evaluate and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles gaap for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements current gaap requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period the company is still in the process of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard management believes that the impact of this asu to the company’s financial statements would be insignificant   in august  the fasb issued asu no  “statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows” the amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues  debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs  settlement of zerocoupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing  contingent consideration payments made after a business combination proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims  proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies including bankowned  life insurance policies  distributions received from equity method investees  beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle the amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period the amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable the company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures     f table of contents     in october  the fasb issued asu  “income taxes topic  intraentity transfer of assets other than inventory” which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than

statements   in october  the fasb issued asu  “consolidation topic  interests held through related parties that are under common control” the amendments affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities under common control specifically the amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity the amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted the company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related

formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the securities exchange act of    basis of presentation   the summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the companys financial statements such financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the companys management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements the company has not earned any revenue from operations since inception accordingly the companys activities have been accounted for as those of a development stage enterprise as set forth in asc  development stage entities among the disclosures required by asc  are that the companys financial statements be identified as those of a development stage company and that the statements of operations stockholders equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of the companys inception the company chose december  as its fiscal year end   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less the company did not have cash equivalents as of april     concentration of risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash the company places its cash with high quality banking institutions the company did not have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of april     f   table of contents     collins island acquisition corporation notes to financial statements   income taxes   under asc  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of april   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration   loss per common share   basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of april   there are no outstanding dilutive securities   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly   level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   note   going concern   the company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and has sustained operating losses during the period ended april   the company had a working capital deficit of  and an accumulated deficit of  as of april   the

other sources as may be required   f   table of contents     collins island acquisition corporation notes to financial statements   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above condition raises substantial doubt about the companys ability to do so the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   in order to maintain its current level of operations the company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the sale of its equity however the company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase of its equity if the company is unable to acquire additional working capital it will be required to significantly reduce its current level of operations   note   recent accounting pronouncements   adopted   on june   the fasb issued asu  development stage entities topic  the amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage entity from topic  thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from us gaap in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information on the statements of income cash flows and shareholders equity  label the financial statements as those of a
