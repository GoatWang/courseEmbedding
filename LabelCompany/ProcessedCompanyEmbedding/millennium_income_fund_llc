millennium sued the hamm parties seeking a temporary restraining order and temporary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the hamm parties from making further unauthorized payments to themselves and others while the parties pursued the arbitration required by their partnership agreements arbitration proceeded with the arbitration hearing taking place from july   until july   the arbitrator rendered his award and the award was transmitted to the parties on august   among other things the arbitrator  ordered an accounting of the partnerships expelled dow hamm iii corporation as the

arbitration award the confirmation hearing was set for september   on september   the hamm parties moved for a continuance of the confirmation hearing stating in pertinent part as follows the hamm parties respectfully request a continuance on millenniums application for confirmation of the arbitration award because they intend to prepare and present motions to vacate andor modify the arbitration award pursuant to texas civil practice and remedies code sections  and  these statutes allow applicants to contest arbitration awards within ninety  days of the date the applicant receives a copy of the award although respondents do not anticipate needing ninety  days to properly contest the arbitration award they do request a reasonable amount of time to do so arbitration in this matter was lengthy lasting four  days numerous witnesses testified four  volumes of transcribed testimony were generated and over one thousand  pages of exhibits were introduced respondents contend there are substantial factual and legal errors in the award and would respectfully request thirty  days to properly prepare their motions to contest the arbitration award prior to its being confirmed by this court under section  the trial court denied the hamm parties motion for continuance without specifying grounds on september   the date on which the court also heard millenniums confirmation motion we have no reporters record from the september  confirmation hearing and nothing in our record indicates what the parties and court might have discussed concerning the continuance motion at that hearing the clerks record contains no written objection to confirmation of the award or any motion to vacate or to modify the award filed by the hamm parties at that time of course as their continuance motion indicated neither did the hamm parties file any of the arbitration record at that time at the september  hearing the trial court entered a final judgment confirming the arbitration award and rendered judgment against the hamm parties on october   the hamm parties filed a motion to vacate or modify judgment and arbitration award they also filed the record and exhibits from the arbitration proceeding on the same date millennium responded to the hamm parties motion to vacate or to modify the judgment and award asserting in part that that motion was untimely for having been filed after final judgment confirming the award in their postjudgment motion attacking the judgment and arbitration award the hamm parties did not complain about the trial courts denial of their

vernon  under these provisions confirmation is the default result unless a challenge to the award has been or is being considered see id these provisions thus imply a due order of consideration they contemplate that any motions to vacate to modify or to correct the award must be pending before the court for its consideration or must already have been ruled on at the time that the court considers the motion to confirm see robinson  wells pc v warren  pd   utah   additionally the taa provides that  if the court denies a motion to vacate to modify or to correct an arbitration award it must confirm the award and  if the court grants a motion to modify or to correct an award it must confirm the award as modified or corrected see tex civ prac  remcode ann §§ c c taken together with the section requiring confirmation unless statutory grounds not to do so are shown sections c and c also indicate that motions to modify to vacate and to correct an arbitration award should be heard either before or simultaneously with motions to confirm the award finally both the faa and the taa provide that a judgment confirming or modifying or correcting an arbitration award is a final judgment like any other see  uscs §  the judgment so entered shall have the same force and effect  as and be subject to all the provisions of law relating to a judgment in an action and it may be enforced as if it had been rendered in an action in the court in which it is entered tex civ prac  remcode ann § a providing that when court grants an order confirming modifying or correcting arbitration award court shall enter a judgment or decree conforming to the order and judgment or decree may be enforced in the same manner as any other judgment or decree consequently requiring a trial court to consider a motion filed for the first time after judgment that seeks to vacate to modify or to correct that judgment in effect the hamm parties position because they argue that a trial court would abuse its discretion by not considering such a motion filed at that timecould in certain circumstances interfere with the same judgments enforcement and with the presumption of finality that third parties such as title companies and creditors are entitled to place upon it see martin v hydraulic fishing supply inc  wash  app    pd   wash app forrest j concurring joined by webster acj noting same problems if motion to vacate is considered after judgment confirming arbitration award put simply we doubt that the respective legislative branches intended to require a trial court to consider such a motion when it is filed for the first time during a period that they also expressly designated for the judgments enforcement additionally requiring a court to consider a motion to vacate filed after judgment but before the statutory day or threemonth period expires could also create unique exceptions to the normal rules governing the modification and amendment of judgments by in effect extending a trial courts plenary power to consider postjudgment motions beyond  days in conflict with the procedural rules applicable to all other judgments id  washapp at   pd at  forrest j concurring see texr civ p ba g this would be an odd result indeed for a judgment that by express statutory declaration is to be treated like any other final judgment see  uscs §  tex civ prac  remcode ann § a  the case law the scant case law on the issue conflicts however we conclude that the better reasoned authority supports our reading of the statutes moreover the only texas authority on this issue necessitates todays holding although both the faa and taa allow a party who wishes to challenge an arbitration award a certain period to move to vacate to modify or to correct an arbitration award courts have held that that period of time represents a maximum not an absolute period upon which the challenging party may always rely see the hartbridge  fd   nd cir  holding under faa that party seeking to confirm arbitration award may do so even before expiration of threemonth period in which party challenging award is allowed to move to vacate to modify or to confirm award thus if party moves for confirmation before threemonth period ends other party must raise any challenges then too city of baytown v cl winter inc  swd   texapphouston st dist  writ denied adopting holding and analysis in the hartbridge in case in which taa applied see also clearwater v skyline constr co  washapp    pd   washapp rev denied regarding statutory threemonth period in which to move to vacate arbitration award stating this could be read to mean that  months is the maximum period in which a motion to vacate may be filed not that the month period is available in every situation generally when a motion to confirm an arbitration award is filed within the month period the motion to vacate should also be brought at that time so that the two motions can be heard together citations omitted emphasis in original that is one partys motion to confirm the award puts the other party to his objections to the award then and there even if time remains on the statutory period in which the challenger would otherwise be entitled to move to vacate to modify or to correct the award the hartbridge  fd at  see florasynth inc v pickholz  fd   nd cir describing the holding in the hartbridge as follows on appeal we  held that one partys motion to confirm an arbitration award imposes on the other party an obligation to  move to vacate if he intends to do so cl winter  swd at  quoting the abovereferenced holding of the hartbridge with approval see warren  pd at  concluding that relevant statutory provisions contemplated that motions to vacate to modify or to correct arbitration award be before court when it rules on motion to confirm going a step further at least one federal court has held that if a party moves to confirm the arbitration award then the party opposing the award may not idly stand by allow the award to be confirmed and judgment thereon entered and then move to vacate the award just as though no judgment existed the hartbridge  fd at  some of the limited state authority on the matter concurs that a motion to vacate to modify or to correct an arbitration award must be filed before a judgment confirming the award is entered see warren  pd at  see also clearwater  washapp at   pd at  but see federated servs ins co v estate of norberg  wash app    pd   washapp  martin  washapp at   pd at  once the arbitration award has been confirmed without challenge and final judgment has been rendered thereon the award can be vacated only if the judgment can be vacated and to vacate the judgment an adequate excuse must be shown for not having presented objections to the award when the motion to confirm was heard the hartbridge  fd at  clearwater  washapp at    pd at  although we recognize that there may be situations where filing a motion to vacate is not possible at the time that a motion to confirm is filed we have no way of knowing whether such a situation was present here under texas law we believe that the result reached in the hartbridge is necessitated by cl winter in which this court held that one must assert a motion to vacate to modify or to correct an arbitration award when a motion to confirm is filed regardless of whether the taas day period to challenge the award has expired see id  swd at  otherwise our holding in cl winter has no teeth the requirement that one bring challenges to the arbitration award when a motion to confirm is filed means nothing if one may ignore that requirement with impunity and file a motion to vacate postjudgment with no reasonable explanation for the delay by postsubmission letter briefing the hamm parties rely on two opinions from the first division of the washington court of appeals in which that court held contrary to our holding today see martin  washapp at   pd at  see also estate of norberg  washapp at   pd at  we respectfully decline to follow these opinions in martin for example the court held based on what it interpreted to be conflicting statutory provisions that did not expressly speak to this issue that one could move to vacate to modify or to amend an arbitration award for the first time after judgment confirming the award provided that one did so within the statutory period id  washapp at   pd at  however the martin courts basis for this holding was that in the absence of any provision explicitly providing that a partys rights  are limited by the entry of an order confirming the judgment  we must conclude that the motion to vacate the judgment here was permissible frankly acknowledging that we have no basis for understanding what the legislatures intentions were in establishing this particular statutory scheme concerning the time for filing a motion to vacate and concluding that it was thus constrained to interpret the statute as we have id  washapp at   n   pd at   n  martin was also not a unanimous decision two justices concurred expressly disagreeing with the cited holding and the majority even acknowledged that the concurrence makes an excellent point concerning the inconsistencies among the various provisions of the statute id  washapp at  n   pd at  n  see id  washapp at   pd at  forrest j concurring joined by webster acj the estate of norberg court merely relied on martin see  washapp at   pd at  we respectfully disagree with martin and estate of norberg first for the reasons detailed above we conclude that the faa and especially the taa imply a due order of consideration second and also as discussed above we agree instead with  the concerns that justice forrest raised in his concurring opinion in martin an arbitration award that is confirmed pursuant to wash stat ann art  is entered as a judgment of the court and has the same force and effect in all respects as and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to any other civil judgment the majority rule creates a judgment unlike any other in that it creates the anomaly of permitting in effect an appeal from a judgment more than  days after it has become final after confirmation of the award not only is the judgment creditor entitled to institute garnishment or execution proceedings but third parties such as title companies and credit bureaus are entitled to rely on the unappealed judgment i find that the majoritys result is inconsistent with the policy of the finality and integrity of judgments i see no reason to believe that the legislature intended this unique exception to the normal rules governing the modification and amendment of judgments indeed it is arguable although not argued that the majoritys interpretation of wash stat ann art  results in an encroachment on the rule making authority of the supreme court as interpreted it is if not in conflict with at least inconsistent with the civil rules as to judgments including  new trial reconsideration and amendment of judgments  relief from judgment or order and  time allowed to file notice such a result is not required by the language of the statute and should be avoided id  washapp at   pd at  forrest j concurring citations and footnotes omitted we further agree with the reasoning given by the utah supreme court in reaching the conclusion that we do today this construction is further confirmed by the provision directing entry of a conforming judgment or decree upon granting of an order confirming modifying correcting or vacating an award since that direction apparently contemplates that the court would consider such motions together rather than in succession otherwise the procedures hearings and action of the court in the motion to confirm could be held for naught and the whole process repeated we do not readily infer a legislative intent to squander scarce judicial time in this manner this construction facilitates the limited scope of review and the considerations of finality sought to be served by our policies on judicial review of arbitration awards warren  pd at  emphasis added this reasoning applies in texas because here as elsewhere  the bases for reviewing an arbitration award are limited  the statute provides for expedited consideration of motions to confirm to vacate to modify and to correct an arbitration award and  parties generally agree to arbitrate for the benefit of a speedy final resolution of their dispute the texas policy of expediting arbitration matters is not promoted by allowing a party to seek a doover at a later date of an award that  has already been confirmed that has been made final and enforceable by statute and that could have been challenged on the same grounds before confirmation  an analogy because a statute makes a judgment confirming an arbitration award final and enforceable like any other judgment our conclusion is further supported by analogous authority concerning affirmative defenses an affirmative defense seeks to establish an independent reason that the plaintiff should not recover and is thus a defense of avoidance rather than a defense in denial that is it is a defense of confession and avoidance in re cm  swd   texapphouston st dist  no pet great am prods v permabond intl  swd   texappaustin  pet denied the statutory grounds for vacating modifying or correcting an arbitration award under either statute are in the nature of affirmative defenses because the party asserting these grounds implicitly confesses the existence of an arbitration award but nonetheless seeks to avoid its effect by asserting an independent reason that the award should not be enforced like rule of civil procedure  which expressly requires prejudgment pleading of affirmative defenses and matters constituting an avoidance in other contexts the faa and taa also contemplate as discussed above a due order of pleading with respect to motions to confirm to vacate to modify or to correct requiring a party challenging an award to raise its challenge before final judgment this requirement makes sense given that the statutory grounds for vacatur modification and correction are matters  like those governed by analogy by rule   of confession and avoidance an affirmative defense that is not pleaded or proved and on which findings are not obtained is waived and cannot be preserved by raising the affirmative defense for the first time in a motion for new trial in re cm  swd at  tien tao assn inc v kingsbridge park cmty assn  swd   tex apphouston st dist  no pet see glover v state  tex crim   swd    a litigant is not permitted during a trial on the merits to remain silent as to affirmative defenses known to him and then when an adverse result is reached on motion for new trial complain because of his own neglect texr civ p  likewise a trial court cannot abuse its discretion in overruling a motion for new trial raising an untimely affirmative defense cf id by analogy then a party that moves to vacate to modify or to correct an arbitration award and adduces evidence in support only after the award has been confirmed and final judgment rendered has waived that challenge  or at least a trial court does not abuse its discretion if it overrules such a postjudgment motion cf in re cm  swd at  this analogy to the law of affirmative defenses is particularly appropriate given that both the faa and the taa contemplate that a judgment confirming or modifying or correcting an arbitration award is final and enforceable like any other see  uscs §  tex civ prac  remcode ann § a if a judgment confirming an arbitration award is final like any other then as it is required to do with any other judgment a party must raise and prove if evidence is necessary its confessionandavoidance defenses before judgment   application of the above law to the facts here the record does not show that the hamm parties challenged the arbitration award on the merits until after the award was confirmed and final judgment rendered in its written response to the hamm parties motion to vacate or to modify millennium argued citing the hartbridge and cl winter that the hamm parties had filed their motion too late and that the motion should be overruled for that reason we agree with this proposition a motion to vacate to modify or to correct an arbitration award must be raised or considered before or simultaneously with a motion to confirm the award see the hartbridge  fd at  warren  pd at  cf cl winter  swd at  the hamm parties did not do this by postsubmission letter briefing the hamm parties argue that their postjudgment motion to vacate was in effect rendered timely by the filing of their prejudgment unverified motion for continuance which informed the trial court of their intent to file a motion to vacate likewise by postsubmission amended brief the hamm parties have assigned error to the trial courts denial of their continuance motion case law indicates that once an arbitration award has been confirmed without challenge and final judgment has been rendered the award can be vacated only if the judgment can be vacated and to vacate the judgment an adequate excuse must be shown for not having presented objections to the award when the motion to confirm was heard the hartbridge  fd at  see clearwater  washapp at   pd at  we review a ruling on a motion for continuance for abuse of discretionsee bmc software  belgium nv v marchand  swd   tex thomas james assocs inc v owens  swd   texappdallas  no pet so holding with respect to continuance motion made in conjunction with motions to confirm and to vacate arbitration award a trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is so arbitrary and unreasonable that it amounts to a clear and prejudicial error of law marchand  swd at  here the hamm parties continuance motion was not verified or accompanied by affidavit contrary to rule see texr civ p   nor shall any continuance be granted except for sufficient cause supported by affidavit or by consent of the parties or by operation of law for this reason alone the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the continuance motion see villegas v carter  swd   tex  generally when movants fail to comply with texr civ p s requirement that the motion for continuance be supported by affidavit we presume that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion cf n state constr co v banchero  washd    pd    holding that trial court did not abuse discretion in denying motion to continue hearing to confirm and to vacate arbitration award when continuance was sought for preparation of statement of facts from arbitration proceeding when continuance motion did not comply with statute requiring such motion to be supported by affidavit showing materiality of soughtafter evidence and due diligence additionally their continuance motion neither explained on which statutory grounds for vacating or modifying they might rely nor explained how the arbitration materials for which they needed the continuance were relevant and material to those grounds  even though the counsel who filed the continuance motion also represented the hamm parties at arbitration cf banchero  washd at   pd at  appellants were in a good position to comply with all of these requirements of supporting their continuance motion with affidavit showing materiality of sought  after evidence among other matters as they were or should have been familiar with the evidence presented to the board of arbitrators this is important because  the trial court already had the arbitration agreement millenniums arbitration demand filed with the american arbitration association and the  arbitration award before it by virtue of previously filed pleadings and motions and  some statutory grounds for vacating or modifying arbitration awards based on legal errors as the hamm parties alleged in part do not necessarily require the filing of more than these documents see tex civ prac  remcode ann § a providing for vacating award if arbitrators exceeded their authority id § a providing for modifying or correcting award if it contains evident miscalculation of numbers or evident mistake in description of person thing or property to which award refers arbitrators made award with respect to matter not submitted to them and award may be corrected without affecting decisions merits or awards form is imperfect in manner not affecting merits see crossmark inc v hazar  swd   texappdallas  no pet applications to confirm or vacate an arbitration award should be decided as other motions in civil cases on notice and an evidentiary hearing if necessary emphasis added moreover we have no idea what if anything was discussed concerning the continuance motion at the september  hearing because we have no record of that hearing neither did the hamm parties ask the court to revisit its continuance ruling at the time that they filed their postjudgment motion to vacate the judgment and award or explain then why the record for which they sought a continuance was essential to the bases for their motion to vacate given this record we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the hamm parties continuance motion  the record finally even if we were to reach the merits of the hamm parties posttrial motion it is not at all clear that we could consider the arbitration record and exhibits filed in support first the arbitration record and exhibits were not introduced into evidence at the postjudgment hearing the hamm parties did not expressly or specifically refer to them in their postjudgment motion to vacate or to modify nothing shows that the trial court considered the arbitration record and exhibits at the hearing on the hamm parties postjudgment motion and the arbitration materials like the postjudgment motion in support of which they were produced were not filed before final judgment given these circumstances nothing shows that the trial court considered the arbitration record and exhibits when it ruled on the hamm parties postjudgment motion see state v one   nissan auto vin jnhzsgx  swd   texappel paso  no writ holding that letter that was included in clerks record but that was not admitted into evidence and that did not appear to have been considered by trial court could not be considered on appeal overruled on other grounds sub nom state v   swd  tex indeed the  trial court would not have abused its discretion in overruling the hamm parties postjudgment motion even without first considering the arbitration record and exhibits because the hamm parties had untimely filed both that motion and their supporting documentation simply put nothing requires a court to consider materials relevant to vacating an arbitration award when those materials are filed along with an untimely motion to vacate and insufficient explanation is offered for the delay second the arbitration materials were not before the trial court at the time that it confirmed the award and rendered final judgment  in effect the only ruling that we may review on the merits because the motion to vacate or to modify was untimely  and we may generally not evaluate a trial courts rulings based on materials that were not before it at the time that it ruled see eg methodist hosps of dallas v tall  swd   texappcorpus christi  no pet it is axiomatic that an appellate court reviews actions of a trial court based on the materials before the trial court at the time it acted conclusion the trial court had no discretion but to confirm the arbitration award if the hamm parties did not file a motion to vacate or to modify or otherwise challenge in any way the award before the ruling on millenniums motion to confirm see tex civ prac  remcode ann §  the hamm parties did not do so the trial court was entitled summarily to deny the hamm parties untimely postjudgment motion to vacate or to modify and did not have to consider the untimely materials filed in support of that motion for these reasons and the reasons stated above we overrule each of the hamm parties issues and affirm the judgment of the trial court notes  many of the factual statements in the parties briefs come from the arbitration record contained in the fourth supplemental clerks record which for the reasons discussed below it is not clear that we may consider on appeal our factual discussion thus includes only those matters shown by other portions of the reporters and clerks records  the appellate record did not contain the hamm parties motion for continuance until they supplemented the record with that motion after oral argument in this cause  the parties arbitration agreement provided that the federal arbitration act faa would apply to arbitration of their disputes although the agreement did not expressly mention whether the faa applied to confirmation of the award see  uscs §§  west   supp the parties moved for confirmation of and for vacatur or modification of the arbitration award under the texas general arbitration act taa see tex civ prac  remcode ann §§  vernon  however on appeal they assert that the faa applies to the merits of the rulings granting the motion to confirm and denying the motion to vacate or to modify the arbitration award parties may validly contract for application of the faa see in re kellogg brown  root  swd   texapphouston st dist  orig proceeding however we also note that texas procedure applies even when the faa applies substantively see jd edwards world solutions co v estes inc  swd   texappfort worth  pet denied we need not determine whether confirmation of an awardparticularly at what time a party must file a motion to vacate to modify or to correct an award after a motion to confirm the award has been filedis procedural or substantive or which act applies because our conclusion would be the same under either act  the warren court reasoned section  directs that the court shall grant the order confirming the award unless the award is vacated modified or corrected provided in sections  and  in context including the specific requirement of written notice to the adverse party this section apparently contemplates that any motions to vacate modify or correct will be before the court when it rules on the motion to confirm this construction is further confirmed by the provision directing entry of a conforming judgment or decree upon granting of an order confirming modifying correcting or vacating an award §  since that direction apparently contemplates that the court would consider such motions together rather than in succession otherwise the procedures hearings and action of the court in the motion to confirm could be held for naught and the whole process repeated we do not readily infer a legislative intent to squander scarce judicial time in this manner although there is no express provision to this effect we hold that the fair intendment of the arbitration act bars the filing of motions under sections  and  once the court has entered a judgment confirming the award under section  this construction facilitates the limited scope of review and the considerations of finality sought to be served by our policies on judicial review of arbitration awards robinson  wells pc v warren  pd   utah  citations and footnotes omitted emphasis added the hamm parties argue that we may not consider the warren courts holding because in that case the appellant moved to vacate the award not only after judgment but outside the threemonth statutory period for filing such motions see id at  although the warren court itself noted this fact that was not the primary basis for its disposition rather the court identified this as an additional basis to deny appellate relief id at  n  that additional basis however was separate from and did not convert into dictum the primary basis for the courts holding that a motion to vacate could not under the statutes plain language be brought after judgment confirming the award had been rendered id at  discussing the two bases separately the filedoutsidestatutorytimelimit basis being noted only in footnote as alternative ground for disposition  see  uscs §  three months tex civ prac  remcode ann §§ b b  days  by postsubmission letter briefing the hamm parties offer three reasons that we not follow the hartbridge courts cited holding first they argue that this was not a true holding however the hartbridge court understood this discussion as necessary to its ultimate disposition see id  fd at  the order of confirmation was correct unless the court abused its discretion in not postponing action on the motion to confirm if confirmation did not preclude the appellant from thereafter moving to vacate the award there was obviously no prejudicial abuse of discretion in entering the order of confirmation the district court thought such a motion could still be made with this we cannot agree emphasis added moreover the second circuit court of appeals has described its conclusion in the hartbridge as a holding see florasynth inc v pickholz  fd   nd cir on appeal in the hartbridge we  held that one partys motion to confirm an arbitration award imposes on the other party an obligation to move to vacate if he intends to do so emphasis added second the hamm parties argue that the hartbridge holding on which we rely has been mostly ignored or rejected however this court has favorably cited related aspects of the hartbridge the second circuit court of appeals in florasynth itself has since noted the hartbridges holding and did not contrary to the hamm parties assertion reject any holdings of that case and even courts that have held contrary to the hartbridge have failed to mention that opinion from our research it simply appears that the timing issue itself has rarely surfaced as demonstrated by the extremely limited authority on the matter which authority is fairly evenly split rather than that courts have universally rejected the hartbridges conclusion third the hamm parties argue that the authority on which the hartbridge court relied did not support its conclusion we disagree that this authority did not support the hartbridge courts holding see gaines v clark  minn    if they had any reason to urge why the award should not stand they had an opportunity to present it and it was their duty to present it when the application to confirm and for judgment was made and as they failed to do so without any excuse for such failure they ought not to be heard after the judgment brace v stacy  wis    nw   wis we are clearly of the opinion that the arbitration statute contemplates that all motions to vacate or modify the award must be made before the same is confirmed and judgment entered thereon in any event we believe that the holding of the hartbridge is required in texas as explained elsewhere in our opinion both by statutory language and common sense  we note however that the same division of this court has at least once indicated that it might reach a contrary conclusion see clearwater v skyline constr co  wash app    pd   washapp  rev denied regarding statutory threemonth period in which to move to vacate arbitration award stating this could be read to mean that  months is the maximum period in which a motion to vacate may be filed not that the month period is available in every situation generally when a motion to confirm an arbitration award is filed within the month period the motion to vacate should also be brought at that time so that the two motions can be heard together citations omitted emphasis in original  see cvn group inc v delgado

the interest of justice we granted the hamm parties opposed postsubmission motion to amend their opening brief to assert a challenge to the denial of their continuance motion see texrapp p   by postsubmission letter briefing the hamm parties assert that the mere filing of their motion for continuance sufficed to preserve their right to file a motion to vacate or to modify the award after the trial court confirmed the award the hamm parties position would in effect avoid a determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying their continuance motion if all that one needs to do before judgment is merely to advise the trial court by moving for more time to do so that it will file a motion to vacate after judgment then it is irrelevant whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the continuance motion and one may still move to vacate the award postjudgment this is not the law in texas see thomas james assocs inc v owens  swd   texappdallas  no pet holding that abuseofdiscretion standard applies in reviewing continuance motion made in conjunction with motions to confirm and to vacate arbitration award the hamm parties reliance on the hartbridge for their position is unavailing because in that case as the court itself noted the record revealed that the trial court had incorrectly assumed that it had no discretion to grant a continuance see id  fd at  because the district court had declined to exercise any discretion on the motion to continue the confirmation hearing the appellate court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new hearing see id that is not the case here moreover  and unlike here  the appellant in the hartbridge must have assigned error on appeal to the denial of its continuance motion because the court considered that issue on the merits see id the hamm parties also rely on paley associates inc v universal woolens inc in support of their position  f supp   sdny the paley court interpreted a preconfirmation continuance motion as an objection to the confirmation of the arbitration award and concluded that the movant had thereby preserved its right to move later to vacate the confirmation id in texas however the appellate court looks to whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a continuance motion for the reasons stated in that motion see owens  swd at   rule  applied

vernon  not providing for procedure for motions to continue consideration of motions to confirm to vacate to modify or to correct arbitration awards  the motion cited only generally the taas provisions concerning vacating and modifying or correcting arbitration awards arguing simply that there are substantial factual and legal errors in the award without further specificity  in fact we note that the hamm parties motion to vacate urged in the main that the arbitrators had exceeded their authority under the arbitration agreements by interpreting the partnership agreements incorrectly and by committing errors of law in doing so these grounds did not necessarily require the entire arbitration record which was the reason that the hamm parties had earlier sought a continuance  compare

late s the hamm parties and millennium formed seven limited partnerships to build and to operate marriott hotels hamm later assigned a percentage of his interest to brinsden and brinsden became a limited partner in four of the hotels brinsdens name did not appear in the partnership agreements dissolution provisions however the partnership agreements contained identical arbitration provisions the arbitration provisions were broadly worded to encompass any claim action dispute or controversy of any kind that arises out of or relates to this agreement or concerns any aspect of performance by any partner under the terms of this agreement    in march  millennium sued the hamm parties the instant lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order and temporary injunctive relief to prevent the

mitchell would wind up the partnerships and distribute the assets to the partners in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreements the parties did not agree on a new general partner and mitchell whom the trial court appointed as receiver began the process of winding up the partnerships and distributing the assets by arranging for the sale of  the hotels after mitchell had paid the mortgage loans for the hotels approximately  million remained for distribution to the partners on march   brinsden intervened in the lawsuit brinsden claimed that because of a mutual mistake his name had been inadvertently omitted from the dissolution section of the partnership agreements in his motion for leave to intervene he stated that his claims have neither been addressed by the arbitrator or the receiver or were never in issue until one month ago and he is compelled to intervene in the case at bar so that an arbitrator may reform the partnership agreements to confirm the intent of the parties and conduct an evidentiary hearing to calculate the worth of brinsdens five percent ownership interest    mitchell then filed a first and amended receivers motion for distribution and receivers report on distribution of partnership assets the receivers report in the receivers report and his accompanying motion to distribute mitchell stated that there were many disputes among the parties regarding the terms of section  of the partnership agreements and the distributions to be made upon the partnerships dissolution and that there is no agreement among the parties about how the assets of the partnerships should be distributed mitchell also stated that brinsdens ownership interest has not been determined in this litigation likewise mitchell noted that hamm corp is left out of the distribution of capital proceeds under § b of the partnership agreements dissolution provisions instead of trying to resolve the disputes and ambiguities mitchell provided four alternative distribution schedules to the trial court millennium and brinsden objected to the receivers report on various grounds on may   the hamm parties served an arbitration demand on appellees and filed the demand with the aaa seeking to resolve the disputes about the distribution of assets under section  of the partnership agreements on may  the hamm parties filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay litigation in the instant lawsuit seeking to stay the litigation pending arbitration to stay ruling on the receivers motion to distribute and to compel arbitration on the disputed issues relating to section  of the partnership agreements they sought to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa and only in the event that the trial court found the faa not to apply under the texas general arbitration act taa  millennium responded to the hamm parties motion to compel and filed a motion to stay hamms collateral attacks on this courts judgment in its motion to stay millennium sought to stay both the arbitration instigated before the aaa and the second lawsuit with regard to the hamm parties request for arbitration millennium argued that the arbitrator had already considered and determined everything on which the hamm parties sought a second arbitration so that res judicata barred a second arbitration the hamm parties responded raising among other arguments that whether res judicata barred a second arbitration was a preliminary matter for the arbitrator to decide within the context of the second arbitration and was not a matter for the trial courts consideration the hamm parties also asserted in the alternative arguments on the merits of millenniums res judicata defense on may   the trial court considered the hamm parties motion to compel arbitration millenniums motion to stay proceedings and the receivers motion to order distribution the hamm parties objected to the trial courts consideration of millenniums motion to stay because all matters raised were for the arbitrator to decide not the court and they objected to the trial courts consideration of the receivers motion to distribute until after arbitration had been conducted the trial court overruled these objections after the hearing the trial court granted millenniums motion to stay by the order of which the hamm parties complain staying both the second lawsuit and the aaa arbitration proceedings the trial court did not expressly rule on the hamm parties motion to compel arbitration by separate order the trial court approved the receivers report selected the first method of mitchells four alternative distribution schedules and ordered distribution of all liquidation proceeds except for  which was reserved for any future expenses that the receiver might incur the hamm parties perfected this interlocutory appeal and filed a petition for writ of mandamus complaining of the trial courts may  order staying arbitration proceedings millennium has moved to dismiss the interlocutory appeal on the basis that only mandamus review is available and this motion remains pending before the court pending resolution of the appellate proceedings the hamm parties moved for an emergency stay of the separate may  order of distribution this court denied the hamm parties motion on may   mitchell distributed all of the liquidation proceeds except the  that he had been ordered to reserve mitchell paid the internal revenue service for taxes that the hamm parties owed satisfied the arbitrators monetary judgments against the hamm parties and gave the hamm parties a cashiers check for their portion of the distribution which they accepted based on these distributions millennium argues in its briefing in the mandamus proceeding that the mandamus proceeding is moot because the proceeds have already been distributed the hamm parties respond in part that mootness is a matter for the arbitrator to decide  rather than for any court to adjudicate is interlocutory appeal or mandamus the proper method of review on appeal no party disputes that the faa applies to the arbitration agreement the arbitration agreement provides that the faa will apply to their disputes see alliedbruce terminix co v dobson  us    s ct    l ed d   parties may validly agree to arbitrate under the faa see in re kellogg brown  root  swd   texapphouston st dist  orig proceeding concluding that faa applied because parties had agreed to arbitrate under faa additionally appellant and appellees expressly agreed in the arbitration agreement that the transaction involved interstate commerce see jack b anglin co inc v tipps  swd    tex  stating that faa applies when contract relates to interstate commerce see also  usca §  even when the faa applies to an arbitration agreement however the parties may invoke the taa to enforce the agreement as long as nothing in the taa would thwart the faas policies or goals in the particular context in re d wilson constr co  swd   tex we conclude that mandamus is the only means for reviewing the complainedof order the order of which the hamm parties complain is an interlocutory one granting a stay of arbitration proceedings on the basis of res judicata that is not an interlocutory order for which the taa or other texas statute gives the right of interlocutory appeal see tex civ prac  remcode ann § a vernon   supp not listing this type of order as one for which interlocutory appeal is available id § a vernon  granting right of interlocutory appeal of order granting an application to stay arbitration made under section  emphasis added see also id §  vernon  allowing for application to stay arbitration on basis that no agreement to arbitrate exists nor can the granting of this order necessarily be considered the denial of the hamm parties motion to compel arbitration the taa makes an order denying an application to compel arbitration an appealable order see id § a by granting millenniums motion to stay the arbitration filed with the aaa on the basis of res judicata the court no longer needed to rule on the hamm parties motion to compel arbitration that is the granting of millenniums motion could have simply mooted the hamm parties motion rather than necessarily having denied it implicitly cf stolhandske v stern  swd   texapphouston st dist  pet denied holding that no appeal lay over trial courts interlocutory order vacating arbitrators award and ordering new arbitration even though opposing party had filed motion to confirm arbitration award because the vacating of an arbitration award does not automatically deny a motion to confirm but renders the consideration of an application to confirm moot we are strictly to construe the legislative bases for allowing interlocutory appeals given that interlocutory appeals are in derogation of the general rule that only final judgments are appealable see eg bison bldg materials ltd v aldridge no cv  swd   wl  at  texapphouston st dist sept   pet filed concluding same in context of interlocutory appeal of order confirming in part and vacating in part arbitration award considering this general rule and because we cannot necessarily construe an express granting of millenniums motion to stay as an implicit denial of the hamm parties  motion to compel we hold that no interlocutory appeal lies from the order staying arbitration proceedings we sustain millenniums motion to dismiss the hamm parties interlocutory appeal because no statute authorizes appeal from this type of interlocutory order mandamus is thus the only appropriate vehicle for challenging this order we determine below whether the hamm parties have shown their right to mandamus relief who decides the issues the trial court or the arbitrator under part of issue two the hamm parties argue that the trial court erred by granting millenniums motion to stay the second arbitration because the ground that that motion asserted  as well as various grounds asserted on appeal based on the postorder distribution  were matters for the arbitrator rather than for the trial court to decide a what the standard of review and burden are mandamus is an extraordinary remedy which will issue only to correct a clear abuse of discretion or a violation of a duty imposed by law when there is no adequate remedy by appeal in re ford motor co  swd   tex citing in re prudential ins co  swd   tex walker v packer  swd   tex a trial court abuses its discretion when it errs in determining what the law is or in applying the law to the facts in re

movant fall within the arbitration agreements scope in re kepka  swd   texapphouston st dist  orig proceeding here however no one has ever disputed the existence of an agreement to arbitrate indeed the hamm parties and millennium have already arbitrated under the same arbitration agreements and brinsdens motion for leave to intervene invoked the arbitration agreements neither does anyone dispute that the matters that the hamm parties sought to send to arbitration  concerning the meaning of section  and its effect on the distribution of the partnerships assets  fell within the scope of the arbitration agreements see id at  when as here the arbitration agreement uses broad language such as arising out of or in any way related or connected to to define the scope of arbitrability the moving party must show that the factual allegations against it touch matters covered by the underlying agreement quoting houscape inc v lloyd  swd   texapphouston st dist  orig proceeding b whether the trial court abused its discretion rather than disputing the arbitration agreements existence or arguing whether the contractual matters that the hamm parties sought to arbitrate fell within the arbitration provisions scope the parties joined the following four issues below   whether millenniums defense of res judicata was a matter for the court or the arbitrator to determine  assuming that the court was the proper entity to determine the res judicata defense whether that defense was meritorious  whether the issue of estoppel based on hamms admissions in the  arbitration was a matter for the court or the arbitrator to determine  assuming that the court is the proper entity to determine this estoppel defense whether the hamm parties were estopped from denying brinsdens interests in the partnerships based on admissions that hamm had made in the  arbitration to these four issues the parties have added four more that are based on the receivers distribution of partnership assets during pendency of the appellate proceedings  whether the issue of mootness based on distribution of proceeds is a matter for the court or the arbitrator to determine  assuming that the court is the proper entity to determine mootness whether the hamm parties request for arbitration and its appellate challenges are mooted by the distribution  whether the issue of estoppel based on the hamm parties alleged acceptance of the distribution proceeds was a matter for the court or the arbitrator to determine  assuming that the court is the proper entity to determine this estoppel defense whether the hamm parties are estopped from contesting the distribution because they accepted its benefits  res judicata and arbitrability in part of issue two the hamm parties argue that whether res judicata bars a second arbitration is a matter for the arbitrator rather than for the trial court millennium responds that because the trial court confirmed the arbitration award which thereby became its judgment the trial court rather than the arbitrator properly granted the stay to protect its own judgment from attack in howsam v dean witter reynolds inc the united states supreme court established the paradigm for determining what matters were to be decided by the arbitrator and what were to be decided by the court  us    s ct    l ed d   the howsam court concluded that unless an arbitration agreement provides otherwise a court may determine only matters of substantive arbitrability ie whether a particular dispute falls within the scope of an arbitration provision as well as the threshold question of whether that provision  is enforceable id at   sct at  in contrast the court also determined that the arbitrator rather than the court should determine matters of procedural arbitrability ie those matters that grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition id quoting john wiley  sons inc v livingston  us    s ct    l ed d   the howsam court offered as examples of matters of procedural arbitrability waiver delay time limits notice laches estoppel conditions precedent and like defenses id at   sct at  quoting moses h cone meml hosp v mercury constr corp  us    s ct    l ed d   and revised uniform arbitration act § c  cmt   ula  the howsam court reasoned that the parties would likely expect that an arbitrator would decide such gateway proceduralarbitrability matters because these matters grow out of and bear on the final disposition of the parties dispute id at   sct at  that is under the faa although courts are empowered to determine whether the dispute should be resolved in court or in arbitration arbitrators are empowered absent an agreement to the contrary to resolve disputes over whether a particular claim may be successfully litigated anywhere at all    or has any substantive merits whatsoever klay v united healthgroup inc  fd   th cir res judicata can apply to bar rearbitration of matters that have already been arbitrated see jarrod wong court or arbitrator  who decides whether res judicata bars subsequent arbitration under the federal arbitration act  santa clara lrev    hereinafter wong the question remains however whether the court or the arbitrator has the authority under the faa to determine whether a later arbitration is barred by a prior one the howsam court set out the test to apply but it did not consider how that test applied to the defense of res judicata although there is no texas state authority on this issue federal court decisions decided under the faa resolve the dispute the majority of federal courts has determined that whether a prior arbitration proceeding is res judicata of a later one is a matter for the arbitrator to determine absent the arbitration agreements providing that the defense of res judicata is not subject to arbitration that is  under this authority the res judicata effect of a prior arbitration award is a matter of procedural arbitrability that is not the courts province to decide the reasoning of these courts is as follows res judicata is an affirmative defense on the merits see williams v houston firemens relief  ret fund  swd   n  texapphouston st dist  no pet accordingly it is a matter that grows out of the dispute and bears on its final disposition which under the howsam courts paradigm is one of procedural arbitrability howsam  us at   sct at  that is res judicata is a component of the dispute on the merits and must be considered by the arbitrator not the courts chiron corp v ortho diagnostic sys inc  fd   th cir accord natl union fire ins co v belco petroleum corp  fd   nd cir some of these courts have expressly rejected the argument that requiring an arbitrator to determine the res judicata effect of a prior arbitral award will allow prior arbitral decisions to be relitigated ad infinitum they reason that the parties have the same ability to pursue a res judicata defense before the second arbitrator as they would have before a court see local  of intl union of electrical radio  machine workers aflcio v rca corp  fd   rd cir accord little six corp v united mine workers of am local union no   fd   th

further arbitration there is a limited exception to the above rule that res judicata is for the arbitrator see wong at  john hancock mut life ins co v olick  fd   rd cir using term exception to describe this situation when the prior judgment that could have preclusive effect arose from a court proceeding  that is when the first adjudication was in court rather than by arbitration  the court may determine whether res judicata bars a subsequent arbitration we refer to this as the priorcourtjudgment exception the rationale for the priorcourtjudgment exception is that a court is inherently empowered to protect the integrity and finality of its own prior judgment and this policy outweighs even the strong policy in favor of arbitration olick  fd at   millennium relies on the priorcourtjudgment exception despite the fact that the first adjudication was by arbitration not by the court millennium implicitly reasons that because the trial court confirmed the  arbitration award that award had the effect of a judgment of the court which the court could protect by injunction see  usc §   providing that judgment confirming arbitration award has same force and effect as court judgment tex civ prac  rem code ann § a vernon  providing that order confirming arbitration award under taa may be enforced in the same manner as any other judgment or decree at least one federal court has expressly rejected the argument that millennium makes see chiron corp  fd at  and other federal courts have applied the general proceduralarbitrability rule to a res judicata defense despite the prior arbitral awards having been confirmed see belco petroleum corp  fd at  nd cir not discussing priorcourtjudgment exception but applying general proceduralarbitrability rule despite prior awards confirmation basin elec pow coop v ppl energy plus llc  f supp d   dnd same simply put the priorcourtjudgment exception raises institutional concerns that are not present when the prior adjudication occurred at arbitration see olick  fd at  this is true even when the prior arbitration award has been confirmed by court judgment as the chiron court explained relying on the language of  usc section  ortho argues that we must treat the district courts confirmation of the arbitration award as if it were a judgment rendered in a judicial proceeding this approach however begs the question because the statute says nothing about which forum or who determines the effect of the judgment moreover it obscures the fact that while a judgment entered upon a confirmed arbitration award has the same force and effect under the faa as a court judgment for enforcement purposes it is not wholly parallel to a court judgment for all purposes indeed there are fundamental differences between confirmed arbitration awards and judgments arising from a judicial proceeding absent an objection on one of the narrow grounds set forth in the faa the faa requires the court to enter judgment upon a confirmed arbitration award without reviewing either the merits of the award or the legal basis upon which it was reached a judgment upon a decision or order rendered by the court at the conclusion of a judicial proceeding by contrast confirms the merits of that decision    in sum a judgment upon a confirmed arbitration award is qualitatively different from a judgment in a court proceeding even though the judgment is recognized under the faa for enforcement purposes chiron corp  fd at  emphasis in original footnote omitted moreover if the judicial confirmation of an arbitration award were all that it took to bootstrap a prior arbitration award into the priorcourtjudgment exception the limited exception would swallow the general rule accordingly we hold that the trial court clearly abused its discretion to the extent that it based its stay on  a determination that res judicata barred arbitration on  the hamm parties request or on  a determination that a stay was necessary to protect the integrity of the trial courts order confirming the  arbitration award we sustain this portion of issue two  mootness and arbitrability in its briefing in the mandamus proceeding millennium argues that the proceeds distribution pursuant to the separate distribution order moots the underlying matters that the hamm parties seek to send to arbitration and thus the mandamus proceeding under part of issue two the hamm parties argue that whether the proceeds distribution moots a second arbitration is itself a matter for the arbitrator rather than for the trial court although there is no texas authority on this issue federal authority does exist and it consistently holds that whether matters sought to be arbitrated are in fact moot is a question of procedural arbitrability that is reserved for the arbitrator absent the parties agreement to the contrary because the issue of whether subsequent events have rendered the hamm parties arbitration filing moot is for the arbitrator that matter is not for any court to determine because a court may not determine whether the pending arbitration is moot we may not hold that this mandamus proceeding is moot put another way because the order staying arbitration prevented the matter of section s interpretation from going to arbitration and because the arbitrator alone may determine whether the matter submitted for arbitration is moot there is still a live controversy before this court we sustain this portion of issue two  estoppel and arbitrability under part of issue two the hamm parties also argue that millenniums and brinsdens separate estoppel defenses set out above are matters for the arbitrator rather than for the trial court the united states supreme court has already indicated that questions of estoppel are matters of procedural arbitrability under the faa that are for the arbitrator rather than for the court see howsam  us at   sct at  quoting moses h cone meml hosp  us at   sct at  and revised uniform arbitration act § c  cmt   ula  accord boateng v gen dynamics corp  f supp d   dmass in re global constr co  swd   texapphouston th dist  orig proceeding citing in dictum howsams mention of estoppels being matter of procedural arbitrability we follow howsam and hold that the trial court clearly abused its discretion if it based its stay on a determination of the  estoppel grounds argued by millennium and brinsden we sustain this portion of issue two c whether the remedy by appeal is adequate the order staying the arbitration that the hamm parties instigated with the aaa was clearly erroneous for the reasons stated above we further hold that no adequate remedy by appeal exists for the order first the order is interlocutory because the receivership has not been wound up and for the reasons stated above the order is not appealable under the taa or other statute second no one disputes that the partnership agreements arbitration provisions encompass in the abstract the subject matter that the hamm parties seek to arbitrate a dispute concerning the meaning of the distribution provisions of the partnership agreements third the hamm parties have no means of arbitrating that dispute in the face of a stay of the arbitration that they instigated to determine that dispute accordingly we hold that no adequate remedy by appeal exists from the portion of the trial courts may   order that stayed the arbitration initiated by the hamm parties as result of their may   arbitration demand conclusion we dismiss the interlocutory appeal in cause number cv we conditionally grant mandamus relief in cause number cv the trial court is ordered to vacate that portion of its may   order that stays any arbitration proceedings based on the hamm parties may   demand we are confident that the trial court will comply with our determination writ will issue only if the court fails to so comply notes  brinsden was not a party to that arbitration  section  governed the distribution of the partnership assets upon dissolution  in its objection millennium argued that the receivers report had erroneously calculated and interpreted the partnership agreements priority return provision in his objection brinsden disagreed with mitchells delineation of the evidence of his entitlement to capital distribution and mitchells conclusion that brinsden was a limited partner without any interest in the distribution of the capital proceeds  on april   the hamm parties also filed a new lawsuit in the th district court of harris county texas trial court cause number xxxxxxxxx seeking a declaratory judgment to resolve the same issues the second lawsuit the record implies that the second lawsuit was eventually transferred to the trial court that rendered the complainedof order in the instant lawsuit although no such transfer order appears in the record  see  usca §§  west   supp   see tex civ prac  remcode ann §§  vernon   the hamm parties do not complain of the portion of the order staying the second lawsuit rather they complain before this court only of the portion of the order that stayed the aaa arbitration proceedings therefore the propriety of the trial courts having stayed the second lawsuit is not before us see tex civ prac  remcode ann § a vernon   supp not listing interlocutory order staying another lawsuit as one for which interlocutory appeal is granted id §  vernon  same  for this reason we overrule the hamm parties issue one in which they argue that the trial court abused its discretion by denying a motion to compel arbitration of disputes that were subject to an arbitration agreement the hamm parties motion to compel arbitration remains pending before the trial court  on appeal millennium asserts that the hamm parties waived the right to enforce arbitration by their substantial invocation of the judicial process to millenniums detriment millennium then argues that whether the hamm parties thereby waived the right to arbitrate was a matter for the court to determine rather than for the arbitrator however millennium did not assert this type of waiver as a ground in its motion to stay and the matter does not appear to have been litigated by anyone below for example no one expressly argued below as to how the hamm parties invocation of the judicial process was substantial for purposes of this type of waiver and no one offered evidence as to how that invocation had been detrimental to millennium accordingly such waiver will not form the basis for this courts disposition see bates v mth homestex lp  swd   texapphouston st dist  no pet

arbitration that motion remains pending before the trial court
