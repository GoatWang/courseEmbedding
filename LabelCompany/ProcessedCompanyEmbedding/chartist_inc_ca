me forgot password   the strategy of the chartist newsletter has evolved over the years but its basic approach to the market remains the same founder and editor dan sullivan explains we do not make predictions or pretend to have a crystal ball instead we let the market be our guide if we are wrong we simply get out of the market and wait for a more opportune time and while we are quick to sell off our losers we part with our winners very slowly this approach might not work for everyone but it has certainly worked for us the chartist is unusual because of the thousands of investment advisory newsletters published in the us only a few follow their own advice with real money on the line sullivan is highly critical of the socalled hypothetical portfolios contending that they are out of touch with the real world dan sullivans investment strategy is dictated by an ironclad discipline profits are allowed to run losses are quickly cut and he uses relative strength for his stock selection process essentially this is a buy high sell higher approach the basic concept of relative strength is that the stocks that are stronger compared to their peers will appreciate to a much greater degree than the average issue this dictates buying stocks after they have already made significant gains the average investor finds this difficult to do because it is in effect the opposite of conventional lore of buying low and selling high the high relative strength stocks however are exactly the ones sullivan wants because they offer the potential for the greatest gains it should be cautioned that relative strength is a doubleedged sword these stocks have the potential for outsized gains in bull markets but will be among the hardest hit during bear markets for this reason sullivan combines his stock selection process with market timing his proprietary indicators measure the risk in the stock market this strategy allows sullivan to invest in topperforming stocks while keeping the overall risk low sullivan has been successfully utilizing these techniques for over  years he believes in his disciplined approach to investing and puts real money on the line to prove it the chartist is one of the very few advisory services that actually buys and sells the stocks it recommends in an industry where hundreds of financial newsletters come and go every year the chartist has stood the test of
