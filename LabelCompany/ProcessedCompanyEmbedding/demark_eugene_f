digital economy magazine article the cpa journal revenue recognition issues in a digital economy by demark eugene f read preview magazine article the cpa journal revenue recognition issues in a digital economy by demark eugene f read preview article excerpt many traditional business models have been modified or discarded in the face of technological advances new business models also raise significant accounting questions concerning revenue recognition or determining the proper time to book a sale and its related expenses many cases are simple revenue is recognized when the goods are delivered or the services are performed but the issue often gets more complicated particularly in the hightech sector because of a practice called bundling which occurs when a company packages a principal product eg a cellphone or satellite dish with ancillary products or ongoing services eg providing the wireless service or maintaining a signal to the dish receiver bundling not only augments revenues but also extends the contract between the company and its customers beyond the traditional point of sale this leads to an accounting issue if a business bundles multiple revenuegenerating activities into a single transaction when is it appropriate to account for the entire arrangement as a single transaction and recognize the revenue in the period of the initial sale and when is it

of each arrangement must be analyzed to determine if these ancillary services constitute separate elements that may call for separate accounting this subject is being considered by fasbs emerging issues task force eitf in the absence of a fasb pronouncement the sec has indicated that it would not object to an accounting treatment for multipleelement arrangements that includes the following conditions  to be considered a separate element the deliverable must represent a separate earnings process … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and over
