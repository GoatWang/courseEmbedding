it is a little bit tempting since i do not know if i am going to be in a unit or if shell plans on drilling any time soon and i am looking to retire  i have  acres in londonderry township in guernsey

retire and found out being with the wife  isnt as easy as the work was ya normally see these guys at walmart saying welcome to walmart selling mineral rights is a one time deal with no turning back with a lease you might if worded right get a decent bonus and possibly renewal payment or another lease plus royalty  you might consider selling the property outright with mineral rights included which opens the door to speculators also ▶ reply permalink reply by kathleen on may   at pm i personally would wait at least a year and see what shell does  is good money but you could do better if i was to sell them i would contact an auction house and see if they are interested i really think  thousand for  acres of minerals seems low recently someone sold theirs already leased for more at auction the link was on this site but i dont remember where right now if i remember right it was  acres and they got  per acre that would be  more minus the auction fee if the drilling picks up and the numbers are good in your area these numbers could even go higher and you wouldnt have the tax burden of the royalties everyone has their own personal thought on this topic with some people saying never sell i think if someone really thinks about it looks at it in all directions and still wants to sell than they should sell ▶ reply permalink reply by susan a tippel on may   at am i have decided

continue recording oil and natural gas leases for marcellus and utica shale drilling some companies are now purchasing minerals instead of merely leasing them wheeling wva — it appears as if a slight shift is taking place in the local gas leasing rush as at least one firm is now purchasing entire mineral tracts from upper ohio valley property owners instead of entering into lease agreements the amounts offered for buying minerals can vary widely belmont county recorder’s office data indicate oklahoma citybased westhawk minerals llc paid about  per acre for one particular acre tract near shadyside in november while the firm tendered a little more than  per acre for another tract near fairpoint in august in west virginia westhawk paid about  per acre for land in the bethlehem area the ohio county clerk’s office shows the firm paid amounts ranging from  per acre in marshall county records indicate the practice can be beneficial for property owners in that the upfront payment likely will be higher than what is offered through a lease agreement but royalties are not included and for tracts with true drilling potential this could mean the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars over the life of a lease tim greene owner of land and mineral management of appalachia and a former west virginia department of environmental protection inspector said purchasing minerals instead of just leasing them is fairly common “lots of companies just buy them and flip them onto someone else” he said of the practice of the purchasing firm selling the minerals to another company “but if they buy all the minerals that is it you won’t get any royalties or anything else “if getting  right now could change my life selling out might be something i am interested in” greene added charlie burd executive director of the independent oil and gas association of west virginia said some firms purchasing oil and natural gas minerals may already have agreements to transfer those properties to established drilling firms sometimes companies do this so they can acquire the land at a lower price than they would have to pay if property owners knew the identity of the ultimate owner “it’s not atypical for one company to purchase minerals in hopes of selling them to a major company” burd said “they may already have a contract with a major company but there could be a nondisclosure agreement in place” burd said mineral owner groups often form to negotiate better terms with a company he said companies assembling blocks of acreage to sell to a driller is a similar scenario the sunday newsregister reported on such a situation in  during the early stages of the region’s drilling boom when a company known as ed broome inc of glenville wva sold  acres of oil and gas rights in wetzel county to chesapeake energy for  million broome had speculated on the mineral rights over a period of years and when the drilling boom began he quickly agreed to the deal with chesapeake greene said a mineral owner may actually receive more money in a lump sum than they otherwise would citing the fact that a driller may decide to never produce gas from one’s property “it’s all about how badly you need the money and how long you are willing to wait to get that money” he said “by leasing you are likely to make more money over time but you may not have that time” messages left with westhawk officials were not immediately returned according to the firm’s website it has more than  years experience in purchasing oil and natural gas assets “in the long term we feel the oil and natural gas prices will generally trend upward and we believe buying oil and gas rights now is a good investment” the website states to read more from the intelligencerwheeling newsregister subscribe here  posted
