the  investor problem  feld thoughts press enter to search archive marathons books about legal back to top january   the  investor problem when the jobs act was finalized one of the rule changes that had a lot of fanfare around it was the increase in the number of shareholders a private company could have prior to the jobs act it was  after which point the company had to register and report to the sec just like it was a public company even if it hadn’t gone public this was a major issue for many fast growing companies that either went through strange contortions not to have  investors or filed with the sec to get noaction letters there were plenty of nuances around this rule and i was in the middle of several situations that structured around it legally each time it was a lot of overhead for the company in question none of which added anything to the system except fees to the lawyers lifting the number of investors to  seemed to make sense in the situations i was involved in it would have immediately solved the specific problem so that’s good but ever since we started working with angellist on fg angels we’ve been wrestling with something called we’ve been referring to as the  investor problem we structure our investment in companies via an llc that has all the individual fg angels syndicate members in it this simplifies life for the company as they only end up with  investor – the fg angels syndicate lcc – rather than a bunch of individual investors at this point we have  backers in our syndicate so with us each company would end up having  separate investors if we didn’t use the llc if everyone was on the cap table the company would have to chase down  signatures for everything instead using our approach they have effectively two investors – our fg angels syndicate one investor and foundry group another investor two signatures much easier we handle the foundry group signature angellist handles the syndicate signature except it doesn’t work that way the sec limits an llc to having  investors so we can only have  of the  syndicate members participate now there’s a nuance that excludes “qualified purchasers” qps – individuals with m in assets and firms with m in assets – from the  investor count overall our qps  the top  investors in our syndicate represent  based on committed amounts to fg angels if you include the balance of the  members we end up at a syndicate of  the company then gets our commitment of  on top of that as a result of this  investor limitation we have two disappointing problems first we have over  investors who would like to invest in our syndicate with us who get excluded because of the  investor rule next there is  per investment that we’d like to include in each syndicate that the companies we are investing in won’t get bad for the companies and bad for the investor we’ve spent lots of time over the past  days trying to solve the  investor problem at this point we’ve run into a dead end we’ve tried multiple llcs – that doesn’t work as they end up getting viewed as a single entity we’ve tried other structures – that doesn’t work we’re certainly open to ideas at this point in the mean time until we solve this angellist is making the following changes to their syndicates product – qualified purchasers angellist will include all qualified purchasers individuals with m in assets and firms with m in assets in each syndicated deal as they are exempt from the sec’s investor limit we will soon email your backers to determine if they are qualified purchasers qps and we will update your syndicate management interface to indicate the qps – top  backers the next time you syndicate a deal we will include all qps and the top  nonqps by commitment amount you can override this default to include specific backers who are not in the top  the top  backers will change dynamically as backers adjust their backing amounts – funds we are working on new funds products to allow additional investors who are not in your top  backers or qps to participate in your syndicated deals – notifying backers finally we will notify your backers of the sec’s investor restriction this week and give them the opportunity to change their backing amounts we are bummed about this because part of our goal is to build a very large angel network as a result of the fg angels activity the  investor rule directly undermines this and limits the amount of investment and support for the companies we are investing in it’s another example of the challenges of the jobs act and another discovery on our part of the “miss” between the goal of the new law and the implementation sean killeen disclaimer i know next to nothing about these aspects of business and am purely spitballing so apologies if this is unworkable a thought instead of splitting up the investors into groups could you split up what they’re investing in into groups if you have  investors could you create three entities for them to invest in that are all controlled by the syndicate which would allow  per trying to turn the problem on its head to see if it makes more sense to shuffle things around on the flip side jasonmendelson the sec is too smart for that and will consider them as one entity sigh… david brooks very interesting i would assume this will lead to a small number of very large syndicates hopefully angellist creates enough transparency among smaller investors so that they know where they stack up in a syndicate and have flexibility to move to others with less backing but will investors do that or is the idea of a superstar lead too compelling jasonmendelson trying to post again… i agree with your take large syndicates will need to have higher investing followers no idea what investors will do but it’s a serious bummer that we can’t truly have crowdfunding here jlm  potential solution investors form gp or lp with unlimited number of investors and with conditions determined by investors en masse this effectively mirrors the angellist syndicate rules you are effectively moving the angellist rules upstream gp or lp forms llc with a single managing member and the gp or lp as other member llc — with single managing member and gp or lp member — joins angellist as investment vehicle new llc makes investments and complies with all secjobs act and angellist rules variation on theme each investment uses a mirror image but “one off” llc in order not to commingle different investments this would also be a bit of legal insurance against spill over legal liability jlm  millie tadewaldt good ideas the issue here is that the sec is too smart for that 🙂 and it “looks through” all investment vehicles that are formed specifically for the purpose of buying the same portfolio company counting all of the individual investors in those special purpose vehicles against the investor limit it is possible for form a more “fundlike” investment vehicle that deploys capital across multiple deals without triggering the lookthrough davej have you looked into setting it up as a mutual fund jasonmendelson we haven’t because as mutual fund managers we’d be liable to all of the syndicate members if we chose bad investors our investors in the our main venture funds would not allow this and we are generally scared of lawyers which is why i stopped looking in mirrors long ago joe wallin davej–cost of being a mutual fund is prohibitive so it is not a practical solution brett topche it’s an issue for small traditional funds as well depending on which sec exemption you use to raise your fund you are typically limited to  lps not an issue for larger funds with fewer larger institutional commitments but for smaller funds raised primarily from high net worth individuals it can be a pain in the ass also from the company standpoint if the llc is formed solely for the purpose of investing in that company ie your syndicate forms a new llc for each investment which seems likely given that the syndicate changes over time all of the investors in the llc count towards their  limit not necessarily a huge deal for one syndicate investing in a company but if you have a couple of syndicates involved even though you only have to chase down one signature you can start eating into your  jasonmendelson agreed tubbybartles this issue is more difficult than other angellist issues elsewhere angellist is meeting the spirit of the law but needed to find a clever way to meet the letter of the law as well given the new technologies in this case the spirit of the  investor rule is to prevent large number of investors from acting as a coordinated group without “being public” so the sec has had many many years to plug every possible letterofthelaw loophole the specific legal language doesn’t refer to funds – it refers to “organized groups” and the sec considers that to mean they look through any legal structure you pick to see whether the group is organized as a single group or not splitting investments into parallel funds or by groups of “upstream” funds as suggested in the comments here is already said by the sec to count all investors i suspect this one may need a law change to address jasonmendelson i agree the integration issues that sec makes part of the issue kills us perhaps a noaction letter is due sean schantzen have you found a way that a no action letter could help with this the limit comes from the investment company act and is in the statute itself which i don’t think a no action letter could change i don’t know anyway around it without running into integration issues maybe a creative no action letter that addresses just integration since integration isn’t in the statute but the sec would really have to be on board with syndicates we’ve been trying to find a work around for this too but came to the same conclusions if someone goes down the no action letter road we’d be happy to be involved and help out jasonmendelson i haven’t found a way it’s just a theory if the sec won’t bust us we are clean but this is a very broad topic that a no action letter might not work for sean schantzen thanks the whole  investor limit seems like a relic just like the  investor reporting limit it would be great to at least increase it by the same x the  investor limit was regardless of whether by no action letter or statute change jasonmendelson agreed dl jlm outlined the direction sproutrhouse is looking for a solution brad where has this path led you since angel list began offering syndicates i have been working to solve a variation of this problem to serve earlystage companies privately at sproutrhouse sproutrhouse offers natural cpg brands a simple crowd funding solution but it’s a k investment that the market is seeking and one sproutrhouse is wellsuited to address jasonmendelson we’ve actually only been led to the ideas that brad describes above i have a feeling we are headed toward a request for a sec noaction letter but the issue might be too broad and need legislative action carlos does a series llc work not available in cali but who wants to do business there anyway 😉 stackexchange i am exploring using a series llc in a novel way to promote investment into a core technology where each individual “app” of this core technology could be its own company separates investors liability minimizes paperwork and above all fees right would this be something you guys would entertain in funding in my case hoping that this could be useful in this case as well this afterall was given birth via the mutual fund industry per wikipedia httpsenwikipediaorgwikiseriesllc jasonmendelson well unfortunately we need to be able to do business in ca so no and if you make the company split up like that you get pass through taxes to the investors which doesn’t work either thanks for the idea jmn if section c is not amended the  investor limit could severally undermine the jobs act’s on several levels the accredited investor verification requirements as defined by the jobs act should be sufficient foundation to argue a  investor cap – in line with the max number of ai’s a private company can introduce as shareholders a noaction letter may work if the sec’s fully aware its efforts surrounding the jobs act could be vein bfeld yup it feels like one possible solution is a noaction letter but this ultimately is a oneoff per organization eg angellist so it doesn’t really solve the overall problem jmn although a oneoff result the outcome would set a precedent assisting other organizations startups small investors the other option is a collective effort to force an amendment to section c if common sense prevailed the upside benefits far outweigh the downside risk if the investor cap was increased in line with allowable shareholders letting companies decide the weighting subject to ai’s being certified pursuant to title ii riverland could this be relevant or helpful httpsverifyinvestorcom bfeld sort of angellist is doing this for free however – see httpswwwfeldcomarchivesangellistaccreditationreporthtml jor law hi cofounder of verifyinvestorcom and angellist fan here what we do is similar to what angellist provides but they have a limited use case while ours is a more reliable and comprehensive solution their solution is great for their platform i think but ours is something that can be relied upon by companies their advisorsprofessionals and investors who need certainty of compliance jor law somehow my other post got removed but i did want to add that httpsverifyinvestorcom doesn’t currently address the investment company act and  invest limit issue it’s more a solution relating to general solicitation and c objectmethodologycom sounds like we need an “ownership act” something that let’s people in the us a country based on freedom be free to do as they please scott welcome to my world brad the company act and the investor slot issues are a real pain in the ass as you’ve discovered if you structure your vehicles as c vehicles by including only qps you’ll be ok it’s actually pretty easy if you must accommodate accredited investors look into registered investment company “ric” structures a closed end ric essentially a ’ act closedend mutual fund structure allows you to aggregate accredited investor capital in a private vehicle it’s not a free lunch – you’ll need to be registered have an independent board have thirdparty admin etc on the plus side its fairly permanent capital liquidity with gating is flexible and offers the ability to reinvest proceeds or dividend out proceeds and is well traveled ground you should look into it there is a cost but if the money you’re aggregating is big enough it could make sense bfeld yup – we know this well – and have no interest in going down this path that’s not – in our mind – the goals of the jobs act nor is it how we approach our world in general which is why a we’ve never done this sort of thing in the past and b we are intrigued and excited about the ground angellist is plowing felix dashevsky this issue arises because you are double pooling investors given the electroniceasy nature of angellist closing process i question the need for a separate syndicate llc let the investors invest directly into startups and play with startup funding docs to ensure streamlined future interaction with investors or use power of attorney advisory contract or solve it technologically the issue such direct structure would highlight is your and angellist’s fee however i think you can structure around it optionswarrants at opco investment advisory contract something else creative if it is an advisory contract you’ll run into investment advisory act and “qualified client” issues… but frankly i am not sure how you or angellist have avoided these so far bfeld if i was on the startup side i wouldn’t want this regardless of the legal docs there will be at least one situation where you have to chase down signatures and that could be the nightmare we’ve focused very hard on the legal dynamics around iaa and are very comfortable but really understanding it has been nontrivial felix dashevsky but isn’t that what the jobs act was about like the  limit you alluded to in the opening paragraph “a lot of fanfare around … the increase in the number of shareholders a private company could have” or the crowdfunding bits it wasn’t about broader access to fundlike structures but to startups if startups want just a couple of big investors… well we don’t need the jobs act at all if we step back nothing we are discussing was in fact affected by the jobs act–fg angels is using the “old” b pathway bfeld since we are using b you are correct which means that the jobs acts is not accomplishing the goal felix dashevsky which was what felix dashevsky my point is that neither the jobs act nor any other rule on startup fundraising is causing any issue here the “problem” is not endemic to startup investing like the “problem” is bfeld i guess i just disagree if you’ve been following what we’ve tried to do with fg angel it’s very much about democratizing startup investing and the  investor rule is a huge disconnect from the jobs act goals especially in raising the private investor cap from  to  felix dashevsky fair enough i am following fg angel by backing it although not sure if i will make it into the  the next time jmn brad i concur with your position the question is what can be done to resolve this hurdle there’s always a solution jason best and team at crowdfund capital advisors httpscrowdfundcapitaladvisorscomaboutusourteamjasonbesthtml may be a starting point jmn it appears my previous comment was removed because a link to a third party’s website was included a private company found on the net that was involved with pushing the jobs act legislation through my point was there’s sure to be a solution to this problem but it’s going to take some digging and talking to the right people who can push for change at the legislative level otherwise the “ investor problem” is here to stay there’s no way around it eddie wharton could you have a  person bradfg angels llc another  person jasonfg angels llc etc instead of combining them off the cap table just include  different llc’s it would be a bit more work is not a scalable solution past a certain point and relies enormously on the trust that you have built to make sure all of the fg angel llc make the exact same investments with the same terms this is not an effective solution for everybody and one part of the law seems to undermine the spirit of another big picture that needs to be fixed however this could be a way to keep fg angels growing and still have a low single digit number of additions to the cap table jasonmendelson i wish sec would look into “who is brad  jason” and realize we are partners and then game over they integrate and we are “done” joe wallin i think we ought to just repeal the investment company act… steve consilvio stop investing and give your money away i love it how rich prigs think they are helping others by lending them money and then sucking the blood out of a new business you guys should be ashamed of yourselves fred destin my personal view is that we do this one step at a time and prove we are responsible actors on a functional platform the  investor problem could also refer to  when retail investors were left holding cats in bags prepared for them by professional investors let’s build a strong platform with good diligence tools social signals evidence of track record and then go back and propose the next regulatory evolution i am convinced there is a day where crowdfunding will apply to startups as it applies to products on kickstarter but we need to make sure it’s done well let’s celebrate the deregulation demonstrate our platform works and then fight for the next step bfeld fair enough however when the  shareholder limit was raised to  i don’t think anyone was paying attention to the  llc rule if there was thoughtful discussion about it that’s cool but my instinct is that there wasn’t and that’s what’s frustrating  disappointing to me i think the gang at angellist was just as surprised by this based on all of our work together since you are investors directly in angellist realizing that their initial view was there was no problem having larger syndicates is probably important as part of understanding how this all evolves as we planned from the beginning the fg angels experiment is just that – an experiment – so we are happy to find all the limitations edge cases and problems i don’t think our behavior or performance is – or should be – a proxy for regulators as we are merely one data point so i’m happy to be public about all the challenges we run into steven kane hi brad re the chasing signatures issue couldnt the startup simply require angels who invest directly to submit to some kind of “drag along” right meaning once the angel’s money is invested no signatures are ever required ever again bfeld possibly it’s one of the approaches we’ve looked at we – and some of the companies we’ve talked to – aren’t comfortable with it since it still ends up with a huge number of individual investors on the cap table lunarmobiscuit the investment act and sec seems to have thought through every straightforward workaround given that it seems the best path is to go back and questions the assumptions you set up this llc to a simplify the paperwork for the investees b centralize the decision making of the syndicate c prove out the angellist crowdfunding model of these only a is limited by the rules i saw in the comments that the rules don’t allow you to run one llc and any of your foundry partners to run a second llc but what stops any of the other  people in the syndicate from setting up a second llc a “notfg angels llc” whose manager receives no communications from you but who watches angellist to see what fg angels invests in and follows along you pick  others to be part of fg angels and someone from the other  others not picked can choose  more for notfg angels llc and so on with trulynotfg angels until you hit the  investor limit which i believe really has no workaround bfeld that’s a valid hack and certainly open to anyone who wants to do it rxdxt this is richard titus founder of promptly foundry syndicate investment  chiming in… i agree this is a real problem promptly was super excited about the opportunity  the democratic innovation in investment – but we were surprised the final investment amount was so much lower than commitments it all worked out as we were significantly oversubscribed via direct investment perhaps syndicates could “back each other up” ie each syndicate could act as a “submanager” to investors who are interested in a deal but cannot fit into the st  investors of the original syndicator i’d be happy to serve in this capacity for foundry it should be noted we and i hope you don’t mind we did this “picked off” some of the obviously qp investors and invited them to invest directly to allow more people into the deal – but until the sec  irs solve this that seemed the best way to preserve access – to our view the purpose of angellist is to level the playing field for investors – particularly smaller ones and diversify the investment landscape based on my fantastic experience as an entrepreneur being backed by foundry  it’s syndicate – i’ve started my own thanks again bfeld we’re glad you picked off additional qp investors to invest directly all good… henry glover what if the  members pooled together to form a firm with m in assets making one “qualified purchaser” might be silly for one deal but if you had a lot of people in a “firm” it basically makes the firm a really large syndicate im guessing it would require either bigger checks more people  a lot of deals for it to scale… vc firm bfeld that won’t work as the entity will have   investors scott kosch brad i’m in your syndicate and make the  cutoff because of my perdeal amount but i also qualify as a qp just got around to getting a letter from a financial institution to attest to this but in the online form it also mentions that they might periodically run my credit history i don’t like the idea of having my credit run frequently like possibly for every deal or even a few times per year because this negatively impacts credit scores which i think is crazy can you say anything about this i hate to fill an accredited spot when i could be included as a qp but the periodic credit check gave me pause bfeld i don’t know the answer to this specifically but will check scott kosch brad thanks for asking al about this here is what i learned so that others don’t shy away from validating their qp status the credit check they perform is called a “soft pull” add your own joke to that it does not impact your credit score unlike a “hard pull” nevertheless if you still want to avoid this repeated credit check for each deal there are two ways al may not need to check as frequently first if you invest through an entity which is whollyowned by one or more qps then that entity is a qp and they shouldn’t need to run your credit personally second if you can verify that your net worth is greater than m and not just your net assets ie your net worth would be less debt and other liabilities then credit checks aren’t necessary anyway happy that i can make room for one more investor by changing my status tejdhawan that’s an interesting observation you’re correct that the credit score would likely by hit by the credit check the credit report would generally affirm the salary based qualification requirements but not the remaining  or  as financial assets nonprofit work institutional mgmt etc don’t make it into credit checks the criminalbankruptcy items that do make it into credit checks would apply to the companies raising the funding through fg angelssyndicate interesting question to send to al directly as well and this is making me think that the company raising the funds should also be providing

various services that startups consumed including fundraising and talent acquisition angellist had recently launched two products with the aim to upend the early stage investment and recruiting industries earlier in september  angellist had launched syndicates a product that enabled the best early stage investors to pool their own capital with that from a group of “backers” to make larger investments in startups angellist had built a nearly completely automated online interface to facilitate these transactions removing much of the transaction costs and administrative friction that previously made these types of investments difficult syndicates allowed more investors to access early stage investments and to diversify their investment budget to amounts as low as  per startup over  syndicate deals that had been completed on angellist by april  however these were just the tip of the iceberg to ravikant he commented the world that i see coming is one in which a highquality investor goes and meets with a startup when they decide to invest they pull up their ipad they sign their name with their finger and they swipe a debit card others who believe in this investor’s

now in april  ravikant was working hard to grow the pool of capital behind angellist’s syndicate leads he hoped that in the future both retail investors and institutional investors would be able to investment through syndicates in fact syndicates would be a means for institutional investors to directly access earlystage deals and bypass middlemen—fundoffunds and even venture capital funds—and their management and performancebased fees since december  angellist had also started to monetize its talent portal which for some time had been making free matches between candidates on its platform and talenthungry technology companies angellist estimated that it was making approximately  matches resulting in  hires each week angellist talent had developed a reputation for delivering highquality leads to both candidates and employers and it was being used by both startups and laterstaged technology companies such as yelp and uber as of april  angellist was charging companies  per fulltime hire made through the platform a small fraction of prevailing recruiting fees ravikant wondered what other types of matches he could help startups make for example connecting them with lawyers accountants and even customers ravikant was excited by the potential of angellist the platform had already brought several innovations to the early stage investment ecosystem now the question was whether angellist could execute its full vision and make an even bigger “dent in the universe” company background angellist was founded by naval ravikant and babak nivi in  as a platform to connect entrepreneurs in need of seed funding with angel investors angellist was an extension of venture hacks a blog authored by ravikant and nivi to educate entrepreneurs on the ins and outs of starting a

course of completing his phd when he decided to change direction and pursue a career as a venture capital investor nivi worked as an associate at seed capital partners and also as an entrepreneurinresidence eir at bessemer and atlas venture in  nivi became a vice president at songbird an atlas ventures portfolio company nivi had a growing realization that there was a great asymmetry of information between entrepreneurs and investors venture capital investors were almost always more sophisticated and knew more about fundraising than entrepreneurs and the two parties’ interests were not always aligned venture hacks while nivi was working for songbird ravikant advised him on how to manage the fundraising process and conduct negotiations with investors the duo decided to start venture hacks a blog that would distill the advice that ravikant had given nivi and other entrepreneurs over time posts covered a variety of useful topics including “how to pick a cofounder” and “how to make a cap table” venture hacks became a popular resource for entrepreneurs looking to understand the process of starting a company nivi and ravikant found themselves fielding frequent requests for referrals to investors the two soon realized that entrepreneurs needed more than advice—they were also hungry for introductions to investors ravikant empathized with entrepreneurs in this area he commented companies were connecting with investors in a very inefficient and slow manner introductions were made onebyone and then everybody would hoard introductions like they were this magic currency this is because when an investor finds a company they want to keep it to themselves they want to basically lock the deal down make sure it doesn’t have a lot of

introductions we believed that if you’re a highquality startup you should meet everybody and everybody should want to meet with you why should you be restricted to the few people you’ve been able to talk to in february  the venture hacks founders launched angellist which they announced as “a curated list of super highquality angel investors and how to reach them” the site debuted with over  angels but quickly grew to  as additional investors created profiles angellist became a platform where startups and investors created profiles and could follow each other send private messages or request an introduction see exhibit  in july  eighteen months into its existence angellist announced that it had made  introductions between investors and startups of those introductions  resulted in investments one entrepreneur described the experience of fundraising through the platform recently using angellist has changed the way ive been fundraising where traditionally ive had to dedicate a block of time to fundraise full time i can now fundraise passively meaning just by focusing on having an optimized angellist presence and a few specific techniques i dont have to spend blocks of my time finding highquality angels that is a game changer for us—fundraising is an incredibly distracting process and its especially hard to innovate and iterate on your startup when youre distracted by bolstering the companys bank account being able to have angels come to me has given me a freedom as an entrepreneur thats just fantastic by the end of  there were some  companies  of which were raising money and  accredited investors on angellist searching for a business model as angellist grew rapidly ravikant and nivi began to think about how they could turn the platform into a business angellist had already accomplished bringing both startups and investors together online the next challenge was to figure out the best way to monetize the connections that were being made on the platform while continuing to deliver on their mission of helping entrepreneurs and startups  babak nivi “launch angellist a curated list of angel investors” venture hacks february

capital and entrepreneurial management  han spring  university of pennsylvania any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited angellist changing the landscape of investing e p  transaction fee angellist decided against charging either investors or startups or both a transaction fee for several reasons first us financial regulations required angellist to become a broker dealer in order to charge a transaction fee but broker dealers were highly regulated by the government ravikant stated “being a broker dealer means you have all these regulations and requirements that actually make it impossible to work with startups” further the founders believed that there was a high likelihood of adverse selection if angellist were to charge a transaction fee both highquality startups and investors who needed angellist less to access each other could choose to leave the platform in order to avoid the fee ravikant and nivi wanted to maximize the participation of both companies and investors on the platform finally charging a transaction fee was at the time difficult to implement because the fundraising activity that happened after the angellist introductions was completed offline identifying and getting access to highquality startups—a very small fraction of startups on angellist were of investment quality—was a highly competitive process for investors as such while investors were happy to browse and get introduced to companies many took to using telephone email and in person meetings thereafter investors were hesitant to make public their interest in a startup eg by following them until posttransaction because they did not want others to discover the company due to investors’ preference to conduct investment activity off the angellist platform the company was aware of approximately only half of all closed transactions that resulted from its introductions angellist gathered transaction data primarily by indirect means ash fontana who worked on angellist’s fundraising products commented on how the platform tracked investment activity in its early days we heard anecdotes but we also tried to automate it a bit we’d ping the founders when they got a lot of intros to say “hey you should add these folks as your investors” alternatively we’d see the investor later add themselves and then we’d see that they’d previously gotten an intro so we could infer that the investment was made as a result of an angellist introduction invest online in december  angellist launched a partnership with secondmarket an online marketplace with broker dealer status secondmarket allowed investors to buy and sell illiquid assets online including limited partnership interests and private company stock the partnership with secondmarket was a test of an investment vehicle—an llc comprised of a group of investors each individually contributing a small amount the llc pooled the capital the investors and as a single

entrepreneurial management  han spring  university of pennsylvania any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited angellist changing the landscape of investing e p  angellist piloted invest online with  startups on its platform to ensure the quality of the companies in the pilot each startup had to have a lead investor willing to invest  a sum that the company leadership considered to be the equivalent of a vote of confidence from a community member with credibility the minimum total investment by the llc vehicle was  therefore aside from the lead investor there had to be at least an additional  of interest from other investors who accepted the terms prenegotiated by the lead only accredited investors could participate in these transactions in a press report ravikant commented on the benefits of invest online for startups instead of raising offline you could get the bulk of your capital online without hassle and you could incorporate both small and large supporters in a round without complication there were significant transaction costs and other frictions associated with the invest online model including creating the llc and transferring money from all the investors into one account additionally a high level of coordination was needed to move a large group of investors through the process secondmarket initially handled all of the back office operations angellist estimated that it paid approximately  in legal and administrative fees per startup that fundraised using invest online over the next several months angellist automated each step of creating marketing and closing an invest online transaction by building its own back office and funds management capabilities angellist was able to reduce the transaction costs by nearly  percent these included automating the tasks of bank account creation and the document signing regulatory relief in response to the stock market crash of  it had been illegal since the early s for american companies to fundraise publicly known as engaging in “general solicitation” companies raising funds through private offerings ie not through an initial public offering on the stock market were limited to word of mouth and other forms of private communications as means of marketing their fundraising activity these financial regulations had been crafted over  years previously with the aim of preventing companies from taking advantage of unsophisticated investors so called “widowers and orphans” the ban on general solicitation put many startup fundraisingrelated activities including those that took place in incubators and various online crowdfunding platforms in regulatory gray areas although angellist did not engage in crowdfunding and only worked with accredited investors the regulatory environment was nevertheless something of which the company had to be mindful in march  angellist received a “no action” letter from the us securities and exchange commission sec which served as assurance that invest online later rebranded as syndicates would not trigger enforcement action from the sec additionally the sec confirmed that angellist could earn a performancebased fee ie a carry without brokerdealer status under  accredited investors are sophisticated investors that have wealth or income levels above a certain threshold the us government deems that only accredited investors can make certain types of investments this document is authorized for use by neha budhraja from  to  in the course mgmt   venture capital and entrepreneurial management  han spring  university of pennsylvania any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited angellist changing the landscape of investing e p  an exemption for venture capital investors fontana commented on the difference between performancebased and transactionbased compensation when angellist receives a carry from investors it is considered performancebased compensation and not transactionbased as in we dont make more money necessarily just based on doing more volume and we dont make money based on exactly how much investors are investing we make money if investors make money based on the performance of the investment further in july  the sec voted to implement a section of the jumpstart our business startups jobs act which lifted the ban on general solicitation with a great part of the regulatory uncertainty lifted angellist moved forward with scaling invest online fundraising in september  angellist raised  million in financing industry press reported that the valuation was approximately  million google ventures and atlas ventures led the round but over  other investors participated as well these included both several large venture capital funds including draper fisher jurvetson and kleiner perkins as well as dozens of angel investors angellist completed its own fundraising using syndicates which it had debuted in the same month syndicates syndicates allowed a lead investor to bring other investors into a prenegotiated transaction with a startup a syndicate lead had a band of “backers”—other angellist investors who made a nonbinding commitment to invest in deals that the lead set up syndicate leads earned a carry of zero percent to  percent from backers for each transaction angellist would also earn a  percent carry from backers for facilitating the transaction for example ben davenport an early stage investor and software engineer at facebook led a syndicate to invest in bitcoin companies as of march  davenport’s backers had soft committed  to davenport’s investments on his profile davenport stated that he expected his bitcoin syndicate to invest in six deals per year in each of these transactions davenport expected he would contribute  while backers would contribute a minimum of  each to make up the balance of the investment the minimum total investment size set by angellist for syndicates transactions was  backers of each of davenport’s deals would pay him a  percent carry and angellist a  percent carry davenport’s syndicate page included the following description of why investors should back him i have been

building the next layers on top of the base protocol my angel investments are not exclusively in bitcoin startups but they will be the focus for this syndicate another example was karl jacob an angel investor who led another syndicate on angellist jacob’s syndicate profile stated “i have proprietary deal flow and i am often the first call an entrepreneur makes to raise funds in two recent deals i was the only angel asked to invest…i will try to syndicate all my deals” as of april  jacob had eight backers whose backings totaled  jacob expected that he would lead  syndicate deals per year with a typical investment from him of  and a minimum backer investment of  backers paid jacob a  percent carry and angellist a  percent carry as of april  startups had raised over  million through  completed syndicates deals and  active syndicates had made at least one investment in a startup fontana estimated that the average syndicate transaction was close to  and that the average backer invested approximately  per transaction how syndicates worked currently angellist carefully screened each potential syndicate deal to ensure it had a high likelihood of closing to assess a deal’s viability angellist considered factors including the number of backers behind the syndicate lead angellist also considered whether the lead had negotiated an investment allocation with a startup that had limited access or was even oversubscribed if so the syndicate lead would be providing some of high value to backers once a deal was syndicated on angellist the lead’s backers automatically received a “reservation” to invest in the startup up to this point backers could still choose not to participate while other investors on angellist that were not backers could also join angellist sometimes helped market the deal by featuring it on the syndicates web page additionally other investors could also discover and join the deal if they were following an existing backer if the interest level exceeded the lead’s allocation then the lead and sometimes the startup curated the list of final investors with priority generally going to the syndicate’s backers the process of filling up a syndicate transaction varied significantly with some deals being oversubscribed early on and others requiring up to six to eight weeks of marketing the finalized set of investors then joined angellist’s online closing environment an investment vehicle was formed and a bank account was started where investors wired their money angellist never directly touched the money investors also completed legal and administrative paperwork online as of april  this process could take several weeks   “back ben’s syndicate” angellist httpsangelcobendavenportsyndicate april   “back karl’s

university of pennsylvania any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited angellist changing the landscape of investing e p  depending on how quickly backers were able to complete all the necessary steps speed to close was a competitive advantage for early stage investors—syndicates that were dragging their feet to close risked being displaced by another investor if the startup became impatient as such angellist was working on shortening the time to close by automating as many steps as possible the platform was also considering moving towards having backers prefund accounts for their syndicates in lieu of the current softcommitment model syndicate leads syndicates allowed certain investors to put more money to work in companies that they had identified and to earn a carry for providing other investors with access leads were also able to invest in a larger universe of companies and were better positioned to negotiate with them as a result of being able to write larger checks many wellknown and wellconnected angel investors quickly launched syndicates on angellist as did lowerprofile investors such as those that were employed at leading technology companies who had a good pulse on startups that were being formed within their networks angellist helped these investors gain greater reach by featuring their syndicates additionally some early stage and venture capital investment funds as well as incubators also started syndicates these included foundry group social leverage llc and  startups also general partners of several venture funds also started syndicates under their own name brad feld managing director at foundry group commented in a blog post after joking that every vc venture capitalist in the us was at this moment discussing angellist and how it might or might not impact them we decided to do something rather than talk we decided to participate after discussing a few different ways to engage we decided to form fg angels through which we’ll be an active funder on angellist angellist believed that funds and incubators were starting syndicates because identifying and vetting startups was a resourceintensive process and syndicates allowed them to leverage their brands to put more capital to work fontana predicted that some early stage funds would effectively transfer their seed investment programs onto angellist syndicate investors investors reaped several benefits by investing through syndicates backers were able to access indemand startups and leverage the due diligence conducted by the lead investor syndicates also had no management fees and often a lower total carry compared to early stage investment funds which typically charged a  to  percent annual management fee in addition to a  percent carry with minimum investments from backers starting at  angellist also enabled more individuals to become early stage investors additionally existing investors could also diversify their investment budget over a larger set of companies  for a complete list of syndicates on angellist see httpsangelcosyndicates brad feld “angellist – do or do not there is no try” foundry group october

downsides for investors regarding the behavior of investing in deals discovered socially on angellist mark suster a venture capital investor commented “social proof can be helpful but it can also be destructive it certainly shouldn’t be a proxy for good judgment” hunter walk who managed a seed stage venture fund wrote a blog post titled “angellist syndicates will also pit angel against angel” walk predicted that since syndicate leads commanded larger check sizes there would be fewer spots for angels investing in smaller amounts in any given transaction which would increase competition between angels going forward startups with syndicated investors syndicates had several nearterm benefits for startups but also possibly some longterm drawbacks that were difficult to predict because of the short track record of the investment model syndicates allowed a startup to raise money from a large group of investors but only interface with the lead investor investments were completed through a hasslefree online interface startups with a small amount of space left in their fundraising round could also have multiple investors participate through a syndicate which was particularly valuable when a verticalfocused group such as the bitcoin syndicate could bring many experts within one vehicle these specialized syndicates were quickly becoming musthave investors for startups in some verticals with the ability to invest larger amounts angel investors could better compete with venture capital funds in larger financing rounds allowing companies to be funded by angel investors for longer periods of their life this was significant because angel investors had a reputation of being more “startup” friendly than venture capital funds one reason for the perception was that some venture capital funds managed large pools of capital from institutional investors and were not incentivized to provide portfolio companies with attention and support unless they had the potential to be homeruns that could move the needle on the fund’s returns angel investors typically invested their personal capital and were perceived to want to work with startups out of a balance of personal interest and financial gains however pundits also warned of potential negative consequences for startups that take investments from syndicates semil shah a technology columnist and investor wrote on his blog that “founders will need to stay vigilant about the benefitsrisks of having their leads syndicate to retail level” shah questioned the ability of certain types of syndicates especially those formed by large and disparate groups of investors to provide startups with support and bridge financing during difficult times angellist pointed out that the vast majority of syndicate  mark suster

highly screened for their ability to add value thus mitigating the risk that shah brought up maiden lane in march  industry press reported that a firm named maiden lane the street in san francisco where angellist’s office was then located had raised a  million fund to invest in angellist syndicates laws angellist’s coo would be a partner of maiden lane and ravikant would be on the fund’s investment committee maiden lane was a fund backed by institutional investors and was designed to allow them to access early stage companies without the fees associated with typical seed funds instead maiden lane’s limited partners would make investments through angellist’s syndicate leads which ravikant believed were the bestpositioned and besttrained people to identify and evaluate early stage investments maiden lane would have no management fee further while the fund would earn a carry from its investors the carry would be distributed to the syndicate leads ravikant elaborated maiden lane will create a new breed of microventure capitalists syndicate leads who don’t charge management fees and who lead with their own capital institutional investors can track and trace them every step of the way and an investor can fire and hire a lead with one click on their dashboard and on the other side the syndicate leads are now managers who can start or stop investing at any time they can raise their carry if they are successful they can pull in more funds every single day they don’t have to be locked in to the status quo fundraising cycle and fund structure maiden lane and angellist create a dynamic smooth liquid market for venture capital at the early stages where today no market exists maiden lane was ravikant’s vision for the future of early stage investing under existing industry standards institutional investors often paid several layers of management and performancefees to access early stage companies if successful maiden lanelike investment vehicles would allow investors to pay only one performancebased fee to syndicate leads selfsyndication in april  angellist launched selfsyndication—a variation on syndicates where startups can create syndicate on their own selfsyndication required a startup to have a  commitment from a highquality investor however selfsyndicated startups had no lead investor and backers of a selfsyndicated startup paid  percent carry to

candidates and companies since august  talent began as a byproduct of the fundraising platform when startups that failed to fundraise or otherwise fizzled began to approach the angellist team for ideas on their next steps angellist recognized that many of the founders from these failed startups were highly employable developers that were needed by other startups that were successful and hungry for more talent kyan pardiwalla an angellist engineer took on the project of building a product to connect the talent from startups that didn’t make it with startups that did angellist talent was composed of profiles of companies and available jobs and profiles of candidates angellist made matches between companies and candidates by having both sides evaluate each other using a yesno interface candidate could browse jobs on the site angellist’s site described the different ways candidates could respond to job postings when you press “yes im interested” the startup is notified if they click “yes” on your profile too we do an email introduction…add a note to the startup with a few words on why youd be a great fit when you press “no archive” the startup is not notified and they never see your profile you can press ☆ to add the startup to your starred list and return to it later startups can see how many times youve clicked “yes” in the last  days pardiwalla designed angellist talent to maximize the opportunity for matches to occur and to eliminate what he termed “recruiter spam” which was typical of existing talent platforms pardiwalla commented i was pretty personally dissatisfied how recruiting in the industry was happening and how many unwanted communications i received from recruiters i thought it was just not the best way the world could work for example on most online services i am just one of a large pile of résumés that recruiters who have paid  to  a month have access to all they do is search for the term “ruby” in those resumes and maybe i did a ruby project at some point in the past and now i get all this spam for the rest of my life so its not really the best way for recruiting to work angellist asked candidates to fill out profiles with the aim of accurately and succinctly summarizing “what a person was all about” the profile collected and structured information such as education and employment history and also links to projects that candidates had completed see exhibit  further candidates were asked to provide a “headline” about themselves as well as description of their most impressive accomplishment additionally companies could see how many times a candidate had said “yes” to a job posting within the last  days which let them know the candidate’s level of selectivity this document is authorized for use by neha budhraja from

changing the landscape of investing e p  companies provided information on the product founders funding and level of traction they also wrote an answer to the prompt “why us” and included the salary and equity range for each job posted angellist also identified and put in a special section jobs that were from candidates’ personal networks angellist also added privacy controls which were designed to make candidates feel comfortable about creating a talent profile without drawing the attention of their existing employers investors and coworkers candidates could label themselves as “actively looking” “just browsing” or even “secret” if a candidate created a secret profile only startups that she had said “yes” to could view the profile monetizing angellist talent initially angellist provided talent introductions for free the product had been designed to “make the intro and get out of the way” however by december  angellist was making almost  introductions on a weekly basis and the platform was generating very positive user feedback from the technology community one company that had successfully recruited through angellist wrote the following glowing review on the questionandanswer community website quora angellist talent is the best kept secret in hiring—although probably not for long we found our serverside architect our rf radio frequency engineer and our hopefullysoontobe ux user experience lead via angellist…the quality of the talent has been really high and most importantly everyone weve interacted with has had very realistic expectations about what a role in a startup implies which has been refreshing part of it is due to the quality of companies and people on al angellist but imo in my opinion it is also due to the lack of anonymity and lack of any contrived gamificationpointsratings systems on the site another user commented my own theory is al is different because it doesnt focus on what a startup will do but rather focuses on what a startup is doing for example screen shots demonstrations lists of team members founders advisors  investors id take a  page al profile over a  page business plan every day of the week angellist decided to test charging companies for hires through angellist introductions market research showed that recruiters typically charged companies approximately  percent of the first year’s salaries per hire that they enabled or approximately  per hire and up to  for a very senior level hire  “what do people think about angellist talent” quora

pricing model where companies could choose to pay either  percent of the first year salary or  percent of equity the equity payment had been designed to help small startups that did not have very much

profile tags it currently only charged companies that confirmed by email in an honorbased system the company was also looking forward to growing its talent profiles to functions and roles beyond its current demographics which were skewed towards developers and designers for example angellist would like to see more profiles for sales and marketing and business candidates helping cofounders identify and connect with each other too was a goal looking forward ravikant was proud of how angellist had helped numerous startups raise money and make key hires over the previous several years in the process angellist products had also increased the access investors had to deals and enabled the most successful investors build their own investment businesses ravikant was also excited by the potential of angellist to further transform the landscape of early stage investing syndicates had many growth opportunities including entering new verticals such as real estate and entertainment penetrating geographies outside silicon valley and covering later stage financing rounds angellist was also working hard to persuade institutional investors to adopt this new investment channel which could save them several layers of fees already there was some traction as demonstrated by the maiden lane fund however ravikant also kept in mind several risks and uncertainties that angellist would need to weather these included the regulatory risk that would likely always be an overhang although angellist had received a “no action” letter from the sec which had provided a reasonable amount of comfort ravikant was nevertheless aware that he was operating in a highly regulated industry there was execution risk as well to scale syndicates angellist needed to accelerate the speed with which deals could be completed on the platform ravikant had already noticed some venture capital investors trying to displace syndicates in transactions that were taking too long to close these investors tried to persuade startups who were in the process of a syndicates transaction on angellist to take money for other sources instead to that end the company was trying to move towards a prefunded account approach which would ensure that funds moved quickly once a syndicate lead decided to invest this document is authorized for use by neha budhraja from  to  in the course mgmt   venture capital

angellist was also vulnerable to the timing of the end of the current cycle of economic growth when that time came there would be a pullback in investors’ appetites for new investments as such the best time for angellist to gain traction with institutional investors would be while the cycle was still in its upward phase could ravikant and his team execute on the scaling of syndicates within this window the pullback would also be a test of how investors on the platform would behave in angellist’s first trough laws believed that angellist investors were better capitalized than the industry on average and would weather the downturn relatively well the sentiment of the community towards angellist as a social platform though it had been positive to date was also unpredictable laws commented we are riding a social wave that we don’t have control over we don’t have the numbers to know what the market we’re growing into is and so i don’t even know when we start to top out it’s all a social phenomenon that we’re a part of and you always have this little thought “what if it stops” in the back of your mind if it was another type of business i can turn up the marketing spend and get more growth our levers here are amorphous—we are serving the community better to keep the growth going for the previous several years angellist had undergone a period of significant growth and of innovation in products however it was still possible that the platform could lose its popularity if powerful investors turned against it naysayers had cropped up once in a while but so far none had managed to sway the community away from the platform despite the risks and uncertainties however ravikant was excited as he looked towards angellist’s future he wondered how early stage investing would continue to transform over the next  to  years and what angellist’s role would be in that process this document is authorized for use by neha budhraja from  to  in the course mgmt   venture

section what is angellist angellist is a platform for startups to meet investors candidates and incubators it was started in jan  by babak nivi and naval ravikant who also write venture hacks how are the investors on angellist verified all the investors have stated that they are accredited the vast majority of the investors have also made several angel investments you should verify that every investor you raise money from is accredited whether or not you use angellist and you should treat each investor you meet on angellist as if you just met them on the street we give you information about each investor and display the source of that information but we dont claim that theyre good people how do i contact investors you can message anyone who follows you or your startup you can also message anyone who requests an intro to your startup next you can ask people on your team to forward your messages to their followers and the angellist team may also give you permission to message certain people finally you can message anyone who messages you first how do i prevent investors from stealing my idea if youre obviously fundable eg you previously started a company that made lots of money for its investors dont add a lot of information to your profile if youre not obviously fundable consider the risk of sharing your idea to be a cost of doing business if youre not willing to take

landscape of investing e p  exhibit  excerpts from angellist’s syndicates help section what is a syndicate a syndicate allows investors to coinvest with other notable investors people who back a notable investors syndicate commit to invest in their future deals and agree to pay them carry what are the benefits of syndicates backers get access to dealflow leads get carry and startups get access to capital backers get access to the leads dealflow and benefit from her experience in picking and managing investments backers can invest much less than the startups minimum for a direct investment leads get carry and leverage on their personal investments they get to invest x their typical investment amount which gives them access to more deals allows them to lead more deals and provides access to startups with higher minimum commitments their larger investment amounts may also bring major investor rights finally leads get access to their backers networks so they can provide additional value to their investments startups get more capital with fewer meetings they get the attention of an investor who is committing x their typical investment they get access to the backers networks without putting each one on the cap table and they can collect many small investments without a lot of hassle how do syndicates work heres an example sara a notable angel decides to lead a syndicate investors ‘back’ her syndicate by agreeing to invest k in each of her future deals and pay her a  carry the next time sara decides to invest in a startup she asks the company for a k allocation she personally invests k in the startup and offers an opportunity to invest up to k to her backers can investors who dont back a lead still invest in that leads deals yes nonbackers can make reservations in syndicated deals very much like making a reservation in a company that is accepting online investments nonbackers invest in the same fund as the backers and the syndicate lead nonbackers also pay the same carry as the backers when a deal is oversubscribed backer reservations generally have priority over nonbacker reservations what do syndicates cost backers pay  carry per deal to the syndicate lead and  to angellist startups pay nothing as long as the syndicate fund closes above  otherwise either the lead or the company pays a onetime fee that covers the legal and administrative costs of closing the fund and managing it for its lifetime this document is authorized for use by neha budhraja from  to  in the course mgmt   venture capital and entrepreneurial management  han spring  university of pennsylvania any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited angellist changing the landscape of investing e p  whats the legal structure for a syndicate syndicate investors dont invest directly in the company but a special purpose vehicle llc that is created for each specific investment the fund is managed by assure fund management and advised by the lead and angellist advisors llc a whollyowned subsidiary of angellist angellist advisors and the lead receive the carried interest as special members of the syndicate the lead is required to advise the fund tell the fund how they voted or would vote their shares and if they buy or sell shares the fund will generally follow unless theres a good reason not to eg conflict of interest what is carry carry is a percentage of the profit of a fund if any in syndicates a special purpose fund is created for each syndicated deal if that deal returns a profit to the backers the lead receives a carry this is different from venture capital funds which make several investments out of a single fund in a vc fund the profitable investments must compensate for the unprofitable ones for the general partners to receive a carry the gps may also have to return a minimum profit to their limited partners for the gps receive carry—this is known as a hurdle rate since syndicate leads dont have to compensate for their unprofitable investments or return a minimum profit to receive carry they can charge a lower carry than traditional vc funds who can see a syndicated deal the syndicate lead can choose whether information about the deal will be made available to specific backers only to the general angellist investor community or with the company’s permission to the general public of even logged out angellist users and the press regardless of who sees it the lead along with the founders will ultimately pick which investors can participate leads how do i create a syndicate to create a syndicate click the syndicate tab youll need to fill in some basic information for backers including how many deals you expect to syndicate each year and your normal investment size to syndicate a deal hit the syndicate a deal button in the lower right of the manage syndicate page the minimum deal size your allocation in the round is k leads what am i committing to syndicate leads commit to providing a written investment thesis for each of their investments and disclosing potential conflicts of interest such as warrants advisory shares or an investment in a previous round they are also required to make a significant investment in each of their syndicated deals and to review and screen potential investors in each deal this document is authorized for use by neha budhraja from  to  in the course mgmt   venture capital and entrepreneurial management  han spring  university of pennsylvania any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited angellist changing the landscape of investing e p  leads will need to sign a side letter making them an advisor of our fund manager assure fund management and register as an exempt reporting advisor with finra leads are not required to syndicate every deal they invest in leads should be prepared to field inquiries from backers about their investments even though backers have limited information rights leads who can back my syndicate any accredited investor can apply to back a syndicate leads can then accept or reject them leads can also remove a backer at any time leads should consider accepting only experienced investors people they trust and people they want to work with experienced investors will be less likely to stop backing a syndicate or opt out of a specific deal inexperienced backers may also have unrealistic expectations about the returns they will realize on their investments leads what happens when the syndicates allocation is smaller than the total backing each backer will be reduced pro rata heres an example sara has a syndicate with  backers each of them back her for k for a total of k in backing she personally invests k in a startup and asks for an additional k for her backers however the startup is only able to allocate an additional k for her backers because her total backing is larger than the additional allocation each of her backers would invest k instead of their usual k if a backers reduced amount is less than the minimum investment for a deal the backer will invest the minimum investment if the reduced amounts still exceed the syndicates allocation the lead will exercise judgment to reduce backers investment amounts for that deal—the lead will likely favor backers who have expertise in the startups markets and have large backing amounts leads can my vc fund form a syndicate yes individuals and vc funds can both form syndicates if a fund has its own lps the lead should check if their lp agreement allows them to form a syndicate if it does any carry the lead collects from a syndicate can be distributed to the funds gps lps or split between them backers what am i committing to when i back someone backers agree to invest in their leads syndicated deals on the same terms as the lead they also pay the lead a carry backers can stop backing a syndicate at any time—of course all of the backers existing investments in the leads deals remain intact when they stop backing backers can also opt out of specific deals backers that consistently opt out of a syndicates deals may be removed by the lead this document is authorized for use by neha budhraja from  to  in the course mgmt   venture capital and entrepreneurial management  han spring  university of pennsylvania any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited angellist changing the landscape of investing e p  backers ive been accepted to a syndicate—whats next the next time your lead syndicates a deal backers will be notified and given the opportunity to opt out of converting their backing into a reservation the syndicate lead will also provide their investment rationale for the deal and disclose conflicts of interest later backers will go through a closing process and wire funds backers when do i get my profits when an exit opportunity arises the lead will advise the fund when to sell the syndicates shares if there are any profits they are then distributed to the syndicate for example if the company ipos the lead will decide when to sell the shares if the company is sold for cash the lead will distribute any profits to the syndicate there are many other situations that are not considered here—in any case the lead advises the fund when to sell the syndicate fund like all investors is bound by restrictions with the company and can only sell shares in certain situations backers what is transparency transparency allows syndicate leads to indicate whether they are syndicating all of their investments of k or more leads are not required to syndicate all of their investments and their transparency is not a legallybinding agreement they may also change their transparency setting at any point in time syndicates that are not sharing all of their investments may suffer from adverse selection ie leads may keep their best investments for themselves backers can i change my investment amount in a particular deal backers can increase or reduce their investment in a particular deal or opt out of a deal entirely the lead may also reduce a backers investment in a particular deal if the syndicates allocation is oversubscribed backers that consistently lower their investment amounts or frequently opt out of deals may be removed by the syndicate lead backers do i coinvest every time one of my leads invests in a company you coinvest only when a lead syndicates a deal—some leads dont syndicate all of their investments backers what information rights do i receive overall the information that backers receive will not be as detailed as direct investors on the other hand most companies will not accept small direct investments if a backer is interested in making a direct investment she should get an introduction to the startup an angellist entity or the lead will distribute the following documents to backers when they invest in a syndicated deal this document is authorized for use by neha budhraja from  to  in the course mgmt   venture capital and entrepreneurial management  han spring  university of pennsylvania any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited angellist changing the landscape of investing e p   documents related to the funds formation such as its operating agreement ppm and subscription agreement  terms of the investment as well as templates of the documents that the fund signs such as the underlying investment documents not including the companys schedule of investors  qualitative updates on the company status if available this is very highlevel information that is similar to what vcs provide to their lps for example it may include information about the companys status with customers or financing it will generally not include any figures  any information investors need for their taxes like ks is distributed annually backers whats a reservation reservations are nonbinding indications that an investor wants to invest in a company when one of your leads syndicates a deal your backing is converted into a reservation in the company when there are enough reservations investors will be invited to close although reservations are nonbinding commitments backers who regularly opt out of deals or do not follow through on their reservations may be removed from syndicates backers how is backing a syndicate different than investing in a vc fund backing a lead and investing in a vc fund are complementary—syndicates are not intended to replace vc funds however there are differences  backers get to pick a particular investor instead of an entire fund  backers do not have a year lockup on their funds  backers can stop backing at any time  leads typically personally invest more per deal than gps backers can investors outside the us back syndicates yes having a tax identification number tin is helpful but not required investors outside or inside the us should also get good tax advice when investing in startups startups can my company be syndicated your company must be a usbased c corporation preferably delaware california or ny and have a syndicate lead startups do i have to deal with a million new investors no the lead and backers invest in a fund which then invests in the startup only the fund is listed on the startups cap table—the individual investors in the fund are not the fund is advised by the lead who signs documents and makes decisions for the fund this document is authorized for use by neha budhraja from  to  in the course mgmt   venture capital and entrepreneurial management  han spring  university of pennsylvania any unauthorized use or reproduction of this document is strictly prohibited angellist changing the landscape of investing e p  the overhead is equivalent to adding a single large investor to the round startups do backers count towards my companys shareholder limit probably the lead and backers invest in a fund which then invests in the startup the fund only adds one new investor to the cap table but the fund will likely be interpreted as a passthrough entity for the purposes of counting shareholders fortunately the jobs act just lifted the shareholder limit for a company to stay private from  to  startups how do i communicate with investors in my syndicate you can communicate with investors in your syndicate once the deal is closed by clicking the for investors tab on your startup profile and posting an update you can add files traction information and rich text investors in your syndicate will receive a

it was  after which point the company had to register and report to the sec just like it was a public company even if it hadn’t gone public this was a major issue for many fast growing companies that either went through strange contortions not to have  investors or filed with the sec to get noaction letters there were plenty of nuances around this rule and i was in the middle of several situations that structured around it legally each time it was a lot of overhead for the company in question none of which added anything to the system except fees to the lawyers lifting the number of investors to  seemed to make sense in the situations i was involved in it would have immediately solved the specific problem so that’s good but ever since we started working with angellist on fg angels we’ve been wrestling with something called we’ve been referring to as the  investor problem we structure our investment in companies via an llc that has all the individual fg angels syndicate members in it this simplifies life for the company as they only end up with  investor – the fg angels syndicate lcc – rather than a bunch of individual investors at this point we have  backers in our syndicate so with us each company would end up having  separate investors if we didn’t use the llc if everyone was on the cap table the company would have to chase down  signatures for everything instead using our approach they have effectively two investors – our fg angels syndicate one investor and foundry group another investor two signatures much easier we handle the foundry group signature angellist handles the syndicate signature except it doesn’t work that way the sec limits an llc to having  investors so we can only have  of the  syndicate members participate now there’s a nuance that excludes “qualified purchasers” qps – individuals with m in assets and firms with m in assets – from the  investor count overall our qps  the top  investors in our syndicate represent  based on committed amounts to fg angels if you include the balance of the  members we end up at a syndicate of  the company then gets our commitment of  on top of that as a result of this  investor limitation we have two disappointing problems first we have over  investors who would like to invest in our syndicate with us who get excluded because of the  investor rule next there is  per investment that we’d like to include in each syndicate that the companies we are investing in won’t get bad for the companies and bad for the investor we’ve spent lots of time over the past  days trying to solve the  investor problem at this point we’ve run into a dead end we’ve tried multiple llcs – that doesn’t work as they end up getting viewed as a single entity we’ve tried other structures – that doesn’t work we’re certainly open to ideas at this point in the mean time until we solve this angellist is making the following changes to their syndicates product – qualified purchasers angellist will include all qualified purchasers individuals with m in assets and firms with m in assets in each syndicated deal as they are exempt from the sec’s investor limit we will soon email your backers to determine if they are qualified purchasers qps and we will update your syndicate management interface to indicate the qps – top  backers the next time you syndicate a deal we will include all qps and the top  nonqps by commitment amount you can override this default to include specific backers who are not in the top  the top  backers will change dynamically as backers adjust their backing amounts – funds we are working on new funds products to allow additional investors who are not in your top  backers or qps to participate in your syndicated deals – notifying backers finally we will notify your backers of the sec’s investor restriction this week and give them the opportunity to change their backing amounts we are bummed about this because part of our goal is to build a very large angel network as a result of the fg angels activity the  investor rule directly undermines this and limits the amount of investment and support for the companies we are investing in it’s another example of the challenges of the jobs act and another discovery on our part of the “miss” between the goal of the new law and the implementation sponsored links by dq promote you may also likefoundrygroup’s
