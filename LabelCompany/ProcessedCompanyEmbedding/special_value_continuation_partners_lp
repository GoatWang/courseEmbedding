plaintiffs v geoff a jones et al defendants united states bankruptcy court sd texas houston division november   memorandum opinion marvin isgur bankruptcy judge introduction this memorandum opinion concerns whether the court should transfer this related to proceeding to delaware federal court or whether the court should abstain and remand the case to the texas state court from which it was removed the court holds that transfer is unwarranted under both  usc §  and §  the court will abstain under § c and remand the case to texas state court under § b factual background plaintiffs special value continuation partners lp tennenbaum dip opportunity fund llc and tennenbaum opportunities partners v lp collectively tennenbaum filed a state court lawsuit in texas alleging that richard bachmann geoff a jones d michael wallace rishi varma brett cenkus stephen morrell and gerald gray collectively defendants provided misleading financial projections and made misrepresentations in order to secure financing from tennenbaum for the defendants companies ecf doc  at  the defendants were officers and directors of trico marine services inc and its us affiliates holdco and trico shipping as a foreign operating subsidiary of holdco and its affiliates opco id opco and holdco collectively are referred to as trico id trico sought financing from tennenbaum tennenbaums allegations stem from the may june and july  negotiations surrounding the financing originally tennenbaum was only to loan to holdco as the negotiations progressed trico indicated it wanted new financing for opco as well ecf doc  at  the financing for holdco was to occur in two stages  million prior to filing bankruptcy and  million after holdco filed for bankruptcy collectively the holdco loans ecf doc  at  the initial loan to holdco was funded on june   ecf doc  at  on june   tennenbaum agreed to fund opco up to  million ecf doc  at  the loans were secured by opcos assets id on august   as planned the holdco bankruptcies were filed in the month prior to bankruptcy and in the months directly following tennenbaum alleges trico drastically revised the financial projections upon which tennenbaum relied ecf doc  at  eventually tennenbaum suspected it had been defrauded tennenbaum filed suit in a california state court on march   for fraud and negligent misrepresentation ecf doc  at  tennenbaum is only seeking damages relating to the opco loan ecf doc  at  defendants removed the california state court lawsuit to the united states district court for the central district of california id tennenbaum filed this nearly identical action on may   in harris county texas id and voluntarily dismissed the california suit on may   id at  defendants again removed to federal court on june   ecf doc  tennenbaum filed a motion to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction motion to abstain pursuant to §  and motion to remand on other equitable grounds under §  ecf doc  defendants filed a motion to transfer under §  and §  analysis which to decide first tennenbaum argues abstention and remand should be decided prior to transfer ecf doc  at  defendants argue the opposite ecf doc  at  both sides cite cases in support the court finds that it should first decide the motion to transfer most of the cases cited by tennenbaum are distinguishable as they fit into one of two fact patterns transfer might not be considered first if a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction see eg in re santa clara county child care consortium  br  st cir bap  or if mandatory abstention applies see eg in re engra inc  br   sd tex  neither situation is applicable the court has subject matter jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding only because it is related to a case under title   usc § b in the fifth circuit related to jurisdiction is established when the outcome of the proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy wood v wood in re wood  fd   th cir  defendants who are principals of holdco filed a proof of claim in the holdco bankruptcy seeking contribution reimbursement and indemnity for the costs of defending this action ecf doc  at  holdcos liability policies an estate asset may be used to satisfy the claims of various creditors—including defendants if they are found liable ecf doc  at  the outcome of this action could conceivably affect the bankruptcy estate this establishes related to jurisdiction mandatory abstention does not apply the mandatory abstention provision requires among other things that the district court shall abstain from hearing such proceeding if an action is commenced  in a state forum of appropriate jurisdiction  usc § c the court agrees with those cases interpreting this language to require a state court action be commenced prior to the bankruptcy proceedings see generally  collier on bankruptcy ¶  n listing other cases so holding and noting a change in statutory language which supports the holding as there is subject matter jurisdiction and mandatory abstention is inapplicable the court will decide the motion to transfer first if transfer is appropriate under either §  or §  then the transferee court should decide whether to abstain and remand transfer under  usc §  this court has held §  is limited to the transfer of core matters see longhorn partners pipeline lp v km liquids terminals llc  br   bankr sd tex  the court finds this is not a core proceeding and therefore §  transfer is inapplicable in the fifth circuit a core proceeding is one that invokes a substantive right provided by title  or  is a proceeding that by its nature could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case wood v wood in re wood  fd   th cir  this state court lawsuit for fraud and negligent misrepresentation is not invoking a substantive right provided by title  nor could it only arise in the context of a bankruptcy defendants argue the adversary proceeding is nevertheless core because  tennenbaum invoked and consented to the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction over the working capital facility  the present litigation will require interpretation and enforcement of the delaware bankruptcy courts orders and  because tennenbaum filed a proof of claim in the delaware bankruptcy proceedings ecf doc  at  these arguments are not persuasive defendants first argument fails defendants argue it is possible to consent to have a bankruptcy court treat an otherwise noncore proceeding as core ecf doc  at  to show tennenbaums alleged consent defendants point out that the delaware bankruptcy court approved a settlement between holdco the debtors opco nondebtors and creditors including tennenbaum in which the stock of a restructured opco was made available for creditors owed money under the working capital facility ecf doc  at  the delaware bankruptcy court approved this debtforequity exchange in which tennenbaum received stock and cash worth  million ecf doc  at  in the order approving the settlement there is a provision that this court retains jurisdiction with respect to all matters arising from or related to the implementation of this order delaware bankruptcy court doc  at  defendants argument appears to be that any attempts to recover under the working capital facility now become core proceedings in the delaware bankruptcy court—and that tennenbaum consented to this this argument appears incorrect for at least three reasons the first is that this state court lawsuit is not an attempt to recover under the working capital facility tennenbaum is not suing opco for a deficiency or holdco as guarantor of the loans tennenbaum is suing the principals of opco and holdco for fraud and negligent misrepresentation—not breach of contract or any other theory which could be deemed an attempt to recover under the working capital facility ecf doc  at  second the delaware bankruptcy court retained exclusive jurisdiction only with respect to all matter arising from or related to the implementation of this order delaware bankruptcy court doc  at  defendants have not shown that this state court lawsuit arises from or relates to the implementation of the order third the court does not accept that a retention of jurisdiction provision can alter the nature of a bankruptcy courts authority over a matter a bankruptcy courts determination of its authority is akin to a question of subject matter jurisdiction comm futures trading v schor  us    it is fundamental that a courts subject matter jurisdiction cannot be created by an expansive bankruptcy court order united states brass corp v travelers ins group  fd   th cir  the source of the bankruptcy courts subject matter jurisdiction is neither the bankruptcy code nor the express terms of the plan the source of the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction is  usc §§  and   defendants second argument fails because defendants do not show how interpretation and enforcement of the delaware bankruptcy courts orders will be necessary to adjudicate the state court causes of action it might be necessary for a state court to determine the value received by tennenbaum in the opco restructuring in order to properly calculate damages nevertheless the interpretation and enforcement of the delaware bankruptcy courts orders is not necessary for valuation defendants third argument also fails the delaware bankruptcy court has core jurisdiction over the claims allowance process  usc § bb tennenbaum filed a proof of claim against holdco debtors in the delaware bankruptcy action because holdco guaranteed the opco loan ecf doc  at  this fact does not make a state court fraud action against holdcos principals a core proceeding in the holdco bankruptcy even one relating to negotiations surrounding the opco loan for which holdco acted as guarantor in the alternative defendants ask the court to  refrain from engaging in a core versus noncore determination as this defeats the policy behind the presumption that the home court bankruptcy is the most appropriate forum to make the decision of whether to abstain and remand and  reconsider its holding that §  does not apply to related to noncore proceedings ecf doc  at  neither of these additional arguments is persuasive assuming arguendo the home court bankruptcy rule still exists under §  this court still cannot avoid making a core versus noncore determination as explained above §  may not be used to transfer related to noncore proceedings the core versus noncore determination is unavoidable for §  transfer notwithstanding defendants contention that this defeats the policy behind the home bankruptcy court presumption the court does not find defendants §  textual argument persuasive and reaffirms the ruling in longhorn partners defendants argue that § s use of the word proceeding should inform a courts interpretation of §  ecf doc  at  defendants point out that proceeding in §  is followed by the phrase arising under title  or arising in or related to a case under title  thereby encompassing related to noncore proceedings id therefore defendants argue the word proceeding in §  must necessarily be afforded the same breadth id this argument overlooks the fact that in §  the word proceeding is followed simply by the phrase under title  as opposed to arising under title  or arising in or related to a case under title  the phrase under title  modifies and limits which proceedings are transferable under §  the court reaffirms the holding in longhorn partners that §  may be not be used to transfer related to proceedings transfer under  usc §  a threshold question for §  transfer is whether a civil action might have been brought in the venue to which transfer is requested  usc § a the parties disagree whether the civil action could have been filed in the delaware bankruptcy court even assuming that the civil action might have been brought in delaware the court finds §  transfer otherwise inappropriate defendants have not met their burden of proof for §  transfer defendants as the movants must demonstrate that the transferee venue is clearly more convenient in re volkswagen of am inc  fd   th cir  a court may transfer any civil action for the convenience of parties and witnesses in the interest of justice  usc §  courts consider private and public interest factors when determining whether transferring venue is for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice humble oil  ref co v bell marine serv  fd   th cir  the private interest factors are  the relative ease and access to sources of proof  the availability of compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses  the cost of attendance for willing witnesses and  all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy expeditious and inexpensive in re volkswagen of am inc  fd   th cir  the public interest factors are  the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion  the local interest in have localized interests decided at home  the familiarity of the forum with the law that will govern the case and  the avoidance of unnecessary problems of conflict of laws or in the application of foreign law id no single factor is dispositive and the above list is neither exhaustive nor exclusive id private interest factors relative ease of access to sources of proof weighs slightly in favor of transfer the court agrees with defendants that in a case where there is no physical nondocumentary evidence the location of physical evidence is of little consequence as to key party witnesses on the whole they are located closer to texas than delaware most defendants are texas residents ecf doc  at  the tennenbaum entities have their headquarters in santa monica california which is closer to texas than delaware ecf doc  at  yet the court agrees with defendants that it is the location and availability of key thirdparty witnesses that should be given the most weight see mohamed v mazda motor corp  fsuppd  ed tex  defendants identify thirdparty witnesses for whom they argue delaware would be more convenient than texas ecf doc  at  defendants argue the delaware venue will increase the availability of these key thirdparty witnesses who will provide relevant testimony ecf doc  at  tennenbaum did not produce similar evidence to rebut this therefore this factor slightly favors transfer availability of compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses is a neutral factor neither party showed why this factor weighs in favor of or against transfer ecf doc  at  ecf doc  at  cost of attendance for willing witnesses also weighs slightly in favor of transfer for the same reasons listed above texas is more convenient for party witnesses again however as to key nonparty witnesses the only evidence before the court is that delaware will be less costly and more convenient for key nonparty witnesses who are likely to testify ecf doc  at  the final private interest factor all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy expeditious and inexpensive does not favor transfer even if defendants are correct that under other circumstances it should be presumed that a related to proceeding can be more easily expeditiously and inexpensively tried in front of the home bankruptcy court the recent supreme court decision in stern v marshall negates this  sct  june   although the extent of sterns reach is unclear there is little question a bankruptcy judge lacks constitutional authority to enter a final judgment in this case these are state law causes of action by nondebtors against nondebtors the causes of action neither derive from nor depend upon any agency regulatory scheme stern  sct at  additionally the causes of action do not stem from the holdco bankruptcy proceedings nor will the causes of action necessarily be resolved by the claims allowance process in those bankruptcies stern  sct at  entering a final judgment in this case would be the prototypical exercise of judicial power and an article i judge lacks the constitutional authority to do so id as a result defendants argument that it will be easier more expeditious and less expensive to try this case in delaware is unconvincing defendants statement that the delaware bankruptcy court is familiar with the transactional history and complex corporate structures of trico is undoubtedly true ecf doc  at  yet the delaware bankruptcy court would only be able to write a report and recommendation the report and recommendation will be subject to de novo review by the delaware district court which lacks the delaware bankruptcy courts experience knowledge and familiarity with the case therefore this factor does not favor transfer public interest factors the administrative difficulties from court congestion do not favor transfer defendants presented some limited evidence showing bankruptcy courts in the southern district of texas are more congested than those in delaware ecf doc  at  the evidence however is for the year ending in march  and appears to provide only the number of bankruptcy filings without regard to chapter or the number of accompanying adversary proceedings id defendants evidence is not persuasive this courts docket is not overwhelming moreover the real question that must be confronted is the caseload of the delaware united states district court vs the harris county district court there is an absence of evidence on this issue this factor does not favor transfer the local interest in having localized interests decided at home weighs against transfer most of the defendants are texas residents ecf doc  at  many of the alleged fraudulent actions and negligent misrepresentations took place in texas ecf doc  at  the court agrees with tennenbaum that it cannot be seriously disputed that the state of texas has a strong interest in having state law claims asserted against her citizens adjudicated in a texas court ecf doc  at  defendants argument that delaware has an equivalent local interest because the tennenbaum entities although headquartered in california are incorporated in delaware is unconvincing familiarity of the forum with the law that will govern the case is neutral or weighs against transfer tennenbaum argues that texas law governs this case ecf doc  at  defendants argue that new york law controls ecf doc  at  if tennenbaum is correct this would weigh against transfer because a texas state court will be more familiar with the application of texas law even if new york law does control defendants provide no explanation why this favors transfers to the delaware bankruptcy court both parties agree the final factor avoiding conflict of laws is neutral defendants argue that judicial economy is an additional factor to be considered in a decision to transfer part of the argument rehashes the efficiency analysis related to the fourth of the private interest factors ecf doc  at  the court rejects this argument for the same reasons as stated above defendants other main contention is that because the delaware bankruptcy court cannot resolve defendants proof of claim for indemnity until this case is resolved judicial economy weighs in favor of transfer because it is more efficient for judge shannon to rule on both tennenbaums fraud allegations and defendants proofs of claim ecf doc  at  this argument suffers from the same defect as the other efficiency arguments—judge shannon will not be able to enter a final judgment defendants also argue that judge shannon is in a better position than this court to weigh all equitable factors in a decision whether to abstain and remand ecf doc  at  accepting arguendo this is true defendants fail to show how this aids overall judicial economy judge shannon remains without constitutional authority to enter a final judgment relating to the substantive allegations to the extent judicial economy is a separate factor not sufficiently encompassed by the other eight factors the court finds judicial economy does not favor transfer all §  factors combined the factors of convenience to witnesses and access to sources of proof are the only two which weigh in favor of transfer—and even then only slightly all other factors are either neutral or weigh against transfer defendants have not shown the transferee court to be clearly more convenient discretionary abstention and remand this court may in its discretion decline from hearing this proceeding similarly this court may choose to remand a cause of action on any equitable ground courts will consider a number of specific factors in deciding whether to abstain or remand see sabre tech v tsm skyline exhibits inc  wl  sd tex sept   these include  the effect or lack thereof on the efficient administration of the estate if the court recommends remand or abstention  extent to which state law issues predominate over bankruptcy issues  difficult or unsettled nature of applicable law  presence of related proceeding commenced in state court or other nonbankruptcy proceeding  jurisdictional basis if any other than §   degree of relatedness or remoteness of proceeding to main bankruptcy case  the substance rather than the form of an asserted core proceeding  the feasibility of severing state law claims from core bankruptcy matters to allow judgment to be entered in state court with enforcement left to the bankruptcy court  the burden of the bankruptcy courts docket  the likelihood that the commencement of the proceeding in bankruptcy court involves forum shopping by one of the parties  the existence of a right to a jury trial  the presence in the proceeding of nondebtors parties  comity  possibility of prejudice to other parties in the action id at  n courts have broad discretion when considering abstention or remand under these provisions id at  defendants argue the balance should be weighted heavily in favor of the exercise of federal jurisdiction ecf doc  at  the cases defendants cited in support however discuss colorado river abstention they do not support the claim that the balance should be weighted heavily in favor of federal jurisdiction when considering discretionary abstention section c is a broadlyworded statute allowing federal courts to decline to exercise jurisdiction in the interest of justice or in the interest of comity with state courts or respect for state law  usc §  in fact the fifth circuit noted that the discretionary abstention provision of § c helps prevent the broad language of § b from bringing into federal court matters which should be left to state courts to decide see wood v wood in re wood  fd   th cir  when considering whether to abstain or remand under § c the balance should not be weighted in favor of exercising federal jurisdiction factors favoring discretionary abstention and remand factors        and  all weigh in favor of abstention and remand factor  estate administration supports abstention and remand if not having a case before the home bankruptcy court will negatively effect the administration of the estate then this factor should weigh against abstention and remand here however the court already ruled against defendants motion to transfer to the home bankruptcy court furthermore the holding of stern v marshall indicates that even if this case were before the delaware bankruptcy court the judge is without constitutional authority to enter a final judgment therefore any detrimental effect to the efficient administration of the estate cannot be said to result from a decision to abstain and remand this courts decision to abstain and remand will not have any negative effect on the efficient administration of the estate which would not already occur factor  state law issues strongly supports abstention and remand because whether new york or texas law applies these are solely state causes of action factor  jurisdictional basis weighs in favor of abstention and remand because there is neither diversity nor federal question jurisdiction federal jurisdiction is based solely on §  factor  substance and classification strongly supports abstention and remand because this is not a core proceeding in addition the court finds the substance of the proceeding is not of the type for which resolution by a bankruptcy court rather than a state court should be favored cf sabre tech  wl  at  citing sears petroleum  transp corp v burgess contr servs inc  fsuppd   d mass  noting the importance of having the bankruptcy court adjudicate fraudulent conveyance claims factor  feasibility of severance supports abstention and remand the court finds it would not be problematic to sever this lawsuit from the core bankruptcy proceedings this lawsuit is between nondebtors is based entirely on state law causes of action and is based on events occurring prior to the bankruptcy proceedings factor  forum shopping weighs in favor of abstention and remand because the court does not find the defendants allegation of forum shopping convincing it is true that tennenbaum dismissed the california proceeding after removal to federal court and later refiled in texas state court defendants allege that tennenbaums choice of forum is so plainly forum shopping and argue that tennenbaum will have a full and fair opportunity to present and litigate their claims in the federal forum ecf doc  at  emphasis in original the latter statement is correct but defendants do not explain how it is evidence the former statement is true defendants provide no additional evidence or reasoning to justify its claim of forum shopping the court notes the seemingly unusual situation of texas residents complaining the other party is forum shopping after being sued in texas state court for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentations that allegedly occurred in texas moreover the court notes that companies headquartered in texas chose to file bankruptcy in delaware its principals now seek to bootstrap that decision into a tort adjudication in delaware the court concludes that the forum shopping shoe is most likely on the other foot the right to a jury trial supports abstention and remand the parties disagree whether tennenbaum waived the right to a jury trial defendants argue that tennenbaum waived its right to a jury trial because of a provision contained in tennenbaums agreement with opco ecf doc  at  tennenbaum argues the waiver provision only applies to a suit against opco for breach of contract not a suit against defendants for fraud and negligent misrepresentations which induced tennenbaum to enter into the agreement ecf doc  at  the issue of waiver of the jury trial is an issue under state law and therefore to the extent that the issue is unsettled it favors remand finally factor  comity weighs in favor of abstention and remand because these are solely state law causes of action between nondebtors and there is no sufficiently countervailing federal interest cf see sabre tech  wl  at  finding this factor neutral where the causes of action while solely based on state law included claims for the determination and recovery of fraudulent conveyances factors weighing against discretionary abstention and remand factors  and  weigh against abstention and remand factor  difficulty or unsettled nature of the law weighs against abstention and remand because as tennenbaum admits fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims are wellsettled in texas law ecf doc  at  defendants argue that new york law applies but agree that either way this case does not present new or unsettled questions of state law ecf doc  at  factor  timeliness weighs against abstention and remand because this cause of action although initially filed in state court was promptly removed see sabre tech  wl  at  finding this factor weighed against abstention and remand where a related state court proceeding was promptly removed prior to the expense of significant resources neutral factors factors    and  are neutral factor  degree of relatedness is a neutral factor although this adversary proceeding is related to the bankruptcy case its outcome is not dispositive of any issue in the main bankruptcy case moreover the degree of relatedness or remoteness of a proceeding to the main bankruptcy case can neither weigh in favor of nor against abstention and remand when the proceeding will not be heard before the bankruptcy judge who heard the main bankruptcy case factor  docket congestion is a neutral factor as stated above this courts docket is not overwhelming at the same time it is not so light as to weigh against abstention and remand moreover there is no evidence comparing this courts docket with the harris county courts docket factor  presence of nondebtor parties is a neutral factor because while the parties to this lawsuit are all nondebtors the defendants are principals of the debtors in the delaware bankruptcy proceedings see sabre tech  wl  at  finding this factor neutral under similar circumstances factor  prejudicial effect is a neutral factor because neither side has sufficiently demonstrated it would suffer prejudice if the court rules against or in favor of abstention and remand all discretionary abstention and remand factors combined only two factors weigh against abstention and remand eight factors weigh in favor of abstention and remand and the remaining four are neutral more importantly than the numerical count the court finds that the arguments in favor of abstention and remand are of greater importance and persuasion than those that counsel against remand therefore the court abstains under § c and remands under § b conclusion the court will issue a separate order in accordance with this memorandum opinion footnotes  defendants refer to this loan as the us credit facility ecf doc  at   defendants refer to this loan as the dip facility ecf doc  at   defendants refer to these loans collectively as the trico loans ecf doc  at   defendants refer to this agreement as the working capital facility ecf doc  at  tennenbaum did not end up loaning all  million opco borrowed  million before tennenbaum terminated the loan commitments and tennenbaum alleges that  million remains outstanding ecf doc  at   opco never filed bankruptcy  defendants also argue that the firsttofile rule compels transfer ecf doc  at  the fifth circuit described this rule as follows a byproduct of the wellestablished axiom that the federal courts long have recognized that the principle of comity requires federal district courts—courts of coordinate jurisdiction and equal rank—to exercise care to avoid interference with each others affairs    the concern manifestly is to avoid the waste of duplication to avoid rulings which may trench upon the authority of sister courts and to avoid piecemeal resolution of issues that call for a uniform result sutter corp v p  p indus  fd  th cir  citing west gulf maritime assn v ila deep sea local   fd   th cir  therefore if the cases overlap on the substantive issues they should be consolidated in the jurisdiction first seized of the issues id the overlap needs to be substantial however save power v syntek fin corp  fd  th cir  the court agrees with plaintiffs that typically the firsttofile rule involves opposing parties in mirror litigation furthermore these state law causes of action and the delaware bankruptcy proceeding do not substantially overlap on substantive issues much less are they inextricably intertwined as defendants claim ecf doc  at  there are certainly overlapping facts between the cases most of defendants argument regarding overlapping issues relates to factual overlap—not overlap of the substantive issues ie fraud and negligent misrepresentation the substantive issues of fraud and negligent misrepresentations by nondebtors do not substantially overlap with the substantive issues of the delaware bankruptcy court proceedings and certainly will not result in duplication of efforts a ruling which will entrench upon the authority of a sister court or piecemeal resolution of the issues  again working capital facility refers to the  million funding agreement between tennenbaum and opco ecf doc  at   holdco guaranteed the working capital facility and therefore liable for any deficiency related to the opco loan ecf doc  at   it is possible that the fifth circuits volkswagen opinion alters or negates such a presumption see in re volkswagen of america inc  fd  th cir   except as otherwise provided in subsections b and d a proceeding arising under title  or arising in or related to a case under title  may be commenced in the district court in which such case is pending  usc § a defendants also point to the title of the section venue of proceedings arising under title  or arising in or related to cases under title   usc §   defendants actually state the word proceeding modifies all of the phrase arising under title  or arising in or related to a case under title   ecf doc  at  it appears to the court that it is the latter phrase which modifies the word proceeding not the reverse in any event the gist of defendants argument remains the same— the word proceeding should be afforded the same breadth in §  as in §   a district court may transfer a case or proceeding under title  to a district court for another district in the interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties  usc §   the court notes although this argument was not briefed that the longhorn partners holding overlooks one issue section  only allows transfer of a case or proceeding under title   usc §  in longhorn partners the court stated that section s application is limited to core matters this would indicate that all core matters may be transferred under §  core matters consist of both proceedings arising under title  and proceedings arising in a case under title  the court recognizes that based on the text of §  it would not make sense to allow transfer of proceedings arising in a case under title  but disallow transfer of proceedings related to a case under title  the holding in longhorn partners should have stated that §  transfer is only applicable to core proceedings arising under title  this difference should have little practical effect as the court can think of few proceedings arising in a case under title  that would arise in any venue other than the home bankruptcy court  it is arguable that the fifth circuits  volkzwagen opinion dealing with inappropriate weight given to plaintiffs choice of venue under §  eliminates such a presumption see in re volkswagen of america inc  fd  th cir   except with respect to a case under chapter  of title
