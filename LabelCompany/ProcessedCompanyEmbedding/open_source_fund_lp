release fund  comments with outstanding performance results on the ceb press we are getting ever closer to the planned product release date of april   we are employing a product release fund as part of our open source product release strategy with the primary aim of addressing the freeloader dilemma in funding this open source project while progress on crowd support funding has been quite satisfactory it is nowhere near the level where we can afford rapid project acceleration towards the full global village construction set gvcs the point is – we believe that deploying the gvcs will benefit the world immensely – many times over what people are contributing thus fundraising the miniscule quantities about  million for the entire gvcs that we believe will change the world profoundly – should be no problem this is not so in practice the product release fund encourages people to donate this fund is aimed primarily at those who are interested in building the ceb machine themselves or who are interested in fabrication as a small enterprise the fund works as follows anyone who donates  or more to the project or provides an equivalent inkind donation receives technical and fabrication drawings as soon as these are complete we will be completing these drawings after we build our second and third prototypes – at which time the designs have been refined and tested thoroughly we will be releasing these componentbycomponent for example as soon as the frame or hopper designs are perfected drawings for these components are made available these will be explicit milestones achieved in the project people have until the product release date of april   to donate anyone who misses this deadline will have to wait until the product release fund prf is satisfied the prf quota is set at k for the the liberator high performance ceb press full technical drawings are released into the public domain as soon as the quota is reached we are allowing  year for this quota to be reached at which time we release the complete plans even if the quota is not reached the above encourages anyone who is really interested in a lowcost liberator to contribute prior to product release – which is the time when support is needed the most  is peanuts for someone to pay when materials cost k and the next cheapest competition costs k our quota is less than the price of one ceb machine from any of the cometitors the freeloader dilemma is only partially solved with this concept though most people will not be producers of the machine – most will buy it from someone else production will happen whether they contribute or not – though it may take longer for us to get there we are looking for comments and suggestions on this concept we are on the untested frontiers of open product development – so your suggestions are welcome if we can demonstrate that the rewards are worthy – how do we motivate people to contribute is it simply about a larger marketing effort tagged as freeloader dilemma  open source product development  product release fund  comments lucas november   at  am  reply as we’ve talked over through email i intend to translate the brochure into spanish if and when i do i’ll also sendpublish a small howto so others may do the same for other languages this should broaden the contributor base and maybe even atract folks who’d participate in the technology andor the wiki regarding contributions we need to make this atractive for universities and builders anyone has contacts how could they the people in universities and industry benefit maybe “close enough” industry as in people who make elements for the designs that could move towards pieces for diy sellers of components such as electric motors etc mark november   at  pm  reply if i donate  will i have to sign a nondisclosure agreement not to divulge the design before the prf quota is reached what restrictions will you attach to my use of the design–can i for example build a the liberator for sale to third parties before the design is released i’m not sure it makes sense to talk about a “free rider problem” in connection with open source what you are describing sounds more like a closed design during the development phase with partial rights granted to investors this will prevent other parties from cooperating on the development until you have finished your third prototype this is your prerogative–you will still be doing a great service by releasing the designs at a late stage–but you would seem to miss out on any advantages of collaboration during design and testing for example thanks to your influence i am now tinkering with the idea of helping a newly unemployed friend set up a weldingmachine shop so he can help create equipment for me to use on my farm we might like to begin working on an xyz table but the release schedule in this post implies that the earliest we could collaborate with you remotely would be in a year or so and after your third prototype hope this criticism is constructive because i am enjoying watching your progress marcin november   at  am  reply mark these are good comments regarding your  paragraphs here are comments  there is no policing we donâ€™t have any energy for overhead and policing functions donors gain access with no restrictions you can produce it – we believe in free enterprise – no monpolies the process is intended to be essentially nonmonopolistic we do not have fear of the competitiion – if someone else offers a great product – we encourage that if someone else is offering compromises weâ€™ll still be in production and beat them out of business one part of this is that as suggested in the gvcs presentation at httpopenfarmtechorgindexphptitleumpresentation is that we are forced to diversify diversification is part of our essential strategy – we want to create thousands of diversified fabrication and agroecology producers – as a route to a better future any further suggestions perhaps to avoid this prf overhead we could set up a  true fans mechanism httpwwwkkorgthetechniumarchivestruefansphp  where people commit to  per month donation with  per month we could quadruple our productivity – and then watching progress at factor e farm would really be fun as weâ€™re creating a postscarcity global village right before peoplesâ€™ eyes  you make a good point on missing out collaboration opportunities also the fact of the matter at present is that nobody else is making any real physical developments on the open source ceb that i know of there are many people who ask me for the design and we donâ€™t have any tested design right now weâ€™re going through field testing before we put energy into making technical drawings of designs that work the design is not closed at present anyone interested in collaboration is invited and weâ€™ll share what we know freely when people want to help all that we know about the design at present has been documented in simple drawings fabrication pictures and video short of someone being here there is nothing more that we have to offer i am looking for suggestions of how to increase involvement of others it just seems that there are so few people who actually want to get their hands dirty in advanced ceb press development goes back to the freerider issue where people take my time but contribute to no real progress on the actual machine  release schedule httpopenfarmtechorgweblogwpcontentuploadsaugmentedprogramjpg shows xyz table fabrication beginning dec   so letâ€™s work together the other point is our program is not a spectator sport the gvcs development is the overall program – and if any additional resources appear at any time we parallel our development for example nick is coming here in december and we plan on doing metal casting and building the first steam engine by january progress is nonlinear – when resources appear other projects get done indeed we are planning the first world conference on open source ecology for summer  – which is a working conference where invited participants actually build parts of the gvcs itâ€™s a crash program for gvcs deployment – more info on this is forthcoming by end of this month lucas november   at  am  reply tongue in cheek you could sell bricks seriously your existing new website httpwwwfactorefarmorg could possibly host the  true fans place maybe people would subscribe to news not via a newsfeed aggregator or coming to check the blog but via a newsletter that would simply include monthly news and be issued close to pay day monetary contribution has to be made convenient not just desirable we still need to look for larger donors if possible teaching people to build machines will provide well earned money but the problem with funding exists not not so much in summer  lucas november   at  pm  reply sorry i meant it exists “now” not “not” geoff november   at  pm  reply “all that we know about the design at present has been documented in simple drawings fabrication pictures and video short of someone being here there is nothing more that we have to offer” from a personal perspective herein lies part of the problem with getting others to have a go and share ideas if i was to start work today on a ceb press i’d basically be starting from the same point you started from and besides the notes and ideas would have to figure a lot of the details out a good start would be a series of pictures showing all the pertinent details of the device from all angles so at least we could reverse engineer anyhow i’m willing to put up some money toward this goal have you got a link to provide it handy one which means we get on this prf list on the issue of throughput have you considered a much larger hopper that you can dump a bucket load or three of earth into with a coarse mesh seive at the bottom and the rotary hoe component under that attached to the device feeding into the original hopper richard november   at  pm  reply httpopenfarmtechorgindexphptitlemainpageoseproductcycle at this anchor are some links to basic design drawings and descriptions of the fabrication process they need more help putting together the designs as they do not have so much time given the work they do we are currently trying to develop greater living capacity so that a larger community of collaborators can work there and make these designs more detailed richard november   at  pm  reply or httpopenfarmtechorgindexphptitlecebpressstepdesignandfabrication rather sorry andrius kulikauskas november   at  pm  reply marcinbrittany and all hi from bosnia i just want to add my encouragement i’m thinking that for our minciu sodas activities in communia httpwwwcommuniaprojecteu and our travel funds for the workshops there we could advance support for open source hardware please let me know how that might be useful if you have thoughts thanks andrius marcin november   at  pm  reply we are currently formulating a  true fans –  global villages initiative – in which we gather support for rapid deployment of the entire global village construction set technology base httpfactorefarmorgviewprojectsall we’ll be publishing information about this soon tom l november   at  pm  reply how do i contribute money to the product release fund geoff said “anyhow iâ€™m willing to put up some money toward this goal have you got a link to provide it handy one which means we get on this prf list” the links provided so far are for product cycle and design and fabrication – how do i send you money for the prf so i can get on the prf list what about transparency – where exactly is the prf money going — anyone who donates in general to the ceb project is put on the prf list the construction is part of the ceb project – our digital fabrication facility for producing ceb machines regarding transparency – the only guidelines we have is that all of the money goes towards accelerating global village construction set deployment you can see what we accomplish by following our blog or subscribing to project news at httpfactorefarmorgviewprojectsall  allocation depends on priorities which are outlined in our proposal from last year – httpopenfarmtechorgoseproposaldoc  we will be updating the proposal within the next two months based on the learnings from  – marcin leave a comment cancel comment your email address

group aims to provide funds to these projects to allow lead developers to work fulltime on the project cii support will also be used to pay for security audits hardware and software infrastructure travel and other needs while the cii will provide the funding individual projects will continue to operate under the community norms that have made open source so successful the cii hasnt committed to any specific projects yet but not surprisingly openssl will be the first project considered for funding despite any official announcement of support it would be shocking if openssl wasnt funded since the heartbleed bug is what prompted the cii in the first place   the linux foundation will administer the funds for the cii in cooperation with a steering committee that includes backers of the cii as well as key open source developers and other industry stakeholders the linux foundation didnt say how much money was involved in the cii but a report from ars technica says the group has committed to at least a threeyear initiative and  million in funding that works out to about  per year from each company—a funding level that isnt even a rounding error for most of these corporations but a massive infusion for opensource projects hopefully the cii will prove its value over the next three years and convince the member companies to commit to the initiative for the long term as well as convince other companies to join the cause to comment on this article and other pcworld content visit our facebook page or our twitter feed related security software open source google microsoft amazoncom

register now pantera capital to raise  million in investment for ico hedge fund jun   at  utc by pete rizzo markets  •  news  •  other public protocols  •  business news  •  markets news  •  startups the m market for initial coin offerings may soon be set to expand announced today investment firm pantera capital is launching a new hedge fund focused on investments solely in tokens that power public blockchain protocols called pantera ico fund lp the fund intends to raise m with m already raised in support from the firms existing investor base undisclosed new investors and according to the company unnamed venture capital firms the new fund will complement pantera bitcoin partners a joint investment fund launched by pantera fortress benchmark capital and ribbit capital in early  to invest in the cryptocurrency in interview panteras leadership team framed the fund as an extension of its past investments which have included traditional investments in startups that have sought to incentivize distributed networks through the use of tokens included in the pantera portfolio are ripple and the zcash electric coin company which use the xrp and zec tokens respectively pantera ceo dan morehead and augur cofounder joey krug will serve as chief investment officers for the fund with the move krug is also joining pantera fulltime the fund is currently open only to us institutions and individuals though it intends to eventually open up support to nonus participants as explained by paul veradittakit venture investor at pantera capital the fund creation was sparked by the recent rapid uptick in interest in tokens and protocols according to coindesk data funding for icos has already surpassed traditional venture capital banking in  the mechanism has gone so far as to attract mainstream brands with messenger service kik announcing it would soon test a network token six months ago icos were a few million dollars morehead told coindesk even ethereums crowdsale was only m i think with kik were at a watershed moment a company with millions of active users is transitioning to open source however panteras investment strategy will be more nuanced than simply working with major brands that may be interested in the concept according to krug the fund will primarily seek to fund new protocols ones which they believe will use cryptographically unique data in a way thats integral to their operations if you look at the tokens they fall into two categories rentseeking tokens where you can remove the token and the network will be better off and nonrent seeking tokens where you remove the token and it doesnt work he said adding the latter have the strongest chance of generating longer value market strategy in interview pantera further opened up about how it would seek to inject its capital in the market comments that shed light on how its movements could impact the daytoday holdings of retail investors who may also be seeking exposure to crypto assets in this way morehead said that the market shouldnt expect pantera to be frequently entering and exiting deals though he said the fund would take steps to preserve its profitability and maximize opportunity if warranted were going to make relative value judgements if the token has reached a fair value and theres a new token thats inexpensive we would trade he said but were investing in tokens were not making markets krug also explained a bit about how it will seek to make technical evaluations on the prospects of various projects evaluating the technical foundations of the designs of proposed protocols as well as the strength of the team its worth noting that investing in icos is still an inexact science as owing to the difficulty of changing blockchain infrastructure protocols its unknown whether pivoting will be as easy for entrepreneurs building on top of the tech thats where pantera is hoping krugs experience will pay dividends augur raised m in an ico for its ethereumbased prediction market platform in  through the sale of tokens that power its reputation system today its network is valued at m with tokens trading for  at press time according to data from coinmarketcap bubble talk also discussed was the rapid escalation in value observed in the total cryptocurrency market which surpassed bn earlier this year up from bn on st january and the effect of what some have called a bubble forming in the market still krug sought to take a more longterm view asserting that despite shortterm fluctuations hes confident that the ico process will emerge as a compelling way to fund protocol development one that will continue to interest investors and entrepreneurs in the long term were at the very beginning he remarked likewise morehead said that as with its bitcoin fund the ico fund is likely to see ups and downs overall he focused on the fact that the funds would expand panteras investment capabilities while helping to fund and fuel growth in the market krug concluded hopefully this will see through corrections coin collection via shutterstock the leader in blockchain news coindesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic

was part of a compilers course at the catholic university of uruguay and consisted in building a compiler for a clike programming language from scratch we believe this project could be useful to anyone attending a compilers course interested in compilers or just curious about how a compiler might work internally the language our compiler takes as input called l supports most constructs from c variables branches loops functions recursion and io albeit with some limitations and some additions the l compiler generates java bytecode l programs can be run on any platform with a java vm installed this program was developed a long time ago and this was both emilio and is second largest c program at the time consequently the code should not be considered good c programming style this program is free software licensed under the gplv feel free to download the code explore how it works tweak it and redistribute it to your friends the following section presents some examples of the l programming language in action we also have a programming guide available in pdf format lhello worldl should look familiar to regular users of clike languages heres the mandatory hello world example
