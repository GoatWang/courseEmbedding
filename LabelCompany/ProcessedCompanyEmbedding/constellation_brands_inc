advantages that will drive future growththe companys vertical business model will continue to provide operational efficiencygrowth in wine business will diversify the business and provide additional revenue opportunitiesconstellation brands nysestz has provided investors with incredible returns over the last five yearssource yahoo finance however lately many investors are beginning to think that growth is over and that they should begin to exit their position this article will discuss why we think that stock price growth will continue in the next five years thesis  existing market foothold will guide future growth we believe that the existing foothold the company has within this market alongside a wide array of product lines will provide competitive advantages that will ensure future growth the company is currently the third largest producer and distributor of beer in the us and has ranked number  in terms of premium wine sales specifically the company imports a variety of popular beers from mexico such as modelo especial pacifico negra modelo and corona these brands have displayed market dominance and growth with corona light being ranked the number one imported light beer in terms of revenue and modelo especial consistently ranking in the top  fastestgrowing beer brands when it comes to hard liquors svedka vodka has been extremely successful since launch and has become the second largest imported vodka in the us as can be seen from these examples constellation does a great job establishing its brands regardless of the beverage line it operates in we believe that the economies of scale and distribution networks that are available to the company due to its strong market presence will allow the company to expand to new products and establish them at the top of the market with relative ease the following chart signifies the projected earnings of the company via capital iq estimates that should provide a baseline for probable future growth within the companysource capital iq thesis  strong operational capabilities due to vertical business model we have witnessed significant improvements in the profitability of constellation brands much of which can be attributed to the improved operational efficiencies of the company the chart below shows historical improvements in ebitda margins in addition to projected number for the next three years source capital iq we believe that a significant portion of these efficiencies stems from having a wide variety of production facilities that allows the company to leverage geographical and managerial expertise to produce costefficient products currently the company operates five beer breweries  wineries as well as various warehouses and glass production facilities having a vertically integrated supply chain provides the company with larger margins as it does not have to split revenues with third parties as well as increased flexibility in terms of production we believe that this business model will continue to drive value as the firm increases its margins to an approximate  by  thesis  strategic acquisitions to grow wine business while the beer business has undoubtedly been the focus of the firm in the past we are encouraged by the diversification that is currently taking place we view the focus on ma activity to increase operational efficiencies and enter into new markets as a positive that will drive more value for shareholders constellation brands has specifically focused on expanding its wine products for example in april of  the company acquired the prisoner wine companys brand portfolio this transaction included popular brands such as saldo cuttings thorn and blindfold this particular move was a strategic shift to increase the companys focus on the wine business by expanding its already existing portfolio additionally the company has expanded its existing facilities through additional investment such as its  million investment in the expansion of its marlborough winery we will continue to monitor future investments of this sort and believe that the wine industry could provide the needed growth opportunities to provide solid returns to investors risks first we would like to point out that the company has experienced consistent drops in its net working capital over the last few years the company has gone from having  billion in  to just  million in  source capital iq this may hinder our third thesis that discussed the company making significant investments to grow its wine business we will continue to monitor this closely and recommend that all investors who are interested in this stock to do the same takeaway we like constellation brands due to its existing market position efficient operations vertical business model and strategic expansion into wine we believe this stock will provide  returns for the next five years disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
