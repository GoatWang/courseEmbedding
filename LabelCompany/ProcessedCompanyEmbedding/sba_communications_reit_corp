towers and nols  sba communications corporation nasdaqsbac  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»sba communications data towers and nolsmar  about sba communications sbac longshort value longshort equity value special situationssummarysba communications is in the process of converting to a reit structuresba communications has b of nols that it plans to use to offset reit taxable income allowing it to eliminate reit distributions until sba communications is the cheapest tower reit with the most upside and is about to lap issues it had with the loss of sprint revenues in sba communications nasdaqsbac is a leading wireless communications infrastructure company often referred to as a tower reit or tower company because its main assets are cell phone towers sba is one of three public tower reits that operate mainly in the united states american tower nyseamt and crown castle nysecci are the other two which are both structured as reits sba was originally structured as a corporation and is currently converting to a reit structure like its two peers the company recently completed an internal merger to allow it to file for reit status the ceo discussed the reit conversation status on the recent earnings call in which he called the final step of filling the  tax return a formality and that it has been functionally operating as a reit since prior to  the company has a tremendous amount of nols estimated at b per its latest k these nols are due to years of capital investment and net income losses as it built its tower portfolio these net income losses are due to high depreciation relative to gross margins as some of sbas tower assets are beginning to become fully depreciated the company has started to post a positive net income this was the impetus for the reit conversion which will help the company reduce taxes like its peers going forward with this reit structure change there are some interesting implications on capital investment and nols that i discuss below business segments sba operates two business segments site leasing and site development site leasing is the asset based part of the business that leases towers and other locations to the major telecom companies in which they install their cells within the site leasing segment the company breaks out its domestic and international businesses site development is a consulting and construction business that helps third parties assess and build towers site development is a services business the site leasing business is a very attractive business for a few reasons first due to zoning restrictions and permitting on towers in the united states and most oecd countries individual towers have a high locational value this means that within cities there are a limited number of towers that can be built in a zoning constrained environment each tower has more value especially in densely populated areas in mainly foreign countries ie brazil india and developing nations these zoning restrictions are not as stringent anyone can basically build a tower anywhere they want this is why towers in the us and most oecd countries have a higher long term moat than towers in many international markets towers in developing countries may have better economics now due to the fact that demand for them outpaces supply but without zoning laws to prevent new tower builds the long term moat is not as great as in oecd countries second towers are vital to delivering mobile data to the masses telecom companies rely on the tower companies to support their networks towers are essential to delivering data because of the physics of spectrum signals limits on cells and densities required in urban areas most cell phones in the us use what is known as glte it stands for th generationlong term equivalent before g was g and before that was g the spectrum used in g to g falls within the frequency range between  mhz and  mhz these frequencies have roughly all of the same characteristics when it comes to the distance that each cell serves towers can have either macrocells or microcells on them depending on a few factors but both are required for a diverse strong cellular network g which will be the next generation of spectrum to be rolled out in  will essentially be the same when it comes to the use case for towers basically my point is towers have a very significant long term technological moat which makes them essential for supporting mobile networks and future data needs of societies capital allocation and nols as i highlighted above sba has a significant amount of nols that will last them for the next few years reits must distribute to their stockholders an amount equal to at least  of the reit taxable income reit taxable income can be offset by nols per the irs tax code on reits this is an advantage for sba when comparing them to the other tower reits american tower and crown castle distributed m and m in dividends in the last  months these distributions were made basically at a pretax or no tax level as with all reit structures but for investors those distributions are taxed on a personal level assuming you owned american tower or crown castle and reinvested all of your dividends into the stock you would have to pay tax on your dividends received largely as ordinary income as you are probably aware ordinary income is taxed at your individual tax rate which can now be up to  while this difference is small there is still a material impact on the available capital that sbac will keep tax free and be able to reinvest into new towers acquisitions or purchasing land how does one value these nols then in a reit structure the traditional way to values nols for a normal company is to take the nols amount guess what years nols will be used to shield the company from taxes and then take the tax savings as a cashflow based on those cashflows you create a discounted cashflow analysis to determine the current value of the nols an easy shortcut for finding the value of nols is to take the total nols and multiply by the tax rate although this slightly overstates the value due to timing of cashflows so how do you value nols for a reit that essentially doesnt have a tax rate lets compare sbac assuming it has the nols versus assuming it doesnt have the nols and take the difference sba has b of nols reits are required to distribute  of their net income that means sbac is able to forego distributing roughly b of capital that would have been distributed to shareholders in lieu of these nols so the incremental value of the nols is equal to b x your personal tax rate which can be different for each investor if you are in a high tax bracket the value should be higher to you than someone in a lower tax bracket outside of the calculation of value of the nols saved on taxes there is an additional source of value that b of capital that is retained inside sba instead of distributing it to investors will be reinvested into the companys many high roe opportunities the money will be used to purchase more towers more land and make acquisitions that b will compound within the corporate structure of sba for sba b will go a long way as its total assets right now is around b valuation tower reits are difficult to value largely because their assets have incredibly long tails due to the way that depreciation of the towers assets work using net income to determine value of tower reits makes little sense to value tower reits you need to look at either funds from operations ffo or adjusted funds from operations affo which adjusts for rent increases capital expenditures and routine maintenance sba has both a better growth profile and a higher shareholder return than its two competitors going into  american tower has a much stronger track record of growth over the past  years than sbac which does make the company also very attractive the leverage profiles of the three companies are also different with sbac having the higher net debtaffo of the three if you are comfortable with the business model and believe that towers will be around for many years to come as i do i believe sbac offers the best return of the three american tower would be a close second and offers a more international footprint than sba with a different leverage ratio and a dividend which is likely more
