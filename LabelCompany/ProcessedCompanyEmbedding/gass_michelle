coffee shop as senior vpchief merchant global product for starbucks corp michelle gass presides over the worldwide product and development teams for  products and most of the companys revenue its a massive challenge as the chain works to rein in the commoditization famously outlined in a recent company memo from chairman howard schultz michelle gass senior vpchief merchant global product starbucks corp this is just the beginning of the journey for michelle says jim donald starbucks presidentceo who dismisses the memo as business as usual of all things he says ms gass has a very high sense of urgency such motivation helped her drive frappuccino from a twoflavor novelty at the seattlebased coffee chain into a  billion brand in talking with customers she realized they were using the creamy drinks more as a miniescape than as a coffee break but when it came to how the drinks were served and marketed there was a pretty big disconnect says the yearold maine native who holds a degree in chemical engineering and an mba as with poorly shot vacation photos the full experience was lost in the visual when she prepared to launch the caramel frappuccino ms gass envisioned a bigger potential for the beverage to create an emotional indulgence factor she proposed adding a caramel drizzle and domed lid to dress up the drink and switching the generic red straw to green to reinforce the brand iconography these seemingly small changes became a big battle with baristas and operations management who argued they would complicate operations and slow service amid a heated debate with a ranking executive ms gass refused to launch without the drizzle or domed lid if you dont do it in its full concept then you cant have it ms gass asserted she says im a quantitative person but when it comes to decisions and conviction im more about passion and gut if you take the easy road all the time if you go with squirt a little bit of syrup in it it might be a hit but wont be a big innovation if we had not done that i dont know if wed have the frappuccino business we have today shes smart enough to recognize that weve got  focus groups that take place in our stores every day and listens to what she hears and modifies appropriately says jim alling presidentstarbucks coffee us headlinegrabbing memo aside ms gass considers food to be her biggest challenge were still figuring that out she says its going to be a journey but its a key priority for us for me food is the next frappuccino in this article special report women to watch  most popular become a member register now renew

seattle’s best coffee president michelle gass turning around brand  the seattle times skip to content menu search business business businessfood  drinkstarbucks seattle’s best coffee president michelle gass turning around brand originally published may   at  pm updated may   at  am seattles best coffee president michelle gass is known at starbucks headquarters for transforming frappuccinos in the s into its most popular beverage the key was her insistence on a visually appealing drink with caramel drizzle and a plastic domed lid share story by melissa allison if howard schultz has a goto executive michelle gass is it when schultz returned as starbucks’ ceo two years ago he quickly snatched her away from marketing and product oversight to serve in his new twoperson “office of the ceo” which meant talking strategy and next steps with him oneonone “we were courageous and disruptive” gass says of that effort “i felt unleashed with his energy and vision and willingness to be courageous for someone like me who thrives on that it was like ‘wow this is going to be a ride’ “ after their turnaround plan jelled gass orchestrated some of the chain’s biggest moves — including putting together teams to launch starbucks’ loyaltycard program and its instant coffee most read storieswoman  lost in olympic national park with dog built shelter ate antsstarbucks closes teavana

seattle as no  place in the world to live survey shows  fyi guy teens killed in lynnwood crash from mill creek high schoolunlimited digital access  for  weekshaving joined starbucks when it had just  stores — compared with more than  now — gass knows the company well and has a strong sense of what customers want after years of successes and flops — notably a chocolate drink called chantico that lasted only a year she is known at headquarters for transforming frappuccinos in the s into starbucks’ most popular beverage the key was her insistence on a visually appealing drink with caramel drizzle and a plastic domed lid when the head of operations complained about the added complexity gass refused to launch without the embellishments she had customer feedback to support the idea that theater was important for that particular beverage and she had the gumption to stand behind it frappuccinos now bring in more than  billion a year in sales out of the company’s  billion total as schultz puts it gass “possesses a rare leadership combination of courage conviction and belief in her people that has made her an invaluable asset to starbucks” about the time gass and her team rolled out starbucks’ instant coffee in  schultz called her into his office he wanted her to head up seattle’s best coffee a chain starbucks had bought in  and not done much with it had about  cafes most of them in borders bookstores her only orders were to “make it huge and you get to own it all” on a mission in fewer than two years on the job she is well on her way gass — which rhymes with “floss” — has overhauled the identity of seattle’s best making it big and bold and completely separate from starbucks seattle’s best coffee is sold now at  locations including subway and burger king shops amc theatres and the united nations building in new york schultz has said he expects it to become a  billion brand it’s growing in the double digits now but starbucks won’t say how big it is gass  has no illusions about seattle’s best becoming the next starbucks which is known for its cafés her vision is for seattle’s best to bring good coffee to people wherever they are from fastfood restaurants to hotels “what if seattle’s best could be the brand that basically eradicates all the bad coffee out there” she asks eyes lit by the possibility gass wants to “create an emotional connection around fun and optimism and a level of approachability and simplicity” it sounds a lot like her a runner who majored in chemical engineering she learned while working at procter  gamble in cincinnati that she prefers consumers to chemical plants “it’s about the humanity the emotion” gass said “people are complex they’re ever changing and evolving” after six years at procter  gamble she moved with her husband scott gass to seattle which they loved for its entrepreneurial opportunities and vibrancy gass met someone from starbucks while working on her mba at the university of washington and started as the frappuccino marketing manager in 6 it was a yearold drink at that point and wellliked but nothing indicated it would be a sales wonder until gass added her touches she has made changes to the seattle’s best look too unveiling a new logo for the brand and numbering and color coding its packaged coffees so that customers can easily understand what kind of roast they are buying “i would literally stand in a grocery store and watch people try to pick their coffee and in some cases they would turn away without anything” gass said “everything had gotten pretty serious and dark and everything looked the same” no  and no  which are yellow and orange are lighter blends than either seattle’s best or starbucks has offered before — the kind of roast that often appeals to people coming off a folgers habit and the lineup of five coffee packages is conspicuously missing starbucks green gass has a talent for knowing what customers will like said chris bruzzo starbucks’ online chief who has worked with her closely during his five years at the company “when we’re in meetings and she says something is a ‘big idea’ that’s when you know you’ve got it” said bruzzo who remembers gass using that phrase to describe many ideas during starbucks’ turnaround — including the notion of using a taste challenge to persuade customers to try its new instant coffee head for details experience with starbucks products obviously helps but gass also spends a lot of time talking to customers he said “understanding what they think and care about” she also knows how to motivate people bruzzo said gass moved the  people who work for seattle’s best coffee from disparate cubicles all over the building into a new separate space at headquarters that features redcarpet red as prominently as the rest of the building does green “she gets people to work stronger harder to be more committed and have an ‘everything matters’ mentality” bruzzo said gass’ engineering background gives her a strong grasp of numbers and details which help make her a clear thinker who conveys her ideas easily to the people she works with but her heart leans toward marketing and branding take her enthusiasm about even seattle’s best coffee’s name the name — seattle — oh my gosh not only will that translate in the us but it will translate globally” there are no plans to move seattle’s best into foreign markets beyond canada focus brands operates seattle’s best locations in a handful of countries including japan an arrangement that was struck before starbucks bought the company and does not bring it any money gass’ fun side comes out in all aspects of the brand seattle’s best business cards are now color coded to match its new coffee packages and they include feisty quips like “your eyes won’t open themselves” and “my other business card takes cream and sugar” and she gets jazzed about the carton for seattle’s best coffee’s new canned coffees on the bottom are icons of a rain cloud a coffee mug and a bicycle — along with a reminder that it’s from seattle “where folks drink more coffee than water” “i’m a zealot about the thoughtfulness of the details” gass said “to start over with a brand is so refreshing because everything we do is an opportunity to connect with the consumer or a potential business partner” melissa allison 66 or mallisonseattletimescom melissa allison view comments no

longvacant merchandising job to exstarbucks exec michelle gass june    comments share michelle gassmilwaukee journal sentinel by rick romell of the journal sentinel june    michelle gass the former starbucks executive who came to kohls corp two years ago amid a wave of organizational change has been named chief merchandising officer at the big retailerthe appointment fills a critical post at kohls one that has stood vacant for  months it also solidifies gass standing as a prime candidate to one day succeed kevin mansell as ceo of the  billion company which employs thousands of people at its menomonee falls headquartersits a good move analyst patrick mckeever of mkm partners said ive been pretty impressed by michelle since she joined the company shes a rising star and i think it makes sensein an email mark altschwager of robert w baird  co said he too has been impressed by the leadership and energy gass has brought to kohls the move increases the odds that she will ultimately succeed mansell altschwager saidkohls also said thursday that it has begun an external search for a chief operating officer — a new position for the firm whomever is chosen for that role also likely will be an eventual ceo candidatemany observers had expected kohls to announce a new chief merchant months ago but the decision to go with gass emerged as the company began embarking on a sweeping series of initiatives it calls the greatness agenda mansell said in an interviewgass who has been credited with playing a key role in starbucks turnaround of a few years ago joined kohls in june  as the firm was working to rebound from mediocre sales performance and operational misstepsnamed chief customer officer she has overseen ecommerce marketing and efforts to more fully engage consumers through such measures as a loyalty rewards program that has attracted some  million membersas kohls searched for a new chief merchant — the executive who oversees the planning development and allocation of the apparel home goods and other products sold in the chains  department stores and online business — mansell increasingly saw that role as tightly connected to the work gass was already spearheadingit became more clear everyday that these two things customer engagement and product are linked completely he saidthat pointed toward gass as a logical person to head up merchandising and mansell began seriously weighing that option as long as a year ago but given gass relatively thin experience with departmentstore retailing mansell wanted to make sure she was readymichelle has been new to our industry and our sector so there was a learning curve mansell said actually shes not entirely new to the industry just before joining kohls she spent four and a half years on the board of ann inc operator of more than  womens apparel stores under the ann taylor and loft brandsand running kohls ecommerce operations for two years has given gass indepth knowledge of kohls products and supply structure mansell saidshes ready for this he said she is more than readywith comparablestore sales growing the last two quarters after five straight quarters of yearoveryear declines it should be clear that gass is making a big difference mansell saidaltschwager noted gass lack of extensive merchandising experience before joining kohls but he said that with the companys large team of merchandise management and product development executives the chief merchant role is more about leadership and strategic direction than having an eye for fashion trendsgass new title will be chief merchandising and customer officer she will retain most of her previous responsibilities with mansell taking over digital and ecommerce strategies and operations until a chief operating officer is foundbesides digital technology and ecommerce the chief operating officer will oversee kohls store operations supply chain and logistics like every legacy retailer kohls is looking for the most effective way to appeal to consumers who increasingly tote smartphones and combine online shopping with the traditional brickandmortar variety placing the same person in charge of both digital and physicalstore operations will speed kohls progress along that path mansell saidits a different way to structure but i think its the future for us he saidin the merchandising role gass replaces donald brennan who resigned in march  he had received a relatively low performance rating for the previous yearmansell who is 6 and has been ceo since august  has no plans to retire but he said that as kohls chief executive and chairman of its board of directors he wants the board to have choices in succession planningand i want enough timeto evaluate the performance of specific executives he said about
