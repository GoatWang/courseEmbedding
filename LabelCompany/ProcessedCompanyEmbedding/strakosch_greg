a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures accompanies our shareholder letter with that i will turn the call over to greg greg strakosch great thanks jane techtarget executed very well in  we faced a challenging macroenvironment all year as our largest customers business plans were unexpectedly disrupted by the strong dollar we are in an early innings of a major trend as our customers want to take advantage of big data to grow their market share this trend is gaining momentum we are well positioned to take advantage of this trend with our proprietary it purchase intent data we introduced three major products under the it deal alert umbrella in  deal data priority engine and techtarget research all three are off to a good start and will contribute to revenue growth in  our organic traffic in search was up  in  as our investment in independent high quality content continues to pay off financially in an environment where marketing budgets were flat at best we grew revenue and profits  was our th consecutive year of being cash flow positive we repurchased approximately  million worth of stock in  and our board has authorized an additional  million to be used for stock repurchases reflecting our confidence in the business i will now open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from brian fitzgerald of jefferies unidentified analyst hi guys this is john on for fitz quick question for you you announced the launch of the research product then you noted that you signed the first few contracts already last quarter could you talk a little bit about the types of customers that you’re signing for that product and how they are engaging with it thanks greg strakosch yeah so it’s  we’ve been signing up tenders it’s typically their market research are competitive intelligence teams and they are very interested in seeing what customers’ future buying plans as well what is happening in the specific markets in terms of who is winning deals who is losing deals street price and et cetera so that’s the first place that we’re going to on the investor side what we’re learning there is investors want to have some historical data so they can see some trends so we anticipated that so that will be a later developing revenue stream unidentified analyst great thank you and then have you guys  you noted that the largest  clients kind of struggled in q have you seen any turnaround in the beginning of the year so far have you heard anything qualitative that has given you some optimism for the rest of  thanks greg strakosch it’s still early in the year and as you know seasonally as you know q is always  it’s always slow it’s the smallest quarter of the year so i think on the positive side for  is no one is going to be caught off guard with the strong dollar last year it was unexpected this year people know about it also our largest customers will be calendaring the effects of the strong dollar so my expectation is that those two factors will be favorable but in terms of what we’re thinking for the year i think that’s reflected in our annual guidance unidentified analyst great thank you greg strakosch you’re welcome operator the next question comes from kerry rice of needham kerry rice thanks a lot maybe to dovetail with that last question you did provide the details between top spenders and kind of the balance of the customers within those top spenders is there anything you would call out maybe anybody that is still actually positively spending versus the contraction and or is maybe some of that contraction largely driven by the dellemc merger and a falloff in spending there that’s the first question and then you highlighted for it deal alert that you expect about  growth in  with upside to  could you talk a little bit about what would be those  would drive the up to  growth is there anything has the priority engine kind of the outperformance or anything there and then i will have one followup question thanks greg strakosch yeah so in terms of the top  and i don’t want to get into specific customers but those companies many of those customers have more than  of their revenue outside the us and they were severally affected by the strong dollar so as i said that’s across the board and then it’s no secret that some of those top customers are in the middle of mergers and spin offs and divestitures which can create additional uncertainty so i think its pretty clear what’s going on with the top customers i mean everyone they’re all public and everyone can follow what’s happening there in terms of it deal alert i’d say the fastest places growing we’re seeing very good acceleration with priority engine as you can see we doubled the number of new customers that we brought in this quarter versus last quarter but starting to sign some annual contracts which is a nice development so i think there is some very good upside there and then techtarget research i think there is definitely upside there i think because it’s new that we’re forecasting somewhat conservatively because there is not you don’t have a past track record to go on but we fired our few sales people there we started to sign some deals pipeline is building nicely the customers that have seen the data have really liked it it’s very unique so i think that’s another area where there would be some significant upside and then of course it’s still very early innings and we have new products that we’ll be announcing this year as well so all those things combined i think provide the potential for upside kerry rice great and just one followup on the strong organic search is there anything that you have changed or tweaked that kind of led to that ultimate high or anything that you would call out there greg strakosch yeah i think there is a few things we continue to invest in very specific targeted content i think we’ve seen a retrenchment from our competitors i think they’re producing less quality of relevant content so that helps us and then in general i would say that we the google the way the algorithm is changing it’s very focused on the quality of the content which really plays to our strength so we’ve done some things there with our editorial team just to reinforce what we’ve always been doing but there was another algorithm refresh on january th by google and we’ve been performing very well with doubledigit traffic growth since that refresh since that new algorithm change in january so all things very positive on that front kerry rice thank you operator next we have a question from kyle evans of stephens kyle evans hi thanks for taking my questions few more on the research product greg i believe you said in the past that will be in deal alert i just first wanted to confirm that greg strakosch that’s correct kyle evans okay and then going forward i’m hoping you’re going to say yes so you are going to be breaking out research in progress there and any more detail maybe in your commentaries on the calls going forward greg strakosch yeah i mean i don’t expect that we are going to break it out from a line item and report on the revenue and let the whole world know exactly what we are doing but yeah we’ll continue to provide color so you get a feel for what’s happening there and i think it’s going to be very positive so we’ll definitely be giving some color on that kyle evans okay can you detail some of your thinking around the  you gave basically a  million run rate by the end of next year you’ve got your first deals in hand the simple math is you  up at  to get to that goal what were some of the things that you were thinking about when you put that fourth quarter of next year out here as a timeline greg strakosch yeah so we look at the number of customers that we think that are good candidates to buy it we look at the number of sales people that we’ve hired and have plans to hire and kind of what revenue ramp would be for those sales people we’ve made some assumptions on renewal rates and up sells and cross sells so kind of the basic things you do as you do a revenue build up but as you know this is a very large opportunity our customer spend huge amounts of money and have dedicated budgets for this and there is obviously gartner and idc and forester there is a lot of companies generating hundreds of millions of dollars in the space so it’s a very big opportunity for us kyle evans how much historical data do you need before you can kind of pursue the investment community i think about all the overpriced data products that we buy and my peers buy and my clients buy and if you in fact have real time pricing and market share and street pricing to me  seems very reasonable greg strakosch yeah i think the early adopters two or three quarters of trend data everyone we show in the investment community we saw a chorus ph with the data they’re saying hey this is extremely interesting it’s very unique we’ve never seen anything like this we can see how it would be very valuable but just looking at one quarter without being able to discern a trend it’s hard for me to take action on it so i think that every quarter that we generate more data there will be more people interested obviously yearoveryear data is going to be extremely attractive so i think we definitely have early adopters looking for quarteroverquarter and then more people as we get to yearoveryear that product will gain traction kyle evans okay one last question and then i’ll get back in the queue could you talk specifically about it deal alert in that top  and then also internationally international is the one place where it looks like you came up a little bit short and were maybe going backwards interested in your thoughts in both of those areas greg strakosch so international as you would imagine is the most directly affected those budgets are most directly affected by the strong dollar and the other part that you can imagine international is  has a higher percentage of revenue from big customers because they do so much business over there so i think that’s the story on the international it deal alert and then in terms of the top  we definitely  what we saw a weakness across the board from the top  across all products because when they are cutting budgets we have pretty good penetration there they’re cutting across the board kyle evans when you look at your it deal alert customer base is the top  fairly well representative there greg strakosch yeah in general our business is about  from the  about  from midsized companies and  from dc back startups and i would say that that breakout is generally reflective in our it deal alert products as well kyle evans okay great thank you greg strakosch youre welcome operator the next question comes from mike malouf with craighallum mike malouf great thanks for taking my questions i’m curious greg if you could comment i know that we had previously asked and i think we have had discussion about the concern that perhaps north american core online revenue could be cannibalized by a real successful it deal alert it looks like it deal alert continues to do well even on the international side you are still looking for  growth but the real swing factor is as the north american core online so i’m just wondering has there been some sort of unanticipated cannibalization that’s going on in that greg strakosch yeah now when i think the numbers prove that out since we’ve announced it deal alert in zero to  million of revenue in two and half years our north american core revenue has been roughly flat so that it deal alert revenue has been incremental growth and i would say that the it deal alert is actually reinforces the value proposition of the core because the great thing about the it deal alert is it identified deals that are in progressed and that was maybe some maybe in the middle of the process and what our customers are always asking us is hey how can we influence these deals early and then the answer there as well you got to be influencing these people early in the research process with branding with microsites with white papers with webcast so i think that that’s i think the number speaks for themselves that hasn’t been cannibalistic and i think that it’s actually reinforces the value proposition mike malouf okay and then just switching gears on the investor side of the new product you said that that’s  that they really need some history on that before they step up are you planning to sort of back basically populate the dataset with the historical data and then give it to the investors or are you just going to have to wait for some time to go by to populated with sort of future data and then give it to greg strakosch yeah so we weren’t collecting the specific data that we’re collecting today is much more in depth than the data we were collecting in the past because we weren’t using we now have the idea to product size it so that data that we’re collecting that’s going to have to be we have to be patient and just each quarter we’ll have new data but the first time we published it was q of this year and we don’t have data from before then to publish mike malouf how long do you think it will take to get some traction there then greg strakosch well in the storage space for example in q we’ll have our second quarter and q we’ll have our third quarter so i think we will as we continue to get quarteroverquarter we’ll start to get some early adopters we’ve had a quite a few investors that are very interested in the date we’re having a lot of conversations and the feedback has been good mike malouf okay great thanks a lot greg strakosch you’re welcome operator showing no further questions the conference is now concluded thank you for attending today’s presentation you
