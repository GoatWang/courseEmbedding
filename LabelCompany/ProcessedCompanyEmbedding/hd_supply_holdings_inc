person to contact in connection with this report   check the appropriate box to indicate the rule pursuant to which this form is being filed and provide the period to which the information in this form applies   o    rule p under the securities exchange act  cfr p for the reporting period from january  to december           section   conflict minerals disclosure   item  conflict minerals disclosure and report   conflict minerals disclosure   introduction   hd supply holdings inc and hd supply inc collectively with their direct and indirect whollyowned subsidiaries hd supply or the company comprise one of the largest industrial distributors in north america we believe we have leading positions in the three distinct market sectors in which we specialize maintenance repair  operations infrastructure and specialty construction we operate through approximately  locations across  us states and six canadian provinces we have approximately  associates delivering localized customertailored products services and expertise we serve approximately  customers which include contractors government entities maintenance professionals home builders and industrial businesses our broad range of endtoend product lines and services include approximately  stockkeeping units of quality namebrand and proprietarybrand products as well as valueadd services supporting the entire lifecycle of a project from infrastructure and construction to maintenance repair and operations   the company does not directly manufacture products but contracts to manufacture based on its suppliers branded and generic products containing metallic forms of gold tin tungsten and tantalum or tgs  the efforts described herein were undertaken on the exclusive andor privatelybranded products which we sourced directly or were otherwise specifically manufactured for the company during calendar year    certain hd supply products contain materials or components that use metallic forms of tin tantalum tungsten andor gold  generally speaking the amount of information available globally on the traceability and sourcing of these ores is limited at this time  the company has taken steps to identify the applicable smelters and refiners of such tg metals in our supply chain however due to the depth of the supply chain the company is far removed from the sources of ore from which these metals are produced and the smeltersrefiners that process those ores  the company relies on its suppliers to provide information on the origin of any conflict minerals contained in components and materials supplied to us   reasonable country of origin inquiry rcoi   direct suppliers were asked to provide answers to the supply chain questionnaire adapted from the electronic industry citizenship coalitionglobal esustainability initiatives eiccgesi conflict minerals common reporting template cmrt reflecting hd supplys position on the supply chain  the cmrt was developed by several of the worlds leading consumer electronics companies and is regarded as the most common reporting tool for conflict minerals content and sourcing information worldwide   the company reviewed the questionnaires received for completeness and consistency of answers  suppliers were required to provide corrections and clarifications where needed   as such the company believes the rcoi process followed was reasonably designed and performed in good faith  however there are inherent limitations in the information provided by third parties including but not limited to potential inaccuracies incompleteness or falsified information despite the companys efforts to validate and confirm the information      determination   since the company received inconclusive data from our direct suppliers the company is unable to make a definitive determination about the sources of the tgs contained in the majority of  its products subject to inquiry by rule ­p for the period from january   to december   the reporting period however with respect to a small minority of  products subject to inquiry by rule ­p for the reporting period the company did receive information from some direct suppliers that leads the company to believe that there is reason to believe that tgs contained in those certain products may have originated in the democratic republic of  congo or an adjoining country collectively the covered countries or did not come from recycled or scrap sources   pursuant to the public statement issued by the secs division of corporation finance on april   we have only provided the disclosure required under the provisions of paragraphs a and b of item  of form sd   additional information   a copy of the information contained in this form sd is also publicly
