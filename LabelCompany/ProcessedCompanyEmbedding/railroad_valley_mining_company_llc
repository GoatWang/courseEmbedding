valley surface samples assay up to  ppm lithium lithium nevada vancouver british columbia june   globe newswire  macarthur minerals limited tsxvmms the “company” or “macarthur minerals” is pleased to announce that it has expanded its lithium brine project portfolio staking the reynolds springs lithium brine project in nevada on which it has located lithium at surface of up to  parts per million “ppm” lithium “li” the company has staked  new unpatented placer mining claims at its new reynolds springs lithium brine project “reynolds springs project” in the railroad valley nevada three surface samples at the reynolds springs project returned  to  ppm li figure  figure  location of the reynolds spring project and results of soil samples david taplin president ceo and director of macarthur minerals commented “macarthur minerals is excited about its staking of new claims in the railroad valley in nevada the new claims forming the reynolds spring project are located on the railroad valley playa which historically records the largest lithium soil anomaly in the state of nevada the railroad valley claims were chosen because the valley has geological attributes that closely match the clayton valley which hosts north america’s only producing lithium mine albemarle’s silver peak lithium mine macarthur minerals believes based on a sampling program conducted in the railroad valley it has staked some of the most prospective ground for lithium in that valley” reynolds springs project – geological setting the new claims are located near the town of currant in nye county nevada the reynolds springs project is located approximately  miles  km north of las vegas nevada and  miles  km south east of tesla’s new gigafactory figure  figure  regional location of macarthur mineral’s reynolds spring project and stonewall lithium project railroad valley is a large topographically closed playa dry salt lake bed basin located in eastcentral nevada the basin is fault bounded with numerous active thermal springs anomalous in lithium emerging along the faults the fault sets have strike lengths of  –  miles  –  km and are parallel to each other about  miles apart the faults that bound the basin form an elongate rectangular shaped basin of about  square miles  square km in size numerous thermal springs emerge along the basin bounding fault systems which form the northwest and southeast flanks of the playa basin thermal waters which discharge from the springs carry moderately anomalous values of lithium water samples collected from reynolds springs by macarthur minerals’ consulting geologists averaged  parts per billion “ppb” li and  ppb boron this about twice the concentration for these elements detected from water samples collected at other springs that were sampled in the valley the mountains that surround the basin contain outcropping rock units are also anomalous in lithium this closely matches the geologic criteria for the united state geological survey “usgs” deposit model for clayton valley type lithium brine deposits macarthur minerals believes that the combination of anomalous lithium in soils  ppm and anomalous lithium in thermal spring waters  ppb li indicates that the reynolds springs project area is favorable for further exploration historical data prior to staking the claims macarthur minerals completed an analysis of usgs historical soil rock and groundwater data collected across california nevada and utah sediment samples collected in the s during the united states department of energy’s national uranium resource evaluation program “nure” were of particular interest spatial analysis of the historical data shows railroad valley to be the largest lithium soil anomaly in the state of nevada a total of  soils samples were collected by nure across nevada and analysed for uranium lithium and other elements eightyseven  samples returned lithium values in excess of  ppm a cluster of  samples greater than  ppm were collected from railroad valley the other area identified from the nure dataset that had similar elevated lithium levels was the clayton valley which hosts north america’s only producing lithium mine albemarle’s silver peak lithium mine in comparison approximately  samples were collected from the clayton valley and surrounding the silver peak mine a total of nine samples reported assays greater than  ppm with samples ranging from  to  ppm li reconnaissance soil sampling in the railroad valley by macarthur minerals’ consulting geologists narrowed the area of interest to the reynolds springs area on the northwest flank of the playa basin  a total of five widely spaced reconnaissance soil samples were collected from the reynolds springs area  analysis of these samples by als chemex labs using the me – icp and icp methods returned a range of values for the five samples ranging from  –  ppm li average  ppm li and a range of  –  ppm b average  ppm boron the water and soil sample results mentioned above were compared to results from other reconnaissance samples collected elsewhere in the railroad valley  this demonstrated that the reynolds springs area appeared to be enriched in lithium  as a result of that analysis a total of  new acre unpatented placer mining claims were staked as indicated in figure  next steps for the reynolds springs project the company has recently completed a  point geochemical soils sampling program across the reynolds springs project concurrent with the claim staking samples have been submitted to the laboratory for assay and will be reported when data is available following analysis of this wide spaced sampling program the company will consider an infill sampling program across areas considered highly prospective for lithium macarthur minerals is also currently undertaking a review of hyperspectral aster satellite imagery of railroad valley to identify additional prospective areas the reynolds spring project is located only  miles kms from the company’s stonewall project in the lida valley nevada the close location of the reynolds springs project and stonewall project will allow sharing of resources and expertise for
