blog stevenjeffes social media marketing crm corporate innovation blog social media marketing crm corporate innovation search homeabout posts comments crm marketing social media customer profitability customer service corporate innovation sales techniques  strategies uncategorized change management customer strategy blow away your competition by replacing your old crm program with the new customer relevant relationship management crrm model – part  the necessary components march    comments  introduction in my previous blog i covered what the new customer relevant relationship model crrm is and the benefits of adopting this new model in this blog i will cover the components of the new crrm model and what you need to put in place to make this new model a reality ever wonder why companies like espn apple google zynga amazon and marriott dominate their respective markets the reason is that they are ‘customer first’ organizations and are passionate about listening to understanding and then delighting their customers based on leveraging true customer insights they treat their customers as business partners vs commodities and include them in many critical decision making processes they get this new crrm model whyhow  – read the rest of this blog to find out… the differences between the old crm model and how these companies are embracing the newer crrm model are depicted in the following chart the old crm model vs new crrm model – customers as business partners  customers are fed up with old dictatorial management style  want to be empowered as business partners customers and stakeholders today are longing for a company to partner with them and include them in the corporate decision making process  these same constituencies are sick and tired of political corporate and other organizations making unilateral decisions for them that are really not inline with their needs  wants etc the backlash from this unwanted dictatorial management style of some companies can be seen in the bank of america fee customer rebellion the customer backlash from netflix deciding to  split their company without first consulting with their customers and hps initial decision to exit the computer market  components of the new crrm model in order to progress your organization from the old crm model to the new crrm  model a few key essentials must be put in place and are as follows a new crrm model that includes the ° cultivation of customer  market insights  this model enables a ° view of all customer and market insights including customer feedback preferences likes dislikes social sentiment competitor activity etc this new model takes your insights to an entirely new level whereby you are now enabled to delight customers stakeholders and stockholders by having insights that are lightyears ahead of insights provided by a traditional crm model b customer first culture driven by management that is passionate about their customers including a set of customer first principles and guidelines developed by company leaders c customer ratings  feedback structure that will identify areas where you will collect customer ° feedback from customer and stakeholder interactions d customer feedback  preferences cultivation process and corresponding infrastructure in order to allow your customers to continually rate how well you are serving them e customer health
