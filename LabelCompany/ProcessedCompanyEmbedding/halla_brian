may   santa clara california rw brian halla served in a number of positions at control data and intel before joining lsi logic as executive vice president of the product group in may  he joined national semiconductor as president and ceo up until that time hed been involved almost exclusively with digital products in this  interview brian describes the many positives associated with the less glamorous but more profitable analog semiconductors   rw tell us about growing up your family siblings  tell us about that   bh yeah i grew up in fort dodge iowa with three brothers and a sister and my dad was the resident fbi agent for thirteen some counties in the midwest and went to school at the university of nebraska  squeezed in a four year ee course into five and started my first job at control data corporation ive had to have had the most fabulous career anybody could ever want control data was time spent helping get the cdc s into nasa so they could put a man on the moon and we all watched that first footstep and    rw and that used discreet transistors theyre not    bh the transistors actually  those first mainframes used ferrite core magnets for the memories and then these three young guys from fairchild came along and integrated a bunch of transistors to create the first thousand one thousand bit dram but my second gig is going to intel in  from control data which of course no longer exists which was really kind of a government house to intel was the difference between night and day it was everybody constantly bouncing off walls the company was just a little tiny company then and theres so much electricity all the time  all the time and my first week on the bob noyce and grove and moore invited me to have lunch with them in a conference room and i thought this is just unbelievable  unbelievable but you know intel was an experience ill never forget i spent fourteen years there but it was always at general quarters and that was just the way andy ran the company and people used to say if times were supposed to be good how come it feels so bad but obviously it got the desired results and then  moved over to lsi logic to get the company in the microprocessor business met rob walker on the first day i think and you know there was kind of you know if cdc was the man on the moon and intel was the microprocessor businesses and being part of the starting of the pc era lsi logic was the system on a chip days and helping sony come out with the sony play station and lsi during the early nineties was i think two years in a row the best performing stock in the new york stock exchange thanks to the sony play station and sun microsystems and a couple of other little companies like that came over to national in  with an intention of staying here for a couple of years and as of today i believe im celebrating my ten year anniversary so that means it was eighteen years ago that you and i first met times fun when youre having flies   rw well why go into engineering what led you to that   bh you know we ask all of our engineers that because theres as you know in the united states  theres a shortage of engineers a shortage of math and science graduates my first interest was when i got a shrinkwrapped transistor radio that plugged it all together and listened to that little ear piece and sure enough there was a voice lot of people said they got into engineering because of their first heath kit or whatever but  so it was really that first transistor radio and i must also confess that trying to pick what course of study i would take in college was influenced by a time magazine that came out while i was a senior in high school and it had all of the starting salaries of graduates so i went down the right hand column to the biggest number and then read over and it said electrical engineering and out of twentythree pledge brothers that all started in ee that year i was the only one that made it all the way through and im glad i did   rw took an extra year   bh yeah took that fifth year   rw yes so did it take me and this was before the asians arrived in  en masse it would take a little longer now   bh yeah   rw like forever well you  you started out as really a digital guy and computers and intel and so on and  and similarly at lsi logic that was essentially all digital except for that screwy english deal where they were going to build analog and they never did that  but now youve converted over that  youre kind of an analog   bh you know actually at lsi when we were putting systems on a chip we had one analog guy in the product group and this guy was  he was stranger than everybody else you know the only thing kind of normal about him was he was his daughters volleyball coach and so id run into him at volleyball games but he wanted to leave the company and go back to the midwest  he was the only analog engineer we had and so we decided that you know you go through a crisis like losing a guy whos vital to it that  that time he was working on lvds and which was of course invented at national and you realize what a crisis it is to lose the analog part of the business so we had at that time wilf had a rec freeze but we had an opening for thirty analog engineers and then all of a sudden the ceo job at national which invented the analog industry comes open and it was a no brainer that  that analog had come to life again even though the magic of digital killed it for a couple decades luckily nobody told national so we retained about seven hundred in the best and brightest analog engineers on the face of the earth and now were turning in the results   rw well how about the group that left and founded linear theyve done well   bh theyve done extremely well and maxim as well and the other one is adi which started out in the east coast all analog companies all doing extremely well its a relatively low capital business you dont need stateoftheart fabs you know rob if you think back on the nature of this business im sure youve heard gordon moore in his speeches say �this is the only industry that has made the price performance gains that weve made moores law etc  that if any other industry was as responsive to price performance gains and innovation today you could buy a rolls royce for a quarter drive it downtown and throw it away� that would be the equivalent price performance improvements and if you think about it  if you think about in the history of our industry we have had this huge capital expense to build a fab whether  whatever generation it is  as you know  millimeter fabs now are upwards of two billion dollars so the corresponding message that goes to the field sales force is the little tiny things that come out of that fab have got to fill up the fab so the mantra fill the fab in fact at intel there was a period of time where even intel which now is one of the only companies  one of the few companies that can get paid for what they do  their mantra used to be fill the f�ing fab ftff and gordon moore in all of his class changed that to fill the facilitized fab and even intel was driven by the need to fill the fab and so when youre in that position and the customers got multiple choices there is no such thing as value pricing and in the analog business and the companies that we just mentioned maxim ltc adi and national semiconductor you dont need to fill the fabs i mean the fabs are fully depreciated for the most part its a matter of putting into those fabs products with the right margins right asps and you know thats a matter of product definition and education of the sales force and the customer and its a much better business   rw yeah or putting it in another way its not such a crazy business as the digital world i wonder if  for example at lsi logic and whether we had positive retained earnings over our lifetime ive never gone back and looked at the numbers   bh yeah i think a couple of the companies were pretty close you know the thing about digital  if you think about this  analog  i mean bob widlar invented the industry back in  thirtyfive years ago or something but this digital thing all came about as the magic of intel and magic of the microprocessor and the pc and so for two whole decades the universities all shut down any of their analog curriculum only georgia tech kept an analog curriculum alive all the others shut it down in fact national donated about a three million dollar lab to berkeley many many years ago and its got a beautiful plaque outside that says the national semiconductor analog fab or analog lab  for the first two years they taught a digital course in that lab so what happens is that theres no synopsis equivalent synthesis theres no cadence floor planning equivalent theres no cad tools that help the designers and so analog design is still considered a black art so it goes around in the minds of the people  the design engineers and that is incredibly valuable and takes a lot of the craziness out of the business in digital quite frankly when youve got all these tools and youve got all of these graduates still coming out of the universities that want to be digital designers you know they come out theyre small fish in a giant pond and with analog theres still a limitation on the number of overall engineers shared by those four companies and then to a lesser extent by companies like texas instrument   rw well the of course theres the japanese companies and they do a lot of consumer work in analog   bh yeah the japanese  the japanese are best serving as a role model for the chinese because they took such a good run at the industry and you know i came to the sia in this job the semiconductor industry association as this brash young guy that you know was sure i could do it better than the forefathers the founders of this industry and the first thing i found out is that these guys were all heroes charlie sporck and gordon moore and wilf corrigan that what they did visàvis the japanese was truly heroic in stopping them and forcing the antidumping laws the  trade legislation i had a role to play in that as well i was at intel at the time and had been a sales training for hamiltonavnet it was called in those days and somehow one of the sales guys got a foil from hitachi and the foil said dont stop bidding until youve won the business if intel undercuts you go ten percent below them if they undercut you again go another ten percent and it was written  that foil was done by a guy that used to work for me at intel and i recognized it right away and so i was the go between i passed it onto the executives and they decided that  that this was very serious and that kind of led to all the dumping thing but the fight that the founders of the semiconductor industry association put up at that time twentyfive years ago was truly truly heroic   rw which in many other industries we didnt do  television    bh television and the automobile and you know that was  that was really the  the kind of vision is if you want to have happen to the semiconductor industry what happened to the television industry you know dont support us now having said that rob heres where we are today the chinese have learned from the best and the worst of all of these wouldbe wanttobe countries that  that want to get what the united states has japan was the first korea  taiwan followed whats the difference the difference is japan is a very tiny set of islands they ran out of people very quickly their cost of wages very quickly exceeded the united states  so they were no longer the low cost manufacturing entity and you know theres other things that china has learned from the success of our industry here in the united states  one of those things rob is stock options they know they work stock options created this industry along with the other  the other kinds of things that we did to  to get the industry going so in china  the stock option is very lucrative strike prices at par value and no capital gains tax on exercise and what are we doing here in this country were eliminating stock options you know stock option expensing is just a fancy french word which means eradication over time and you know the other thing that the chinese have learned is the importance of education of these undergraduate engineers so they would send them and  in shiploads over to stanford and berkeley and mit to get the best education on the face of the earth and now in our infinite wisdom were sending them home �visa denied� you know with the capital and hb visas and i always  i always say  andy grove was always kind of a hero of mine  working for him for fourteen years and a true mentor and if you think about it andy came over here as an immigrant  was a refugee got himself into the position with a lot of hard work and intel over the years has probably  and by the way i always say that andy could have been equally successful in the screen door business but over the years he took that company to the point of creation of the microprocessor and the pc business pc business got us the internet the internet got us the search engines and the buying engines and how many hundreds of thousands of jobs have been created by a guy andy grove who today wed say go home andy �visa denied� and you know thats just another one thats  so the sia today our primary role is to spend a lot of time in washington and try to convince our politicians that we run the risk of losing the technology lead and i call it a perfect storm of technology neglect its not only hb visas stock options  its substantially reduced funding of the national science foundation darpa now has an eighteen month time horizon where they need to get payback and so they put less and less of their money in the university system and more and more into the raytheons and lockheeds of the world where they can get a payback this little entity that got us the transistor back in  that noyce and grove and moore    rw bell labs   bh bell labs you know very unsuccessful entity right one out of twenty projects is successful but what were they the laser and the transistor surround sound unix i mean you name it and its been incredibly important well bell labs had a source of funding from the telephone calls of att at  i think penny per call or something that was such a gift to the rest of the world well bell labs now is a tiny fraction of itself and so is stanford research and so is xerox parc and so the basic research now has to come out of the universities and that means additional funding from the united states government one time in the history of our country that nobody remembers anymore except a few of us  where there was no question in anybodys mind that we had fallen behind in the technology race and that was when sputnik went up and you know there i was in fort dodge  iowa  the whole family came out and all the neighbors were out and we had a blanket on the front lawn and a bowl of popcorn and up in bottles in those days and you know you could hear the tittering conversation up and down the streets and one lady says there it goes and somebody else says no thats just a shooting star and  and you could smell the cigar smoke from the guy across the street anyway then sputnik went over and it was like the whole block went quiet because if you recall in those days certainly not in my neighborhood but in some backyards in fort dodge iowa people had bomb shelters because of the cold war and here was a satellite going overhead with a payload big enough to carry a missile right over the top of our houses so eisenhower had no problem throwing a billion dollars which was a lot of money in  at the space race and he also created the national defense education act to spur interest in math and science sound familiar doesnt it well the space race caused the mainframe race so mainframes had to get faster and faster that got them hotter and hotter and noyce and grove and moore used that transistor to create the dram to replace the ferrite core magnets in the back of mainframes that created the semiconductor industry and meanwhile darpa took all these mainframes now and tried to wire them together and that with the help of the university of illinois and mosaic became the internet and google and ebay and yahoo and the dot com companies that are now becoming very successful and so it was that important realizing we were behind in those days it was that important for the government to step in and fund some spending in that area and look at the payback we got as a nation were there again were on the verge of losing this technology lead and because of this perfect storm of technology neglect   rw yeah well silicon valley has been a place of innovation for a long time what do you attribute that success to   bh well certainly these founding industries  i mean you start with hewlettpackard right and this whole garage shop approach to changing the world and you know the  the energy that intel had but underlying all that and its incredibly important not to forget the importance of venture capital in really getting us going and now weve become silicon valley  what i would call and i heard bill gates use this term were the iq magnet of the world still the really smart people want to be here this is where its going to happen this is where the chances are best that youre going to surround yourself with a whole bunch of other really smart high iq people and so i think weve still got that going for us and its one of the reasons by the way that when the best and the brightest do come from these other nations to get their shiny new degree or the phd that they stay here and so its vitally important that we let them stay here and that we do get rid of this cap on hb visas i think its the iq magnet of the world still   rw well i was born here so thats probably the only way i got in   bh yeah but i mean look how  look how many other states and countries have tried to duplicate this thing never coming close to whats happened here in the valley and its phenomenal   rw well i see youve got a few photographs and so on i wonder if we could go and take a look at those on your back wall and explain what those are   bh sure well inherited the chairmanship of the sia this year and you know my primary motivation for the year is that we not lose the technology lead on my watch thats why ive been spending time in washington doing what i consider to be one of the most distasteful things you can do which is spend your time with the politicians this is a picture of gordon moore who was absolutely one of the classiest guys in the industry and clearly responsible for so much of what we see around us and im holding up a fish here this was out on gordons boat we went out to the farallones dave house myself and a few of the other intel guys and so you know the boat was rocking and i went flying into dave house and he threw his pole and everything over the side and it was a four hundred dollar set of equipment gordon says no problem i got more downstairs and he goes down and on the way back gordon cleaned everybodys fish and then took everybodys picture with their fish and it was like the  the grandfather that everybody wished theyd a had is gordon moore just the coolest guy and classiest guy in the world so this is a favorite i thought  hey luann is there another nebraska one over there like with me and eric crouch the heisman trophy winner anyway this is frank solich who is the coach of university of nebraska  which is i still have season tickets and go back for one game a year this is another classy guy the governor of maine  angus king who was really responsible for keeping national semiconductor and for us putting fairchild back into maine  he was just incredibly tech savvy heres an interesting guy also a major supporter of the industry and shifted gears when he created the fabless semiconductor industry by putting up the first foundry and that was tsmc   rw morris chang   bh morris chang absolutely very vital to the industry hes kind of low keyed now i think hes retired from tsmc lets see what else do we have weve rung the bell several times at the new york stock exchange national semiconductors a new york stock exchange company heres a eightyear favorite of mine wilf corrigan another one of the tough guys founders of the industry and the semiconductor industry association and one of the guys that fought the hardest to keep this industry on our shores when the japanese wanted it the other way and then we have george bush this happens to be at an event when george bush was trying to solve the energy crisis for the united states  and at the time national was in the information appliance business and we were touting thin clients and so i was explaining to him how thin clients work and how it saves energy because you have all the energy spent somewhere where theres a server farm and you put the server farm next to a raging river where you can get cheap energy you dont have to have it here in silicon valley  this was  at this  at this event there was about five companies demonstrating around the room and he understood what i was talking about he went to the next booth and they did this thing and president bush goes whew right over my head he says just a second and he says bob and he calls for his  he says this is electric bob over here he says come on over electric bob and he turns to me he says his real names bill but i didnt want to yell electric bill here in california  anyway a lot of memories a lot of tough guys and i enjoy looking at these pictures i got another wall full of pictures over here and    rw well weve changed the world havent we i mean the world we live in now is different than the world when we were kids   bh absolutely and it  and its    rw mostly for the best   bh and its changing exponentially better now you know if you think back on the cycles of the industry the first one was that dram cycle where all the semiconductor companies there was only a handful of them threw everything they had at creating dram because that was the hot market right that was you know replacing all the ferrite core magnets in mainframes and of course we overbuilt and we went over the cliff and that was the first cycle the industry only got up to five billion sales out in those days but we thought that was a lot of money and then the pc boom back in the  in the late seventies early eighties all the semiconductor companies diverted all their capacity building pc kits and of course we overbuilt there too but we only got the industry then up to twentyfive billion we thought never get any higher boom next  the next downturn in the second cycle the third one was the connected pc boom now also with the cell phone and we got the industry up to two hundred and four billion dollars in sales out in that internet and cell phone and of course we overbuilt we overbuilt infrastructure chips and everything else now were on the upward slope of the cycle that followed the dot com boom bubble burst different this time all of those other cycles were caused by one killer application whether its mainframe dram pc kits the internet and the cell phone now if you look at whats driving the industry its pdas its mp players its digital tvs its pvrs its these things that show up under a christmas tree or driving demand for industry and guess what we now have the industry on a run rate basis at two hundred and fifty billion and we still havent seen the next killer app in the it space microsoft still hasnt released longhorn and yet somehow demand is going crazy its being driven by this wide diversity of two to four hundred dollar products so the question id ask is how do you stimulate the next downturn when there is no one obvious place to build a pile of inventory so id say it bodes pretty well for our industry and the future looks fairly bright   rw all right well thank you   bh thank you rob   national semiconductor ceo brian halla discusses role of electronics in worlds

search interviews brian halla ceo of national semiconductor published december   facebook twitter email print this is a partial transcript from your world with neil cavuto december   that was edited for clarity watch your world wcavuto weekdays at  pm and  am et neil cavuto host a chip off the old block for tech giant national semiconductor which beat street estimates thursday the company posted an eight percent increase from its first quarter due to strong sales less expenses with us now from california brian halla the national semiconductor chairman and ceo brian good to have you brian halla ceo national semiconductor nsm is that neil cavuto yes it is halla i can hear you just fine cavuto all right apologize for that before we were talking about your better than expected numbers we’re also talking on a day intel was forecasting better than expected revenue for this quarter it seems like you tech guys are back partying are you halla hey i’ll tell you what it feels great it’s going to be a very merry christmas we started our recovery back at the first of the year back in february when we disposed of a couple digital businesses and we said hey we’re going to create our own recovery at the bottom line regardless of what happens to the economy and then about three quarters ago we saw a sharp an uptick in consumption of consumer products in japan and then asia after sars and i’ll tell you what now if we have an it recovery it’s icing on the cake for us we’re an analogue company and the analogue business is booming cavuto who is buying from you right now halla we sell to all the large handset suppliers we sell analogue circuits for flat panel displays our partner there is samson the big consumers are all the usual suspects in the display business and we have seen a tremendous pickup of activity in notebook computers particularly the builders in taiwan cavuto let me get your sense of where you see this going you know there a lot of people who love your industry brian who are saying they’re just afraid it has gotten ahead of yourself including in your case your stock what do you say halla well am i supposed to feel bad about that cavuto good point halla last earnings call i was sitting here and at the end of the earnings call we closed at  a share and today we’re at  and so that is not a tear coming out of my eye cavuto all right but do you think it can last halla oh yes absolutely you know it is like everything everything is eventually going to a semiconductor level and right now and particularly in the analogue business virtually everything is using more and more analogue circuitry sight sound touch and feel all of that stuff is analogue cavuto all right we’ll see what happens brian halla thank you very much national semiconductor’s

mon   am comments by national semiconductor’s wwwnationalcom ceo brian halla spoke today at a press conference on the eve of electronica  in munich about the future of technology and national semiconductor’s role in it he spoke about the power of convergence the importance of analog and the next big thing  brian pointed out that analog is not only where the real world lives it is also immune from moore’s law in that circuit size and density is not a factor in analog performance in addition the intense pressure for lowpower circuits and energyefficient operation can be addressed very effectively in the analog realm the challenges lie in system integration and education to adopt and apply the latest in analog signal and power management technologies and integrate them properly with the digital side of the house national semiconductor’s powerwise technology family is focused on the concept of “analog to information” where the entire processing chain is moved to the analog domain the example brain gave was their lmv audio chip which uses analog farfield noise suppression in real time to perform the same noise reduction as a digital circuit but with only  of the power consumption httpwwwnationalcompflmlmvhtml brian stated that the current trend is towards more integrated systems that improve the quality of life in areas such as alternate energy health care safety and productivity the explosion of technology has followed a rollercoaster curve with every new application area creating both new growth and a subsequent bust followed by consolidation of the disruptive technologies involved this is then followed in turn by the development of the next generation of new technologies which causes the cycle to repeat according to him we are poised at the beginning of a new cycle based in consumerdriven applications integrating all the precious technological advances       from the ’s to the ’s the dominant meme was man talking to a machine in the ’s began the trend of man talking to  machines then more and more and more now we are at the point where machines talk to machines in the service of man ubiquitous computing driven by portable electronics and integrated devices such as smart phones will be the face of the future one major area of development is in solar power which is plagued by poor performance due to solar shading even if only one panel of a solar array is in shade the entire assembly can fall in power output by as much as  or more since solar panels are connected in serial strings a solar array suffers from the same problem that a cell flashlight with one bad battery does when one of them is in the shade national semiconductor has recently released a product to directly address this need the solarmagic module this device can isolate a bad panel from the rest and feed its reduced output into the system without affecting neighboring panels increasing overall efficiency of the array by as much as  this technology can also be used in multiplebattery arrays in the exact same way isolating bad cells while still allowing them to contribute to the system’s total power output the next step may be integrating the electric car and the smart house in an energymanagement system that uses the vehicle battery for storage this is still a ways in the future as it will rely on battery “supercharging” technology to charge a battery in a very short time relevant product sample data logger the co sampling data logger allows you to accurately read and log co levels from a controlled environment over
