pay the obligation the level of competition in the horse breeding business is extremely high we need proceeds from this offering to enter this business we also need knowledge riding and competition experience and broad connections to enter into the horse breeding business we will be in a market where we compete with many domestic and international companies offering similar services we will be in direct competition with them many of these companies may have a greater more established customer base than us we will likely lose business to such companies also many of these companies will be able to afford to offer young horses with better characteristics than us which may also cause us to lose business we foresee to continue to face challenges from new market entrants we may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations albero corp has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to date once we have entered the market we will be one of many participants in the horse breeding business many established yet well financed entities are currently active in the horse industry nearly all albero corps competitors have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than albero corp we are consequently at a competitive disadvantage in being able to provide such services and become a successful company in the equine industry therefore albero corp may not be able to establish itself within the industry at all company description we plan to commence operations in the horse breeding business we are planning to purchase brood mares that demonstrated good results at show jumping competitions or triathlons whose jumps on racecourses were no less than  meters we will purchase brood mares with good breeding record that includes famous world producers whose offspring already demonstrates good results in largescale competitions the price for high category young brood mares starts from  and can be much higher depending on their characteristics we do not intend to buy such high category young horses we need funds from this offering to buy our mares if we have available funds we plan to purchase up to  houses we plan also to buy old mares  years old and older the price for such horses starts from  as of today we have purchased one old mare for  its breeding record is seven foals for the last seven years its breed is irish sport horse and its age is  year old as of today we have also leased a pasture consisting of approximately  acres located at  ballylummin rd ahoghill ballymena co antrim bt ph northern ireland for mating we will use the world best studhorses that competed and compete in largescale world competitions and that already have offspring that already competes and takes high places in international competitions further the company will handle stockbreeding – raising elite offspring for sport purposes we will purchase a semen and inoculate it into our brood mares for mating we will take our horses to breeding farms we plan to lease grazing land where our horses will live we will keep foals until they are  months old and then sell them by auction the foals are sold for at least  or higher depending on their breeding record exterior data as well as their movement the price can reach  thousands and higher the amount of time that we expect to elapse between identification and purchase of a brood mare and sale of a viable foal is  years
