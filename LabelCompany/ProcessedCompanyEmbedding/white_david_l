network infrastructure we propose a new object identification scheme the electronic product code epc which uniquely identifiesobjectsand facilitatestracking throughout the product life cycle the epc is a short simple and extensible code designed for efficient referencing to networked information  introduction our vision is to create a smart world that is an intelligent infrastructure linking objects information and people through the computer network this new infrastructure will allow universal coordination of physical resources through remote monitoring and control by humans and machines our objective is to create open standards protocols and languages to facilitate worldwide adoption of this network forming the basis for a new internet of things this paper describes one of the first activities in the creation of this new network infrastructure that is the design of a naming scheme to enumerate and identify physical objects termed the electronic product code epc this standard will serve not only as a next generation universal product code upc but also as a method to identifying components assemblies and systems in the formation of this standard we must carefully consider its purpose and scope as well as its practical application in commerce and industry we must also evaluate current product and shipment numbering standards as well as other schemes from other domains which have been successfully adopted  the intelligent infrastructure we envision an intelligent infrastructure which automatically and seamlessly links physical objects to the global internet this network will have a number of important characteristics first unlike conventional barcodes this system will network physical objects without human intervention or manipulation by automatic machines second the network will be seamless in other words it will operate continuously throughout the environment rather than just at the checkout or exit as with current scanning and electronic article surveillance eas systems third the network will be relatively inexpensive although it was technically possible to create such a network in the past new technologies make its practical implementation a reality fourth the network will be ubiquitous operating in many diverse environments from manufacturing plants and distribution centers to retail establishments and homes finally the network will adopt standards in cooperation with governing bodies such as the uniform code council ucc the european article number ean association the american national standards institute ansi and the international standards organization iso as well as commercial consortium and industry groups this intelligent infrastructure has four major components  electronic tags  electronic product code epc  physical markup language pml and  object name service ons we will briefly present these components and describe how the electronic product code is a key element in this vision mitautoidwh copyright   electronic tagging electronic tags refer to a family of technologies which transfer data wirelessly between tagged objects and electronic readers traditional bar codes may be considered electronic tags under this definition since the printed bars reflect light and communicate their data to the laser scanner electronic article surveillance eas labels also communicate information wirelessly but only a single bit of data whether or not an item has been purchased  radio frequency identification rfid tags often used in smart cards have small radio antennas which transmit information over a short range  rfid technology may use both powered and nonpowered means to activate the electronic tags powered devices use batteries to actively transmit data to more distant readers electronic highway toll systems are good examples of active rfid tags passive rfid devices typically use inductive coupling from an active reader to both power the tag and transmit the data electromagnetic identification emid technology is a more broad designation for wirelessly tagging systems the motorola bistatix tags for example use capacitive coupling to transmit data  both the reader and tag use simple conductive surfaces for the antenna since conductive surfaces can be printed fabrication costs are significantly reduced as compared to the inductive windings of the rfid tags future versions may cost a few cents making widespread adoption practical electronic tags when coupled to a reader network allow continuous tracking and identification of physical objects reader arrays have been fabricated and integrated in floor tiles carpeting shelf paper cabinets and appliances similar to cellular phone grids the reader network may provide seamless and continuous communication to tagged objects in order to access and identify these objects we need a means to uniquely name them electronic product code the electronic product code epc was conceived as a means to identify all physical objects the epc code must be sufficiently large to enumerate all objects and to accommodate all current and future naming methods it should provide for industry coding standards such as those from the uniform code council ucc and the european article numbering ean international these standards include original the uniform product code upc as well as other numbering schemes such as the shipping container code scc and the serial shipping container code sscc the epc should as much as possible be universally and globally accepted since the epc is used primarily to link physical objects to the network it should serve as an efficient information reference finally the code should be extensible allowing future expansion in both size and design product markup language the electronic product code serves as a reference to information on the computer network there are of course many methods for storing information online these include properitary and commercial databases and relational databases such as structured query language sql file systems web pages written in the hypertext markup language html are now one of the most common means of storing digital information new approaches such the extensible markup language xml promise a universal means for structured information mitautoidwh copyright  in order to describe physical objects we propose a new language specific for that purpose the physical markup language pml rather than a new syntax the pml will be based on the extensible markup language and include a set of schema describing common aspects of physical objects industry specific representations could then be plugged into the common framework or derived from the shared data object name service the object name service ons is the glue which links the electronic product code epc with its associated physical markup language pml data file more specifically the ons is an automated networking service which when given an epc number returns a host address on which the corresponding pml file is located the ons currently under development is based on the standard domain naming service dns when complete the ons will be efficient and scaleable designed to handle the billions of transactions which are expected  identification codes to properly develop a new coding standard it is important to examine current methods not only in the same domain but in other areas which have been successfully deployed in this section we will briefly consider various identification schemes including the uniform code council ucc and european article numbering ean international standards as well as numbering systems from other areas such as vehicle numbers addresses and telephone numbers there are common and successful methods in their design which we will want to adopt the universal product code upc the universal product code upc is perhaps one of the most successful standards ever developed it has for years sped transactions in retail stores shopping malls and supermarkets the uniform code council ucc upc code numbering system is a  digit numeric sequence the standard symbol which represents the upc code is a series of light and dark lines together with a human readable numeric equivalent as shown in figure  figure  the universal product code upc is a numeric sequence representing manufacturer and product the universal product code numbering system character manufacturer id number item number modulo check character mitautoidwh copyright  the upc numeric code which is distinct from its bar code symbol representation consists of four partitions  the first partition consists of a single digit indicating the numbering system used to interpret the remaining characters a  for example designates a regular upc code a  a national drug code and a  a coupon the next five digits designate the manufacture identification number and the following five the item number item numbering is maintained by the associated manufacture that must ensure unique numbers for each product type finally a single digit is added as a check character used to validate the correct interpretation of the machine scan the upc code can therefore provide up to  unique numbering systems  manufacturer identifiers and  product types for each manufacturer in addition to the standard symbol shown in figure  there is a zerosuppression version for smaller bar codes used on bottles and cans  there is also a european variant the uccean administered by the european article number numbering association ean supply chain identification in addition to the item numbering standards outlined above the uniform code council and the european article numbering association have developed many other numbering standards for supply chain tracking and identification  these include numbering standards for books magazines greeting cards audiovideo products and drugs there are also numbering standards for packaging and containers these coding methods have various configurations lengths partitions and bar code symbols in addition to product identification many of these coding standards have descriptive information these include information on currency price weight volume expiration date etc in fact a variation the uccean application identifiers ai was developed specifically to carry information about items and shipments  the need to carry greater information about a product and the desire to track a wider variety of item has lead to a great disparity in numbering methods furthermore the inherent limitations of linear bar codes have lead to other approaches such as twodimensional barcodes and embedded electronic memory in fact it is the recognition of these needs and an acknowledgement of pervasive networking which lead to the approach presented here other numbering schemes license plate numbers automobile license plates are typically composed of a series of letters and numbers in the united states license numbers are issued and administered by each state and generally composed of six or fewer characters perhaps more than any other scheme license numbers must be easily read and remembered after only a brief encounter for this reason they are typically grouped into one or two partitions consisting of three or four alphanumeric characters a typical license number composed of six characters allows a maximum address space of   or approximately  billion numbers clearly this exceeds the number of operating vehicles in any one state or province mitautoidwh copyright  this calculation however over estimates the usable namespace since more restrictive numbering partitions are currently adopted such as three letters and three numbers or four numbers and two letters etc we can assume though that these partitions could be changed should the need arise vehicle identification numbers vehicle identification numbers vin first appeared on american automobiles in the vin was intended to identify the vehicle and provide a condensed description see figure  early vin numbers came in a variety of formats and configurations the only way to interpret these numbers was through a vin decoder in  the us national highway traffic safety administration required all overtheroad vehicles to contain a standard character vin in later years in an effort to prevent theft the department of transportation required vin numbers to marked on major components  figure  the vehicle identification numbers vin identify vehicles and provide a condensed vehicle description vehicle identification numbers fillin digit or us code fillin digit or us code production plant body or engine type j h m e d m s world manufacturer code st  nd digit of model code model year  rd digit of model type sequential identity number social security numbers in  the us established a permanent national pension system financed through contributions by both the employee and employer as a means of identifying the beneficiaries unique social security numbers were issued in the united states these social security numbers ssn also serve as a common means of personal identification from driver s licenses to voter registration to medical records the social security number is a simple digit number divided into three sections of three two and four digits as shown in figure   the ssn can therefore provide only a total of  billion unique identifiers certainly enough for the us population but insufficient if applied globally figure  the social security numbers are used in the united states for personal identification social security numbers group number area number geographic region serial number mitautoidwh copyright  isbn numbers the international standard book number isbn system was established in  as a standard means for identifying books and publications the isbn numbering scheme has three data partitions comprising the country of origin publisher and title and edition  the isbn number is an example of a variable partition scheme the publisher and title share  digits with  to  digits for the publisher and the remainder for the title as illustrated in figure  in this way the fewer publishers with many volumes have more title numbers available while the many publishers with few titles have a smaller allotment figure  the international standard book number isbn uniquely identifies the publication international standard book number publisher code check digit country code title and edition address codes while address codes do not correspond to any particular item they do define a geographic region and in some sense may be considered a type of object code in  president kennedy appointed an advisory board of the united states post office department to study the mechanics of mail movement and to develop recommendations for its improvement one of the prime objectives was the development of a coding system which had been under consideration for many years in  the department finalized the code and on april   postmaster general john a gronouski announced the zip zoning improvement plan code the fivedigit code zip code was assigned to every address in the united states  the first digit represented broad geographic areas from zero in the northeast to nine in the far west the following two digits were related to population concentrations or regions accessible to common transportation the final two digits designated post offices or postal zones in larger cities figure  the zip   code appends four digits to the traditional zip code zip code population regions delivery sector broad geographic region post office delivery segment mitautoidwh copyright  in  the zip code was introduced which added a four digit number following the traditional zip code as shown in figure  the sixth and seventh numbers of the new code denote a delivery sector which may be several blocks a group of streets a group of post office boxes several office buildings a single highrise office building a large apartment building or a small geographic area the last two numbers denote a delivery segment which might be one floor of an office building one side of a street between intersecting streets specific departments in a firm or a group of post office boxes telephone numbers as with the other numbering schemes the telephone number format varies throughout the world in the united states the telephone number partitions correspond to network regions subregions and individual extensions as shown in figure   international telephone numbers follow this pattern though many have variable partition schemes allowing some regions to have a greater number of possible numbers in addition the country code varies from  to  digits telephone numbers in particular require small partitions of few numbers to allow simple recall in fact the number of partitions and the number of characters in each partition are closely related to the capacity of human shortterm memory any new number system requiring memory and recall must follow this same pattern figure  telephone numbers in the united states have fixed partitions which correspond to network regions subregions and individual extensions telephone numbers area code extension country code exchange internet address the internet address is perhaps one of the latest encoding schemes  the internet address or ip address is a globally accepted method for identifying computers attached to the internet the address is a standardized compact binary address that makes computations like routing decisions efficient specifically an ip address encodes the identification of the network to which a host attaches as well as the identification of a unique host on that network each host on a tcpip internet is assigned a unique bit internet address that is used in all communication with that host each address consists of a header and a pair netid hostid where netid identifies the network and hostid identifies a host on that network the header varies in length from  to  bits the header indicates the structure and partitions of the remaining bits a class a address for example is indicated by a  in a bit header and divides the remaining address into  bits for the netid and  bits for the hostid this provides a total address space of   or  networks and   and  hosts a class b address shown in figure  is used for intermediate sized networks allowing   or  networks and   or  hosts for readability ip addresses are typically reduced to a four decimal integers separated by dots as shown in figure  mitautoidwh copyright  figure  the internet address or ip address is a bit number which uniquely identifies a networked computer host the first two bits for a class b address shown here define the remaining partitions for the netid and hostid ip address header net id host id summary the examples given above illustrate the range and application of various coding methods it is by no means an exhaustive list nor greatly detailed the discussion however shows common approaches and general directions which we will use in designing the new epc standard it may even be possible to accommodate some of these standards under the common framework of the epc code  design the objective of the electronic product code epc is to provide unique identification of physical objects the epc will be used to address and access individual objects from the computer network much as the internet protocol ip address allows computers to identify organize and communicate with one another in the following sections we will consider various aspects of an object numbering scheme and describe strategies used to design the epc unique identification unlike the current uniform product code upc the electronic product code is intended to uniquely identify physical objects in other words a unique epc will be assigned to one and only one physical item there are some immediate consequences to this decision first there must be a sufficient number epc codes to accommodate past current and future needs in object identification such an objective leads to the consideration of the number of all physical objects consider items listed in table  from the population of the world six billion to the total number of grains of rice roughly ten million billion we see the epc must have a sufficiently large address space to reference all these objects table  unique physical objects number into the quadrillions  bits unique number objects   per annum automobiles   in use computers   total humans   per annum razor blades   per annum grains of rice mitautoidwh copyright  second there must be some means to ensure uniqueness in epc number assignment as well as a way to resolve conflict should identical numbers be created this also leads to the issue of who or what organization should be responsible for unique epc assignment as with the current upc approach the answer may lie in distributed responsibility in other words multiple managers administrate a portion of the epc namespace assigned to them in addition to organizational and legislative management automated software tools may aid in the creation and resolution of the epc namespace finally there is the issue of longevity and recycling of epc numbers given that some organizations must track products indefinitely coupled with the growing capability of the tagging electronics there may be no need or desire to reuse epc assignments at least in the foreseeable future we will consider unique identification permanently associated with particular items manufacturers and products the uniform code council has nearly one million member companies most of these companies are larger organizations with products that require upc codes when we consider smaller companies service organizations and private enterprises we have a much larger number in fact current estimates of the number of companies worldwide exceed  million this number is expected to grow to over  million in the next  years  clearly we must construct a standard numbering system consistent with these projections every company manages a set of products and services one issue to consider is how many different types of products a company manages most companies have relatively few products though some especially in the apparel industry have as many as  different products again this represents a product class or as termed in the retail industry a skew number or stock keeping unit sku the range of product numbers varies greatly as shown in table  it is interesting to note in this survey of ean member companies there are no organizations with different product types numbering over  furthermore when we consider many smaller companies who are not members of any standards bodies this number will be even less table  the range of product numbers varies greatly from a few dozen to over  as represented in an ean survey domain median range emerging market economies  emerging industrial economies  advanced industrial countries   containers traditionally items containers and pallets received different numbering structures such as the shipping container codes and serial shipping container codes as mentioned in the preceding section in the architecture we propose there is no reason these containment objects receive a different code than the epc the record of items within the container as well as the shipping data commonly associated with the traditional codes may be stored on the computer network and automatically associated with the container even further the truck in which the containers are transported as well as the boxcar ship or warehouse may also received the same epc format as the individual product an epc hierarchy as illustrated in figure  will represent the state of an item shipment this hierarchy will shift and change over time mitautoidwh copyright  figure  elements in a shipment form a hierarchy composed of a transport vehicle pallets containers and items shipment hierarchy epc epc ec epc c b epc c a epc c epc f f epc bf epc bf epc bf epc f d thus by recording the epc containment structure along with transition times a partial history of product shipment can be logged the shipment records however are not complete without location information it is clear shipping data will need to include the position of the item within a container as well as its location along a route along these lines we are developing an extension to the electronic product code which will describe item location within a container whether that container is as pallet or a warehouse assemblies aggregates and collections in addition to individual objects the electronic product code epc may also identify object assemblies aggregates and collections an automobile for example is a discrete object but is composed of numerous subassemblies and components we propose to use epcs to designate assemblies and subassemblies as well as individual items in this case we can describe an assembly in the same manner as the shipping data from the previous section in fact there is no substantive difference between a container and an assembly traditionally assemblies are thought of as more complex with linkages between components in any case the mitautoidwh copyright  topological arrangement of containers and assemblies can be represented in the same hierarchical graph structure shown in figure  beyond assemblies and containers there are many aggregates or collections of objects that while having no physical connection are associated with each other nonetheless a dinner place setting for example is one unit composed of disparate items having no physical connection these collections however may be assigned a unique electronic product code furthermore the same objects may be reorganized to form new collections each with different epc codes it is clear from the preceding discussion that the total number of electronic product codes may in fact exceed the number of physical items this discussion also emphasizes the need to provide a system to prevent redundant encoding embedded information one of the major issues and an area of continued debate is whether to embed information in the electronic product code current encoding standards such as the uccean application identifiers ai have data within their structure this information for example may include item weight size expiration date destination etc we propose to eliminate or minimize the amount of information directly encoded within the epc the fundamental idea is to use the existing computer network and current information resources to store data the epc would then be an information reference this desire to minimize information however must be balanced against pragmatic concerns such as ease of use simplicity and compatibility with legacy systems whether or not information is stored in the epc we would certainly want to identify the object along these lines we define the electronic product code to be that portion of an encoding scheme which uniquely identifiesan item therefore in the propose design we will focus on those data elements needed to identify objects categorization categorization that is the classification or grouping of objects with common characteristics is one of the fundamental abilities of intelligent systems and the primary means of reducing data complexity developing an effective taxonomy is a difficult task since it depends intrinsically on the viewpoint of the observer for example a manufacturer may classify a case of paint as an inventory asset a shipper as a stackable container and a recycler as toxic waste in every case classification is the activity of grouping items with characteristics common to a particular viewpoint and not an intrinsic feature of the object therefore we propose to eliminate or minimize classification information in the electronic product code since classification is still an important activity we propose to move this function to the network more specifically we propose higherlevel software will operate on the fundamental data descriptions and filter objects into classification groups mitautoidwh copyright   information reference the primary function of the electronic product code is to serve as a reference to networked information in other words the epc is essentially a pointer to online data a common reference in use on the internet is the uniform resource identifier uri which includes the older uniform resource locators url and the uniform resource names urn these identifiers are translated by the domain naming service dns into associated internet protocol ip addresses at whose location networked information resides in the same way we propose an object name service ons which will translate epc codes directly into ip addresses the hosts identified by the ip address then store relevant information about the product the ons is essentially the glue between the epc code and networked information the structure of the code should therefore facilitate the lookup of host addresses and maximize the search efficiency through this object yellow pages metadata by metadata we mean information within the epc which encodes the type and structure of subsequent data since metadata does not add to the object identification process nor to embedded information it should be minimized as much as possible the tradeoff however is ability to identify internal structure and to provide for future unforeseen code requirements essentially metadata is the version number of the epc code embedded into its structure we must at a minimum provide some ability to upgrade the code structure as requirements change simplicity there have been many standards and naming schemes devised in the past but few see widespread adoption one of the impediments to acceptance is complexity more difficult schemes require longer learning times and must be balanced by greater benefit to the user it is our desire to create an electronic product code which is as simple as possible yet still provides for object identification along these lines it would be helpful though not necessary for the epc to be immediately and intuitively obvious to the human user human interaction beyond simplicity many coding systems are designed specifically for human interaction given our limited shortterm memory typically seven or fewer items many codes particularly license plate and telephone numbers contain few partitions with few numbers these codes are design specifically for instant recognition and simple recollection other codes for example ip addresses are intended for machine use but include representations for human readability though not intended for memory the dotted representation of the ip address can be written down and easily typed in manually in the design of the epc code direct human interaction is less important readability as with the current upc code and ip address will be necessary but human recollection will not be required therefore the epc code should have a simple and consistent representation which can easily be transcribed dictated and keyed manually mitautoidwh copyright   extensibility one of the difficulties in developing a global standard is anticipating all possible uses and future applications without perfect vision into the future we must provide a simple method for expansion thus rather than a complete specification we propose an initial design leaving the majority of the epc address space open for future definition media physically the epc will be stored on some type of physical media such as a barcode electronic memory or printed character the data will be transmitted via temporal or spatially encoded electromagnetic radiation in other words a laser scanner or radio antenna for almost all media the cost of storage and transmission raises with the amount of data since we desire the epc to be a pervasive code with perhaps trillions of tagged items the media must be as inexpensive as possible for this reason the epc should be of absolute minimum size to limit cost and complexity data transmission mechanisms the uniform product code has as part of its definition a checksum digit used to validate the transmission of digits from the printed label to the scanner check digits start and stop bits and handshaking protocol are all devices used to aid in the reliable transmission of information these mechanisms vary depending on the method of data transmission and the level of reliability rather than embedding data transmission mechanisms into the electronic product code we propose to decouple the code from any communications protocol all of these techniques will of course be used in the transmission of the epc data but will not be part its definition in this way we separate object identification strategies from data transmission methods privacy and security in the same way we separate content from transmission method we propose to decouple the epc definition from any security and cryptographic technique privacy and security are perhaps one of the primary issues in effective deployment of this networked infrastructure secure epc transmission storage and archive are vitally important for wide spread adoption however rather than impose any particular cryptographic method we propose to leave electronic product code simply as a method for naming and identifying objects all privacy and security systems would be layered on this basic identification system mitautoidwh copyright   proposal given the design considerations discussed in the previous section we must now finalize the structure of the electronic product code in the following sections we will decide on a the metadata that is the portion of the code which describes the code itself b the size of the code that is the number of digits characters or bits the code will contain and c the number nature and size of the code partitions metadata although somewhat abstract we must first decide on the size and nature of the metadata this is the portion of the code which describes the structure of the code the metadata or header may define overall size of the code number and size of the partitions meaning of each partition and any other structural information of the schema although metadata is useful for providing extensibility it limits information content for a given code size since the epc will be a pervasive lightweight code we naturally want to limit the size of the metadata and rely on external standards to convey this information at the same time given the ambition of the epc to include not only traditional uccean codes but other coding standards we will want a high degree of extensibility size the number of bits in the epc determines the theoretical upper bound on the number of identifiable objects this upper bound is of course given by n   n where n is the total address space and n is the number of bits in the code relatively few bits should be necessary to provide unique object identity a bit code for example provides for   addressable objects partitions in the epc reduce the practical address space since underutilized segments produce gaps in subsequent sections for example assuming a uniform utilization rate within each partition the total address space is n  f   n xf   n x xf m  nm where f  is the utilization rate n i is the number of bits for partition i and m is the number of partitions suppose a uniform  utilization for each of four identical partitions on a bit code the total address space is   a  times reduction in address space for uniform utilization over uniform partitions the reduction in address space is r f m address space is thus reduced exponentially in the number of partitions and therefore the partition count should be minimized mitautoidwh copyright  it is likely partition utilization will be much less than the  used in this illustration for example the differences between items produced between manufactures vary by many orders of magnitude from a single product to many billions efficient utilization would argue strongly for a variable partition method on the other hand simplicity of design favors fixed partitions partitions generally partitions reduce address space yet greatly increase the efficiency of searching through that address space suppose we have a catalog or cross reference of epc and networked information references such as uniform resource locators urls the size of any given catalog is given by c  ni where c is the catalog size and ni is the number of bits for each partition i from the previous illustration for a bit uniform partition this catalog size is    entries certainly within the capacity of conventional storage systems assuming a catalog search is proportional to its size seek time reduces exponentially with partition count partition design and catalog maintenance will also be determined by political influences it is most likely catalogs will be managed by those who are oversee particular object sets such as manufactures of products facility managers and government organizations epc schema given the above considerations we present a simple scheme for the electronic product code we propose a bit code with a fixed bit header this header defines the number type and length of all subsequent data partitions thus a single byte provides  ways to partition the remaining bits rather than defining all possible epc configurations we propose only one primary type and reserve all others for future use epc type i the first epc configuration epc type i is intended as a public object identifying number it is to be used in much the same way the uniform product code is used today the intention is to function not only as the uccean item codes but also as the shipping identification methods such as the shipping container code scc serial shipping container code sscc and the application identifiers ai together with the networked information infrastructure the code can also consolidate many of the other standards in use today the epc type i has three data partitions shown in figure  the first data partition identifies the epc manager that is the manufacturer or entity responsible for maintaining the subsequent codes in other words it is the epc manager s responsibility to maintain both object type codes and serial numbers in their domain the epc manager must also ensure reliable operation of the object name service and for maintaining and publishing associate product documents mitautoidwh copyright  figure  the epc type  encoding is public object identifying number similar to the standard upc used today electronic product code a f dc header   bits epc manager   bits object class bits serial number bits the epc manager partition spans a bit section encoding a maximum of     or approximately  million manufacturers this far exceeds the current allocation provided by the upc and ean it is likely as with the current upc codes this allocation may eventually be insufficient this is precisely why the epc code is extensible a repartitioning of the code may be necessary to accommodate perhaps billions of managers who may oversee only hundreds of items this may be necessary in the near future if many small entities or individuals use the epc infrastructure to manage private internal physical resources the next partition object class will occupy the next bits the object class may be considered the product skew or stock keeping unit sku it may also be used for lot number or any other objectgrouping scheme developed by the epc manager since each manufacturer is allowed more than  million object types this partition could encode all the current upc skus as well as many other object classes this is important as we expand beyond current retail applications into general supply chain and manufacturing the final partition encodes a unique object identification number for all objects of a similar type the epc serial number provides bits or     unique identifiers together with the product code this provides each manufacturer with   unique item numbers currently beyond the range of all identified products  conclusion the universal product code has had phenomenal success and demonstrates the power of standardization and industry consensus together with the more recent success of the internet and the world wide web we are on the verge of yet another revolution in networking and supply chain efficiency the electronic product code presented in this paper is intended to provide a simple efficient and uniform naming system for physical objects the epc code spans the breadth of application from foods and drugs to assemblies and components this naming scheme also accommodates depth throughout the supply chain including vehicles pallets containers packages and items the electronic product code is only one piece of the new intelligent infrastructure together with the object name service and the physical markup language these elements form the foundation of the networked physical world
