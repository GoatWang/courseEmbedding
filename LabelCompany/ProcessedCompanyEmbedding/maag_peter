over to peter peter maag thanks caroline good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us weve had a busy few months here at caredx especially with the exciting progress on the allosure reimbursement fund jim gleason president of trio our patient organization dedicated to organ transplantation emphasized the transplant community looks forward to having the allosure test available to support those longterm posttransplant life benefits a great testimony to the immense patient need for better surveillance solutions for kidney transplantations also as you may have seen weve a new cfo on board its been great working with mike over this last month with his expertise in both finances and in diagnostics were working to streamline some of our financial procedures mike has also brought in some of his friends from deloitte to support our financial reporting team and to help and show we got every eye as we move ahead i’ll have mike go over our preliminary financial results but i would like to first update you on the recent development our strong revenue results this quarter reflect continuing growth of our flagship allomap test you recall that allomap is a highvalue diagnostic testing service that helps monitor heart transplant patients for the risk of rejection allomap revenues were in the range of  million to  million this quarter which reflect a volume increase of  compared to the first quarter of  we provided approximately  allomap patients results in the quarter so we are very pleased with our performance we continue to drive activities that increase the number of allomap per patient or the adherence to our surveillance protocol as discussed before many centers set their own protocols in adapting allomap in line with a standard follow up procedures we have gathered information through pilot studies in three centers that by supporting centers in organizing the allomap component of their surveillance protocol we have significantly increased their adherence we enrolled this program out to a total of  centers in the first half of this year but this program in full swing we will continue to drive allomap underlying volume growth with the efficiencies generated from this volume increase and the rose royalty payments ending after the third quarter the roughly  gross margin in allomap will help to support our path to profitability preliminary revenues for our pretransplant olerup business in the quarter were  million which reflect a good quarter as we have mentioned before our olerup product product offer the bestinclass hla typing solutions for transplant lab that are matching organs to recipients you can find olerup product in more than  of the roughly  hla labs around the world last september we launched olerup qtype to drive further growth in our pretransplant business reception to qtype continues to be very positive and we look forward to reporting back to you with a ce marking progress and validation of additional instruments so we have solid revenues in our preand posttransplant coproduct encompassing the continuum of care as we execute on our strategy to build the transplantation focus multiproduct genomic information company we are very excited to be adding to our portfolio allosure and we have had some recent great news allosure the first and only noninvasive test that uses donorderived cellfree dna to directly measure organ injury and identify the probability of active rejection allosure is not only bringing transformational sequencing technology to the clinic allosure is also a transformational product for caredx with three major scientific publications the relevant ipe through the indiscernible acquisition our bestinclass klf and the commercial platform through allomap in place we are extremely well positioned to execute on this opportunity last month we attained a draft local coverage determination lcd from palmetto no radian and other medicare administrative contractor mac for allosure the draft local coverage decision that issued following completion of the moldx the molecular diagnostic technical assessment process by palmetto cms has awarded palmetto with the administration of the molecular diagnostics program during the technical assessment process subject matter experts and the moldx team determined if an essay demonstrates clinical utility and fulfill the centers of medicare and medicaid services reasonable and necessary criteria for us medicare is so important that only because of the expertise of the team at moldx in regards to high value diagnostic tests evaluation but also because roughly  of all kidney transplantations are covered under medicare this means our reimbursement efforts for others who are highly targeted especially compared with other diagnostic tests that need to go through lengthy negotiations with multiple payers as we laid out on our last call there are three important phases of the moldx process the technical investment review the local coverage decision and reimbursement pricing setting we now have a draft lcd and were moving towards the reimbursement in price setting phase subsequent to a positive final lcd we will engage in pricing discussion we anticipate that we will have completed the reimbursement process in the second half of  and are planning for full launch of allosure in october this year we have shared with you previously that we continue to leverage our existing resources for product launch as  centers account for roughly  of the overall kidney transplant volume with a great overlap with our existing allomap offering we are planning for a very efficient launch on the clinical front we presented allosure data at the  american transplantation congress which was very well received by transplant physicians even more important for us where the many interactions that we had with investigators and key personnel from transplant centers who were eager to get their hands on the real life experience with allosure with that excitement on great data and reimbursement underway we feel very well positioned for the launch of allosure we are excited about allosures market opportunity and we believe allosure has the potential to achieve more than  million in revenue we hope to leverage our established expertise and commercial platform to make this a highly launch how do we get there i mentioned that transplant centers are highly concentrated group we will market allosure to the  kidney transplant centers in the us starting with centers where caredx hasnt established presence through allomap and the clinical trial presence through dart second we focus on medicare as a payer within its established relationship  of kidney transplantations are medicare patients we have strong relationships with the moldx program also based on our history with allomap repeat testing similar to allomap patients on allosure will follow our surveillance protocol providing a recurring revenue opportunity with multiple tests provided and lastly revolutionary technology targeted sequencing technology provides for fast turnaround time and competitive cost of testing the approach of measuring cellfree dna is already a proven game changer in oncology and prenatal testing now we look forward to updating you further on our launch strategy in providing some reimbursement updates on coming calls moving onto a quick update regarding our balance sheet during the quarter we signed a debt agreement with jcb and were in discussions to restructure our obligations with former majority shareholders in sweden we believe these activities have the potential to increase our financial flexibility in front of our allosure launch in closing im very pleased that we received the draft lcd from palmetto and hit that milestone as planned but looking forward now id like to remind you about our other milestones that we are excited about and you should monitor the potential restructuring of our obligations to the former majority shareholders of allenex the allosure pricing which is expected later this year and our launch in october the olerup qtype activities with ce mark expected later this year as well as continued growth on allomap as we rollout our allomap at home program i will now turn the call over to mike to discuss our financials michael bell thank you peter firstly id like to say that im pleased to have joined the team at such a critical time and ahead of such large commercial opportunities while today were reporting only preliminary results i look forward to releasing final results in coming weeks and getting our financial protocols on track for more timely reporting in the future preliminary first quarter  revenue is in the range of  million to  million compared to  million in the first quarter of  the yearoveryear increase in revenue reflects three drivers first olerup contributed revenue of  million in q note that we completed the acquisition of the olerup business in april  second allomap us tests volume grew  in third quarter  and third we continue to improve our cash collection operations these two allomaprelated drivers have resulted in allomap revenue in the range of  million to  million in q up from  million in the prior year for q our preliminary net loss was in a range of  million to  million compared to a net loss of  million in the same period of  i wanted to briefly comment on bringing our financial processes in order the team here has faced some significant challenges because of the various acquisitions over the last  months that together with the late filing of the k impacted our ability to file the q on time we expect to file a q in the very near future and going forward we brought in deloitte to work with the team to help us improve our financial close process and accounting controls im already seeing the positive impact from this initiative and im confident that our future filings will be back on track for the next quarter youll see from the strong revenue performance on allomap that the team has successfully enhanced the billing activities i have two things we can continue to get better in that area weve already upgraded a lot of the processes and activities but based on my experience from previous companies i see room to further improve in one of the upcoming calls id be happy to update you on our thinking on how to further increase collections and reduce our dsos turning to guidance weve no change there for  we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of  million to  million our guidance is based on allomap and olerup revenue and excludes any potential revenue from allosure ill turn the call back to peter for closing comments peter maag thank you very much mike we appreciate you joining the call were now happy to address any questions questionandanswer session operator thank you sir operator instructions our first question will come from the line of bill quirk with piper jaffray please proceed bill quirk i guess your first question here you reiterated guidance so is it safe to assume given youre pretty far in q at this point that volumes continue to track kind of according to your plan peter maag absolutely allomap is doing very well you see that the  growth in the first quarter has been a very good solid growth and were tracking against our plans absolutely bill quirk and then maybe you could just kind of elaborate a little bit more on the allomap growth obviously the  number was i think something higher than the street was looking for so maybe you can just elaborate on pockets of strength there is it sustainable maybe how should we be thinking about that metering itself over the balance of the year peter maag our activities to drive protocol adherence have bear or borne a number of fruits in key centers and they have been so positive that were actually rolling this out in  more centers in the first half of this year we see on average bill that roughly if we look at the numbers patients experience about five to six allomaps over the lifetime after transplantation and we think that based on these protocols it could be in the  to  allomaps range if we activity involve all results in the process so translate that into  centers there is going to be continued growth on allomap which is very exciting what we do here is we actually help these centers to schedule the allomap blood draw based on a predefined schedule and by doing that we ensure that they actually come to the center gets the blood drawn and the allomap is in the electronic medical record prior to the visit of the patient next time at the center so that has proven to be very exciting and important also medically for this patient to receive the allomap prior to the visit michael bell okay great and then i guess last question from me is just on allosure i am thinking a few steps ahead here in terms of getting to the pricing decision by the mac how should we think about this peter gap fill crosswalk kind of any chatter that you can share at this point will be very helpful thank you peter maag i think there are really three important elements when thinking about these pricings and youve mentioned the couple the first one would be a crosswalk type of methodology while moldx is not using our crosswalk specifically here i think the really the analog products to be compared to is actually allomap is the posttransplant surveillance method on a slightly different technology gene expression profiling but with the price of  list and  i think it sets a nice analog for as type of crosswalk methodology when we are thinking about considering the health economic impacts of allosure clearly there is an easy comparison to alleviating the needs of biopsies in kidney transplantation and these biopsies are very invasive and obviously a big issue and then a bigger health economic impact even is the optimization of immunosuppressive therapy and the issues that are associated with immunosuppressive therapy over long periods of time and the third element clearly is what was the investment what is the cost of producing the test that will come into an equation of an valuation on pricing of this product and as there is underlying sequencing technology you can probably appreciate that the experts on the moldx side are very familiar with cost associated with on the one hand the evidence development but then also with the cost of producing a result and we have a lot of experience with that but i think these are the three major elements for pricing up allomap  allosure sorry operator thank you our next question will come from line of kevin ellich with craig hallum please proceed kevin ellich so just following up on bills question on the strong allomap volume  do you think you guys should be continue that type growth rate or you should be few more fluctuation as we the years goes on peter maag i think if you look over the last few quarters we have mentioned that we think of allomap growth somewhere between  and  range this quarter has been a very strong quarter with  growth i think its a product that has really found its place as a standard of care in heart transplantation and what we saw actually last year that there was a bit of an underlying uptick in organ availability i think that has supported allomap growth and todd and the team are doing a very good job our chief commercial officer todd whitson who came over from prenatal diagnostics testing company and has really helped to shape our marketing and sales focus and drive volume growth so yes i think the  is a good growth and lets see what we can do in the second quarter kevin ellich and then just going back to allosure and you know we understand you provided a lot of good detail on the process for the pathway for medicare reimbursement and also youre looking for you know and i know  of the kidney transplant patients are medicare what about the commercial side theyre still  would you expect commercial reimbursement to follow suit very quickly and do you think itll be in a same sort of range that youre looking at for medicare peter maag i think weve been very successful in the company to not contract allomap below the medicare rate and in hindsight i think that has been proven to be a very wise decision and so we continue to believe that thats the right way forward we do have relationships with payers that allow us to see the interest levels and there are few payers that i think are forward leaning and forward thinking about high value molecular diagnostic tests i think we’re laser sharp focused right now on the medicare reimbursement because it is  and we follow the  to  rule what youll see actually in the draft local coverage decision what is very exciting is that theres not limitation on length of testing so it actually allosure starts two weeks after transplantation and theres no limitation in terms of use and the second one is actually a relatively broad label where we think that we can actually provide a lot of allosure value to patients by monitoring these patients over a long period of time so i think thats were very pleased with the outcome of the draft local coverage decision provided under medicare kevin ellich great and then on allomap i think mike mentioned  gross margin i guess have you guys ever provided where do you think those margins can go and then what should we expect once  obviously we need to find out what the pricing will be for allosure but you think we should see something similar in terms of gross margin on that product as well that process as well michael bell this is mike yes currently the gross margin on allomap is between the  and  and absolutely as we launch allosure and thats about to take on some of the overhead related to allomap then you know were targeting around the  gross margin for allomap kevin ellich okay and then mike since i got you one quick one for you on the balance sheet do you think you need to you know you mentioned you kind of wanted to structure the balance sheet a little bit can you give us any color you know what you bring over the last month since joining the company and also what do you want to do with the balance sheet and where the cash burn lies right now michael bell with respect to the cash burn were burning around  million a quarter on the operations and with our current cash balance at the moment thats going to get us well through the allosure launch so thats our first priority is to get us to that i think towards the end of the year we want to strengthen the balance sheet further to allow us to you know to continue the commercialization into  theres nothing specific we can share at the moment on that and when we can we will do operator thank you operator instructions our next question will come from nicholas jansen with raymond james please proceed nicholas jansen first from me just on that last point mike i do believe from the swedish shareholder perspective theres a deferred payment in july that youre hoping to push out can you maybe just give some clarity on when that payment is due how we should be thinking about the timeline for you guys to get rid of that or delay that michael bell i think therere really two components for the swedish shareholders the one is the deferred acquisition payment thats in the neighborhood of  million and then the other one would be a loan agreement in the allenex organization of roughly  to make it  they get to the  million so theres a total obligation to  million weve been in good relationship with the shareholders they actually do own a significant portion of caredx stock at this stage so weve been in very good conversations and we see them in the past having deferred some of these payments that we will be able to defer some of these payments going forward as we get closer to finalizing these agreements well be sharing that news with you nicholas jansen and then talking about the allosure commercialization i know youre going to be leveraging your sales force pretty aggressively given the overlap but just wanted to get your thoughts on how we should be thinking about if theres any sort of incremental sales hires any new incremental marketing programs and dollar spent on the upfront commercialization process as we kind of think about that  million per quarter of cash burn thanks michael bell actually were going to launch this product with seven people in sales and four of the medical sales liaisons so  people in the field weve upgraded our marketing team already in the first quarter so dont expect large expenditures and then changes in terms of cash burn for the organization nicholas jansen and then my last question would be if pama was to kind of stick to its word in terms of using commercial rates as a benchmark for medicare going forward how do we think about your existing allomap franchise and i believe commercial is currently above what medicare paid you at a time being so how much incremental revenue or opportunity would that be if that did get finalized as constructed peter maag thanks nic for reminding me we actually did mention that our calculation have led to a submission of  allomap pricing when we take the commercial contracted price if we translate this into this roughly  sales increase to our overall volume on medicare were talking about roughly  to  increase on same volume so we see this as an upside opportunity theres a lot of jitter in the market around the implementation of pama but we see this as a key upside going into the next year operator thank you we have follow up questions from the line of kevin ellich with craighallum please proceed kevin ellich peter just one followup for me why does it take two weeks before you can start the allosure testing our understanding was that prednisone does not impact the testing capability like allomap peter maag kevin i might not have understood your question can you repeat it kevin ellich yes i think in your prepared remarks you said that you cant expect allosure testing two weeks following the transplant is that right peter maag yes just after transplantation when  the procedure of transplanting an organ into an individual is causing a lot of damage of the cells and just to be on the safe side that really the cellfree dna so that the damage cells that we are measuring are really coming from a healthy and working organs there is a two weeks lapse after transplantation before we can perform the first allosure test operator thank you there are no further questions in the queue for now it is now pleasure to hand the conference back over to mr peter maag chief executive officer for closing comments or remarks sir peter maag well this is a very quick and thank you very much for attending the call i am looking forward to updating you further on our

peter peter maag thanks mark good afternoon everyone as we have done on our previous quarterly calls i’d like to begin with a patient story as many of us fly united airlines you might have followed the chicago tribune story about the united ceo oscar munoz he took over as united ceo in september suffered a heart attack in october and received a heart transplant in january back to work in march this is quite amazing and highlights the life changing potential of successful transplantation it is life changing story like this one that inspire us at caredx  was the year of substantial progress for caredx we closed  having achieved all of our strategic objectives including further development of cellfree dna with allosure increasing allomap patient adoption and pursuing external growth opportunities including the transaction we announced to acquire allenex we’ll start this call by covering our cellfree dna pipeline then i’ll cover our allomap business and provide an update on the transaction ken will cover the financials for the fourth quarter and fullyear  and then we look forward to your questions before we discuss operational highlights i would like to briefly comment on our overall performance for the fullyear  total revenue for the year was  million with allomap revenue being  million up  over  we provided more than  allomap patient results allomap test volume continues to be a strong foundation for our business we saw  yearoveryear volume growth which underscores the importance of allomap as a core product for caredx ken will talk through the dynamics of test growth versus revenue growth in his section overall we believe that having reimbursement and billing inhouse is a core capability for a molecular diagnostics company we are succeeding in building a strong rd effort centered on our cellfree dna technology that promises impact on even more patients with focus on kidney transplant surveillance the increased rd effort translated into a ramp of rd expenses primarily associated with the development of our inhouse cellfree dna assay allosure and our ongoing clinical trials i’m extremely pleased with the progress that were making and the investments that we have made since that we first outlined our strategy more than a year ago let me now focus my comments on the three strategic objectives we pursued in  development of cellfree dna allomap patient adoption and external growth opportunities first i want to highlight the progress we made on allosure our proprietary nextgeneration sequencing test that measures the percent of donorderived cellfree dna in solid organ transplant recipients our initial focus for allosure will be kidney transplantation we completed rigorous analytical validation of allosure following professional organization next generation sequencing guidelines and recommendations such as cap amp acmg and ashg we used a specially designed thirdparty prepared reference standards quantitatively characterized by digital pcr and the national institute of standards and testing human reference genome in the validation to ensure sequence accuracy and quantitation computational analysis used customer sample bestinclass software modules and a cloud platform selected by precision fda the fda’s effort in support of president obama’s precision medicine initiative allosure is accurate reproducible and sets a new bar for thoroughness of analytical validation for a cellfree dna laboratorydeveloped test in  caredx presented ngs analytical validation recommendations at the fda sponsored workshop in november in washington we also opened a dedicated purposebuilt clia lab for allosure in our brisbane headquarters this provides us the ability to offer the latest genomic technologies for our growing pipeline of assays dedicated to improving transplantation management additionally we have made significant progress in our dart trial an observational study designed to demonstrate the clinical validity of cellfree dna in detecting rejection in kidney allograft recipients the study is also designed to demonstrate the correlation of circulating cellfree dna to renal function estimated from serum creatinine we initially planned to enroll  patients in more than  centers and collect patient blood samples we exceeded plan with  patients enrolled by december st up from  in the third quarter in  transplant centers up from  reported in q in total these centers have already collected over  samples and associated clinical visit data as of march   we plan to deliver our first analysis in the first half of this year with a timing primarily driven by the number of patient samples that are associated with clinical events especially rejections following this first analysis of the dart study we plan to begin a clinical drug called rose in the second half of this year the focus of rose will be to demonstrate clinical utility in support of reimbursement in a medicare population medicare covers more than  of kidney transplant patients we continue to be on track with our development plan these milestones are consistent with previous communication in addition to dart we have two more clinical studies underway our outcomes allomap registry study or oar and our cellfree dna outcomes allomap registry or doar enrollment continues to grow in the oar study at the end of  we had taken almost  samples up from  at the end of the third quarter from  patients up from about  last quarter from  centers the longterm outcome data collected will continue to build clinical evidence for the use of allomap we see this not only as a longterm commitment to the field of transplantation but also as an invaluable source for future scientific insight generation we are seeing a lot of interest from opinion leaders to use this date to gain further insights into patient management we continue to make cellfree dna results available from our clia laboratory in combination with allomap through our doar registry as of december  the doar trial was in  centers up from  at the end of the third quarter with  patients enrolled up from  and  samples collected up from  this effort continues to support evidence generation of cellfree dna in organ transplantation we continue to build an invaluable repository of well annotated sample that link genomic data with clinical information now turning to our second strategic initiative which is to increase the adoption of allomap our surveillance solution for heart transplant recipients out of the  heart transplant centers in the us allomap was used in  during the last  months as of the end of the fourth quarter there were  centers with established allomap protocols up from  in the previous quarter and  in the quarter before that during the fourth quarter we hit an important commercialization milestone in europe with our partner diaxonhit a french leader in specialty invitro diagnostics we completed the technology transfer of allomap into strasbourg university hospital central immunology laboratory hus in france we established a rigorous multistep validation process which demonstrated that allomap test results released from the hus laboratory are equivalent to allomap results generated by our laboratory here in brisbane patient samples can now be tested at hus this unique partnership with both a prestigious university based laboratory and a strong commercial organization increases the availability of allomap for transplant patients in europe i’m also pleased with the execution of our commercial strategy which coordinates allomap patient customer engagement drives establishment and adherence to protocols and supports transplant centers in optimizing their workflow the three key initiatives that we have been working on are stakeholder engagement to involve patients and physicians in the direction we take our technology clinical data and education to continue to build the evidence in support of allomap and protocol development and adherence to continue to expand the utility of allomap a highlight of our ongoing development efforts is our recent release of allomap score variability for amv that’s an additional tool for heart transplant clinicians in october research conducted on amv was published in journal bmc cardiovascular disorders this published study is the first to report on positive and negative predictive values key to informing test use in a patient population the allomap variability assay identifies which patients are at risk of future clinical events thereby facilitating adjustments of patient management strategies in other words allomap variability predicts risk of future allograft events while each single allomap identifies the risk of acute rejection at the time of testing this is a particularly exciting area for patients that are in the timeframe two years to five years posttransplant amv which is available from for allomap test results with in a  months period will provide additional insights to clinicians for patient risk stratification there are now  centers receiving allomap variability scores up from nine in the third quarter of  on the reimbursement front we continue to have positive coverage decisions from most major carriers as of december   we had been reimbursed for approximately  of all allomap results delivered in the  month ended june   and just a few weeks ago we announced tricare national insurance came out with a positive coverage policy for allomap tricare covers over nine million lives and is heart of the military health care system this coverage is need to access back one year to february  allomap continues to be broadly reimbursed in comparison to other highvalue molecular diagnostic offerings in  allomap reimbursement was steady at  in  we received a cpt code as we are currently going through the cms caption ph process with allomap we expect reimbursement to remain at this price going forward on july  we brought allomap billing and collection activities inhouse as we grow and launch new tests we expect to see a reduction in cost of the reimbursement effort and an increase in effectiveness through direct control over the entire process as mentioned earlier we think about this as a core competency of a pioneering molecular diagnostic company now moving on to our external growth opportunities as you most of you are aware in december we reached an agreement to purchase  of the outstanding share of allenex we are currently working through the conditions of closing allenex is a transparent transplant diagnostic company based in stockholm sweden that develops manufactures market and sells product that match donor organs with potential recipients prior to transplantation we anticipate to finish the tender offer period with swedish stockholders and expect to complete the acquisition in midapril this combination will create an international transplantation diagnostics company with expanded distribution and additional overall growth potential let me tell you why i’m excited about allenex the olerup ssp line which addresses human leukocyte antigen or hla testing is used to match transplant recipients with donors organs the olerup ssp line is established in the marketplace and is complementary to our product the majority of allenex operations are in europe which represents  of the  revenues they have five direct reps in europe and five in the us their team is very knowledgeable talented and well respected the olerup brand is very well known in the field and important relationships have been established over decades pro forma combined revenues for  were approximately  million this represents a unique strategic fit with little over that overlap between our standalone companies combine caredx we’ll have product offerings along the prepost transplant continuum and presence and direct distribution channels in the us and in europe we are excited about this combination and look forward to sharing more with you at an analyst and investors day that we are planing to host in midapril in new york before we move onto financial i would like to speak a little bit more about striving to be a bestinclass transplant focused molecular diagnostic company and how we strengthened our organization by bringing on great people as an example for an incredible team that we have currently in the company and that we are building in the beginning of  dr john sninsky joined as chief scientific officer to head our product development initiative dr sninsky is an expert in the diagnostic space with the wealth of experience he has made significant contributions leading us through the product development milestones we hit this year and we expect more to come now i’ll turn the call over to ken ken ludlum okay thanks peter allomap revenue for the full year  was  million up about  over  allomap volume growth was up  for the year allomap revenue in the fourth quarter was  million flat with the fourth quarter of  revenues would have been higher but for a delay in collections of cash basis test from our former billings and collections vendor as peter mentioned in july we transferred this activity to an inhouse team but the prior vendor remained responsible for following the collections on the tests performed through june we have now also taken over collections on those tests performed prior to june and expect to collect on a number of these tests and recognize this revenue in  based on the prior collection history we estimate that we’ll recognize approximately  to  in revenue from these tests collaboration revenue was also lower than a yearago i would remind you that in the fourth quarter of  we had a  million payment due to the winding down of the partnership with labcorp which effects comparability of this quarter in addition we have decided to change the revenue recognition from accrual accounting to cash revenue recognition for the regular ongoing royalties we received from a technology license as a result of this change we reversed the third quarter’s revenue that we had previously recognized and will not recognize the fourth quarter’s revenue until it is actually paid this amounted to approximately  in the fourth quarter of  and the reversal of  from the third quarter of  cost of testing in the third quarter was  million compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  this translated to a gross margin of  in line with recent performance but down from the fourth quarter of  performance of  rd expense was  million in the third quarter – in the fourth quarter rather compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  the change reflects an increase in all clinical trial activities especially the cellfree dna clinical area which did not exist last year and then expanded rd effort in general sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter were  million compared to  million in the fourth quarter of last year this increase was primarily related to an increase in marketing programs ga expenses were  million for the quarter up from  million in the fourth quarter of  as discussed earlier we brought billing and collection inhouse this year which will reduce expenses starting in  after a transition period during which we ran our old outside service and our inhouse activities in parallel in addition expenses related to the acquisition and those accounting fees contributed to the increase yearoveryear fourth quarter  net loss was  million compared to a loss of  for the same quarter in  basic and diluted loss per share of  in the quarter compared with breakeven eps numbers in the yearago quarter remember in the yearago period the beneficial  million onetime payment from labcorp boosted the bottom line significantly shares outstanding for this year’s quarter were  million compared to  million a yearago turning to the balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter we had  million in cash and cash equivalents versus  million at december   given proximity to the closing of the allenex acquisition and how it will affect the size of caredx we will not be providing  financial guidance at this time however we plan to discuss our outlook for  at the analysts and investors day in midapril after the allenex deal closes i will now turn the call back to peter for a few closing remarks peter maag as we’re closing on  we are also turning the page by announcing a cfo transition we announced today that ken will be leaving the company and charles constanti will be joining us as the cfo i’m thankful to ken for his partnership in the last two years he was instrumental in guiding us through the ipo process he has also been a terrific travel companion and i will miss him i’m pleased that ken has agreed to remain with the company until june to ensure a smooth transition with charles constanti we are bringing a seasoned financial expert on board that will allow the organization to realize its future growth aspirations charles brings with him a lot of international finance and accounting expertise which will be important as we close and integrate the allenex acquisition i’m looking forward to working with charles it will be a great addition to the team in summary i’m delighted by the progress we made throughout  and into  as we move towards advancing our mission to improve patient outcomes in transplant care our key objectives for  are develop allosure into a commercial product for kidney transplantations integrate allenex and further build out an international diagnostics company focused on the transplant continuum continue to grow allomap our core product in transplant medicine we look forward to updating you on our progress at our upcoming investor and analyst day midapril and on future calls with that i would now like to open the call up for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of bill quirk from piper jaffray your question please laura sand hi everyone this is laura sand on for bill first question regarding the cfo transition i guess why is now the right time for the change ken ludlum well so this is ken speaking and ive just decided that im going to rebalance my life a little bit im not leaving for any particular future position or occupation but i told peter that i wanted to rebalance a little bit and that gave everybody enough time to allow for a smooth transition laura sand okay thank you for the clarity and then with the allenex deal closing in midapril how are you looking at topline synergies and also what is your strategy for the timing of beyond integration process peter maag perfect laura thank you so much and obviously we are in the midst of finalizing the transaction middle of april as you said and then swiftly going into the integration process we really see there are two synergies for the business on the one hand we have a very strong established us presence with caredx we have access to  transplant centers that we regularly call on to give you a bit of an understanding the allenex organization is really relatively young in the united states with the presence in west chester pennsylvania so we think there will be crossselling opportunities on the long run theres a slightly different call point as were calling on to a transplant center more from the clinical and the coordinator perspective and theyre calling on the lab head but more and more we see these centers are coming together with lab directors and clinicians are sitting around the table talking about individual patients and then on the other hand we have the europe presence of allenex they have a very vast distributor network all over the globe and we believe that with our growing products see allosure and all those we can build that presence out on the medium to longterm so dont expect immediate revenue synergies but on the mid to longterm there is clearly a benefit of being a global transplant business because transplantation is a pretty global business laura sand great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dan leonard from leerink partners your question please michael sarcone guys this is actually michael sarcone on for dan leonard peter maag hi ken ludlum hi mike michael sarcone so it’s look like the allomap volumes declined sequentially in the quarter you think maybe you can kind of elaborate a bit on that and talk about what you were seeing there peter maag yes i think what’s very important mike is that we measure our business more on quarter versus previous year quarter and you see healthy growth in the allomap franchise of  in terms of volume growth when you look at revenue recognition i think ken was outlining the lack of the revenue recognition because of the transition of the billing process but in terms of underlying volume growth you see that we’ve been for the year growing  and in the quarter  so i think it’s a healthy healthy gross for allomap given where it is in the lifecycle we continue to be successful and very excited around allomap variability which i would consider being like a lifecycle management activity for the product and we continue to have a few holdouts especially in the northeast that we hope to penetrate going forward so that will continue to drive allomap volumes in the future michael sarcone okay so nothing really to call out what the sequential decline because we haven’t really seen that in the q in the past peter maag our business very much driven by the number of working days and the number of days the patient come in to see clinicians and given the low numbers – having two working days more or less makes actually a big difference but in the overall look at it from a quarter over previous year quarter growth which is the  growth michael sarcone understood thanks and my second question can you give us an update on the qtype product launch i know you guys had some sensors testing the kids can you comment on initial feedback peter maag yes i’d like to reserve that comment until we have concluded the transaction please be bear with me that we’ll given where it is today we’ll only comment on this once we have closed the transaction mike michael sarcone sure thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of paul knight from janney montgomery scott your question please paul knight first of all i enjoyed working with ken so i’m sorry to see the transition in some ways so thanks to ken and then my question would be on the volumes i mean you had  yearoveryear in q  revenue growth for the year you’re not providing guidance on  but i guess what you’re implying is that the trend in q seems visible is that a fair assumption ken ludlum the trend in q is visible paul paul knight well the q volume growth of  and i guess we should assume that  outlook for volume growth is unchanged peter maag yes yes that’s right paul knight and then regarding data i know you’re looking may be as soon as june on additional allosure data is that – are you still with that peter peter maag yes absolutely no we’re right on line it’s in line with previous communication dart trial is on course super excited with the  centers end of december there might be one more center in the first quarter coming in but we’re well ahead in terms of our first analysis in the first half of this year and in previous communication we always mentioned in june there is the american transplant congress which is an important date for us as a company paul knight and then i know there is a chance that the cms may reimburse patients in these trials under the early innovation program are you still – is that still a possibility peter peter maag yes i know – the rose trial as we are combining this and thinking about it this initiative under coverage under data development that palmetto is spearheading in the us i think our trial or our products will be uniquely positioned for that it is granted by palmetto so it is not something that the company would apply for but it is granted that we think it is a unique offering for transplantations and it lends itself to such a program so we are hopeful for this coverage on the data development program paul knight do you think that coverage is  or is it this year kind of coverage or can you tell peter maag well i think it really depends on – paul on the readout of the clinical trial data of dart we will need to build the case that clinicians are using the product and feel comfortable on using the product to – as changing something in the patient treatment algorithm of these posttransplant surveillance patient so i think as soon as we know on the dart trial that will give us a very strong handle but keep in mind we have very strong academic data in the past we also have some analysis performed on heart transplantation so we’ll have a basket of clinical data available for palmetto and others to make the decision on how this trial should look like and how should we think about outcomes in these transplant patients rose will be focused on how do we get reimbursement for allosure because it’s a clinically analytically valid – sorry – it’s an analytically validated test that is available as of today here in our brisbane lab paul knight okay thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of eric criscuolo from mizuho your question please eric criscuolo good afternoon i guess echoing paul ken enjoy your future endeavors there ken ludlum thank you eric criscuolo you’re welcome pleasure working with you and i guess can you – about the billing issue that you had as far as the collections as you move to inhouse collecting i think you brought that that whole service inside caredx in july so why did that kind of effect you now versus when you first brought everything inhouse peter maag well in the – at the start of that the medicare payments come in and there are at least half of our revenue and i mean everything seem to be going okay in the july through august september timeframe and then we realized about november that things were slowing down so we took a couple of actions and we finally decided to take over direct supervision of collecting those tests so we actually hired the team leader from that vendor to head up our effort here to recoup those payments but there was a – these tests were collected actually the cash collections the medicare payments coming in  days but these cash collected tests can take six months to nine months to collect the majority of them so there’s a long tail on the cash collections eric criscuolo got you okay and you are pretty certain though that you’ll collect pretty much everything that you’ve been waiting for peter maag yes we’ve – the figure we gave you has been scrub down and filtered quite a bit from all the potential tests so we’re trying to get to a realistic number of what we think is collectable based on what’s been collectable in the past from the same insurance carriers eric criscuolo got you okay thank you and i guess if you could just talk about allenex maybe and then how they fit in the competitive landscape versus other hla typing companies and kind of where you think they are and maybe where they can go in that whole business peter maag yes – no i mean overall we build a clinical diagnostic company with the focus on transplantation we have a strong presence in the posttransplant heart with allosure we enter all posttransplants or that organ testing and now with allenex we had a pretransplant component with the focus on hla matching what glues all this together is the advances in clinical diagnostics with ngs solutions and the push for personalized medicine i think we need to do a better job in identifying patients that benefit from extremely costly procedures and then optimize the treatment and transplantations are among the highest cost patient it makes perfect sense to start there but with allenex now we have a prepost transplant continuum and will be a formidable competitor in that space that’s currently dominated by one company which is one lambda which was two years acquired by thermo fisher so i think we have a unique product offering now that we can have clinicians and lab directors think of caredx is helping them to manage these patients on the prepost transplant continuum something that we do with our clinical expertise and we expect that there will be a lot of excitement around that space eric criscuolo how much bigger is one lambda versus allenex peter maag they have multiple offering so think of them as  million  million revenue type of company eric criscuolo okay thank you and just lastly allosure reimbursements have you started conversations with payers and maybe kind of give an update on where you stand there peter maag eric it’s a great question what’s unique and special about transplant patients and especially kidney transplant patients  of transplant patients or these kidney transplant patients are actually medicare patients because they have – most of them have undergone dialysis previously and by the time they get transplanted they are medicare patients so having reimbursement from medicare is the sole focus for us as an organization to make the successful now in the past the moldex program actually has been advancing reimbursement in these novel diagnostic tests because they have capabilities and individuals that believe on this good clinical data driving better information going forward so we have had excellent relationships that we established over years with the allomap reimbursement given the value proposition of our product in our company so there’s very close ties to experts in the field of reimbursement of multicollector diagnostics and we believe we can leverage this into the allosure program but keep in mind that we are all about evidence and we believe we need to do the clinical trials to demonstrate the evidence to get the product reimbursed that our trial is a substantial undertaking the doar trial is very substantial and will drive clinical information and evidence that makes it easy for a payer to say yes that is truly valuable for transplantations and reimburse the product eric criscuolo so i guess you have to wait for those results to come through before you submit some kind of full dossier to medicare peter maag yes i think it’s very important this is all data driven and evidence based and we believe in that and we have very strong analytical validation data which we’ll share we now add clinical validation data to that and then there is a question about how do we think about use of the test and what’s the right time of reimbursement so we don’t think of this as just such a step function but actually as we grow in evidence development their survive time of the reimbursing this product this coverage under data development might be a good compromise of having early reimbursement but still continue to build evidence for using the test eric criscuolo great thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of carolina ibanezventoso from janney montgomery your question please carolina ibanezventoso hi good afternoon i only have one question guys we know that you have a busy year ahead of you but can you share with us any effects the company is going to make this year towards – if i look in your bioinformatics platform thank you peter maag hi carolina thank you so much for that question because it’s really the mid to longterm strategy for the company as we think about patient management and transplant surveillance it really starts linking the hla data pretransplant together with the posttransplant surveillance data and – we for that we need to have a bioinformatics platform we’ve been making excellent progress on establishing web portals with these  transplant centers some of them are now ordering allomap online and we actually play back the allomap result back into these centers and we’re thinking about even integrating the allomap results into the electronic medical record we have built relationships with nextgeneration sequencing data and cloud computing organizations to really form out this bioinformatics network this is something that will take a couple of years to develop john sninsky and his team are actively pursuing that but we say we’re very excited about building a bioinformatics platform that also links back external databases such as unos into this continuum we continue to believe that our diagnostic tests are the revenue generator and so our revenue model will be linked to the testing revenue but ultimately what is driving the use of our test will be data that we’re providing back to the clinicians for decision making and providing this data in a better form will be very very important going forward carolina ibanezventoso thank you operator thank you and this does conclude the questionandanswer session of today’s program i’d like to hand the program back to peter maag for closing remarks peter maag well thank you very much for spending thursday afternoon and evening with us we are very much looking forward to continuously
