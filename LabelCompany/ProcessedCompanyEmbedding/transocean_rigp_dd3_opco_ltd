predecessors unless the context requires otherwise transocean partners we us or our is a growthoriented limited liability company formed by transocean ltd together with its subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context requires otherwise transocean one of the worlds largest offshore drilling contractors to own operate and acquire modern technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs our assets consist of  percent ownership interest in each of the entities that owns or operates our three ultradeepwater drilling rigs that are currently operating in the us gulf of mexico each individually a rigco and collectively the rigcos transocean owns the remaining  percent noncontrolling interest in each of the rigcos we generate revenue through contract drilling services which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet related equipment and work crews on a dayrate basis to large international energy companies to drill oil and gas wells         our drilling rigs currently operate under longterm contracts with chevron corporation and bp plc two leading international energy companies with an average remaining contract term of approximately  years as of july   the shortest of which is contracted through november  we believe that our drilling contracts will continue to generate stable and reliable cash flows over their term we depend on transocean affiliates to assist us with the operation of our drilling units management of our customer relationships renewing existing and obtaining new drilling contracts and to perform other administrative support activities we intend to use the relationships and expertise of transocean to recontract our fleet when the existing contracts expire and identify opportunities to expand our fleet through acquisitions         we were formed in february  under the laws of the republic of the marshall islands our registered and principal executive offices are located at deepwater house kingswells causeway prime four business park aberdeen ab pu scotland united kingdom and our phone number is     we maintain a website at wwwtransoceanpartnerscom where general information about us is available we are not incorporating the contents of the website into this prospectus  table of contents         we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  or the jobs act for as long as we are deemed an emerging growth company we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies as an emerging growth company we may for up to five years take advantage of specified exemptions from reporting and other regulatory requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory sayonpay votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards an emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of all of the applicable jobs act exemptions including the exemption provided by section  of the jobs act as described above this election to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards is irrevocable accordingly the information that we provide unitholders may be different than what holders may receive from other public companies in which you hold equity interests relationship with transocean         one of our principal strengths is our relationship with transocean transocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells transocean retains a significant interest in us through its ownership of common and subordinated units representing an aggregate  percent limited liability company interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights transocean partners holdings limited the transocean member an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of transocean ltd holds the transocean member interest which is a noneconomic interest in us that includes the right to appoint three of the seven members of our board of directors under our limited liability company agreement common unitholders that own  percent or more of our common units have the ability to request that cumulative voting be in effect for the election of elected directors cumulative voting is an irrevocable election that allows for the unitholder to allocate its votes cumulatively rather than proportionally therefore for so long as transocean owns  percent or more of our common units it will have the ability to request that cumulative voting be in effect for the election of elected directors which would enable transocean to elect one or more of the elected directors even after it owns less than  percent of our common units as a result if cumulative voting was in effect transocean would have the ability to appoint the majority of our board as long as it retains at least  percent of our common units the directors appointed by transocean may designate a member of the board of directors to be the chairman of the board of directors specific rights of the transocean member are designated in our second amended and restated limited liability company agreement         we believe that our relationship with transocean provides us with access to leading international energy companies as well as suppliers and other key service providers for our industry we also believe that transoceans operational and managerial expertise enables us to compete more effectively for contract opportunities than other contract drilling companies similar in size to us  table of contents risk factors         investing in our

 days after the end of each quarter we will distribute all of our available cash defined below to unitholders of record on the applicable record date  table of contents definition of available cash         available cash generally means for each fiscal quarter all cash on hand at the end of that quarter including our proportionate share of cash on hand of subsidiaries we do not wholly own including the rigcos  less  the amount of cash reserves including our proportionate share of cash reserves of certain subsidiaries we do not wholly own including the rigcos established by our board of directors to  provide for the proper conduct of our business including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated future debt service requirements subsequent to that quarter  comply with applicable law any debt instruments or other agreements and  provide funds for distributions to our unitholders for any one or more of the next four quarters provided that our board of directors may not establish cash reserves for distributions if the effect of the establishment of such reserves will prevent us from paying the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units and any cumulative arrearages on such common units for the current quarter  plus  all cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash resulting from cash distributions received after the end of such quarter on equity interests in any person other than a subsidiary held by us or any of our subsidiaries which distributions are paid by such person in respect of operations conducted by such person during such quarter  plus  if our board of directors so determines all or any portion of the cash on hand including our proportionate share of cash on hand of subsidiaries we do not wholly own including the rigcos on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made subsequent to the end of such quarter         the purpose and effect of the last bullet point above is to allow our board of directors if it so decides to use cash from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter but on or before the date of determination of available cash for that quarter to pay distributions to unitholders under our limited liability company agreement working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that are made under a credit facility commercial paper facility or similar financing arrangement and in all cases are used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to members and with the intent of the borrower to repay such borrowings within twelve months with funds other than from additional working capital borrowings distribution of the minimum quarterly distribution         we intend to distribute to the holders of common units and subordinated units on a quarterly basis at least the minimum quarterly distribution of  per unit or  per unit per year to the extent we have sufficient cash on hand to pay the distribution after we establish cash reserves and pay fees and expenses including reimbursements of expenses to the transocean member and its affiliates beginning with the third quarter of  we have paid the minimum quarterly distribution amount to holders of our common units and subordinated units on november   february   and may   however there is no guarantee that we will pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our units in any quarter even if our cash distribution policy is not modified or revoked the amount of distributions paid and the decision to make any distribution is determined by our board of directors taking into consideration the terms of our limited liability company agreement  table of contents incentive distribution rights         the transocean member currently holds incentive distribution rights that entitle it to receive increasing percentages up to a maximum of  percent of the cash we distribute from operating surplus as defined below in excess of  per unit per quarter provided that for any fiscal quarter in which the application of our distribution formula would result in the holders of the common units receiving in the aggregate less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter then the distribution to the holders of the incentive distribution rights will be reduced pro rata to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate distribution to the holders of the common units to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter the maximum distribution of  percent does not include any distributions the transocean member or its affiliates may receive on common or subordinated units that they own please read incentive distribution rights below for additional information operating surplus and capital surplus general         all cash distributed to unitholders is characterized as either being paid from operating surplus or capital surplus we treat distributions of available cash from operating surplus differently than distributions of available cash from capital surplus operating surplus         we define operating surplus as   million as described below plus  all of our cash receipts or our proportionate share of cash receipts in the case of subsidiaries that are not wholly owned after the closing of our initial public offering excluding cash from interim capital transactions as defined below provided that cash receipts from the termination of a commodity hedge currency hedge or interest rate hedge prior to its stipulated settlement or termination date shall be included in operating surplus in equal quarterly installments over the remaining scheduled life of such commodity hedge currency hedge or interest rate hedge plus  working capital borrowings made after the end of a quarter but on or before the date of determination of operating surplus for that quarter plus  cash distributions on equity interests in any entity other than subsidiaries held by us or any of our subsidiaries received after the end of the quarter but on or before the date of determination of operating surplus for that quarter in respect of operations of such entity and not from sources that would constitute interim capital transactions if paid by us plus  cash distributions including incremental distributions on incentive distribution rights paid in respect of equity issued to finance all or a portion of expansion capital expenditures in respect of the period from the date that we enter into a binding obligation to commence the construction development replacement improvement or expansion of a capital asset and ending on the earlier to occur of the date the capital asset commences commercial service and the date that it is abandoned or disposed of less  cash distributions including incremental distributions on incentive distribution rights paid in respect of equity issued to pay interest and related fees on debt incurred or to pay distributions on equity issued to finance the expansion capital expenditures referred to in the prior bullet point less  table of contents  all of our operating expenditures as defined below which includes estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures after the closing of our initial public offering less  the amount of cash reserves established by our board of directors to provide funds for future operating expenditures less  all working capital borrowings not repaid within twelve months after having been incurred or repaid within such twelve month period with the proceeds of additional working capital borrowings less  any cash loss realized on dispositions of assets acquired using investment capital expenditures         as described above operating surplus does not reflect actual cash on hand that is available for distribution to our unitholders and is not limited to cash generated by operations for example it includes a provision that will enable us if we choose to distribute as operating surplus up to  million of cash we receive in the future from nonoperating sources such as asset sales issuances of securities and longterm borrowings that would otherwise be distributed as capital surplus in addition the effect of including as described above certain cash distributions on equity interests in operating surplus will be to increase operating surplus by the amount of any such cash distributions as a result we may also distribute as operating surplus up to the amount of any such cash that we receive from nonoperating sources         the proceeds of working capital borrowings increase operating surplus and repayments of working capital borrowings are generally operating expenditures as described below and thus reduce operating surplus when repayments are made however if working capital borrowings which increase operating surplus are not repaid during the twelvemonth period following the borrowing they will be deemed repaid at the end of such period thus decreasing operating surplus at such time when such working capital borrowings are in fact repaid they will not be treated as a further reduction in operating surplus because operating surplus will have been previously reduced by the deemed repayment         we define interim capital transactions as i borrowings refinancings or refundings of indebtedness other than working capital borrowings and items purchased on open account or for a deferred purchase price in the ordinary course of business and sales of debt securities ii issuances of equity securities iii sales or other dispositions of assets other than sales or other dispositions of inventory accounts receivable and other assets in the ordinary course of business and sales or other dispositions of assets as part of normal asset retirements or replacements and iv capital contributions received         we define operating expenditures as all of our cash expenditures including but not limited to taxes reimbursements of expenses of the transocean member and its affiliates officer director and employee compensation interest payments estimated maintenance capital expenditures payments made in the ordinary course of business under interest rate hedge contracts currency hedge contracts and commodity hedge contracts provided that payments made in connection with the termination of any interest rate hedge contract currency hedge contract or commodity hedge contract prior to the stipulated settlement or termination date specified therein will be included in operating expenditures in equal quarterly installments over the remaining scheduled life of such interest rate hedge contract currency hedge contract or commodity hedge contract and amounts paid in connection with the initial purchase of an interest rate hedge contract currency hedge contract or a commodity hedge contract will be amortized over the life of such interest rate hedge contract currency hedge contract or commodity hedge contract maintenance and replacement capital expenditures as discussed in further detail below and repayment of working capital borrowings provided however that operating expenditures will not include  repayments of working capital borrowings where such borrowings have previously been deemed to have been repaid as described above  table of contents  payments including prepayments and prepayment penalties of principal of and premium on indebtedness other than working capital borrowings  expansion capital expenditures investment capital expenditures or actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures which are discussed in further detail under capital expenditures below  payment of transaction expenses including taxes relating to interim capital transactions  distributions to our members or  repurchases of limited liability company interests excluding repurchases we make to satisfy obligations under employee benefit plans capital surplus         capital surplus is defined in our limited liability company agreement as any distribution of available cash in excess of our operating surplus accordingly except as described above capital surplus would generally be generated by  borrowings other than working capital borrowings  sales of our equity and debt securities  sales or other dispositions of assets other than inventory accounts receivable and other assets sold in the ordinary course of business or as part of ordinary course retirement or replacement of assets and  capital contributions received characterization of cash distributions         our limited liability company agreement requires that we treat all available cash distributed as coming from operating surplus until the sum of all available cash distributed since the closing of our initial public offering equals the operating surplus from the closing of such initial public offering through the end of the quarter immediately preceding that distribution our limited liability company agreement requires that we treat any amount distributed in excess of operating surplus regardless of its source as capital surplus our limited liability company agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as the repayment of the consideration for the issuance of units which is as a return of capital we do not anticipate that we will make any distributions from capital surplus capital expenditures         maintenance and replacement capital expenditures are those cash expenditures required to maintain over the longterm the operating capacity asset base or operating income of the company in our limited liability company agreement we refer to these expenditures as maintenance capital expenditures examples of maintenance and replacement capital expenditures include expenditures associated with maintenance modifying an existing drilling rig or acquiring a new drilling rig to the extent such expenditures are incurred to maintain the operating capacity asset base or operating income of the fleet maintenance and replacement capital expenditures will also include interest and related fees including periodic net payments under related interest rate swap agreements on debt incurred and distributions on equity issued including the amount of any incremental distributions made to the holders of our incentive distribution rights to finance the construction of a capital improvement and paid in respect of the construction period which we define as the period beginning on the date that we enter into a binding construction contract and ending on the earlier of the date that the capital improvement commences commercial service or the date that the capital improvement is abandoned or  table of contents disposed of debt incurred to pay or equity issued to fund construction period interest payments and distributions on such equity including the amount of any incremental distributions made to the holders of our incentive distribution rights will also be considered maintenance and replacement capital expenditures         expansion capital expenditures are cash expenditures incurred to increase over the longterm the operating capacity asset base or operating income of the company examples of expansion capital expenditures include expenditures associated with acquiring a new drilling rig or improving an existing drilling rig to the extent those expenditures increase over the long term the operating capacity asset base or operating income of the company expansion capital expenditures will also include interest and related fees including periodic net payments under related interest rate swap agreements on debt incurred and distributions on equity issued including the amount of any incremental distributions made to the holders of our incentive distribution rights to finance all or a portion of expansion capital expenditures paid in respect of the construction period         investment capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that are neither maintenance and replacement capital expenditures nor expansion capital expenditures investment capital expenditures largely will consist of capital expenditures made for investment purposes examples of investment capital expenditures include traditional capital expenditures for investment purposes such as purchases of equity securities as well as other capital expenditures that might be made in lieu of such traditional investment capital expenditures such as the acquisition of a capital asset for investment purposes         capital expenditures that are made in part for maintenance and replacement capital purposes investment capital purposes andor expansion capital purposes will be allocated as maintenance and replacement capital expenditures investment capital expenditures or expansion capital expenditures by our board of directors         because maintenance and replacement capital expenditures can be very large and vary significantly in timing the amount of actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures may differ substantially from period to period which could cause similar fluctuations in the amounts of operating surplus adjusted operating surplus and available cash for distribution to our unitholders if we subtracted actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures from operating surplus each quarter accordingly to eliminate the effect on operating surplus of these fluctuations our limited liability company agreement requires that an amount equal to an estimate of the average quarterly maintenance and replacement capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating capacity of or the revenue generated by our capital assets over the longterm be subtracted from operating surplus each quarter as opposed to the actual amounts spent in our limited liability company agreement we refer to these estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures to be subtracted from operating surplus as estimated maintenance capital expenditures the amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by our board of directors at least once a year provided that any change must be approved by our conflicts committee the estimate will be made at least annually and whenever an event occurs that is likely to result in a material adjustment to the amount of our maintenance and replacement capital expenditures such as a major acquisition or the introduction of new governmental regulations that will affect the fleet for purposes of calculating operating surplus any adjustment to this estimate will be prospective only for a discussion of the amounts we have allocated toward estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures please read our cash distribution policy and restrictions on distributions  table of contents         the use of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures in calculating operating surplus will have the following effects  it will reduce the risk that actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures in any one quarter will be large enough to make operating surplus less than the minimum quarterly distribution to be paid on all the units for that quarter and subsequent quarters  it may reduce the need for us to borrow to pay distributions  it will be more difficult for us to raise our distribution above the minimum quarterly distribution and pay incentive distributions to the transocean member and  it will reduce the likelihood that a large maintenance and replacement capital expenditure in a period will prevent transocean from being able to convert some or all of its subordinated units into common units since the effect of an estimate is to spread the expected expense over several periods mitigating the effect of the actual payment of the expenditure on any single period subordination period general         our limited liability company agreement provides that during the subordination period which we define below the common units will have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus each quarter in an amount equal to  per common unit which amount is defined in our partnership agreement as the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units these units are deemed subordinated because for a period of time referred to as the subordination period the subordinated units will not be entitled to receive any distributions until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages from prior quarters furthermore no arrearages will accrue or be payable on the subordinated units the practical effect of the subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that during the subordination period there will be available cash to be distributed on the common units subordination period         the subordination period began on the closing date of our initial public offering and except as described below will extend until the first business day following the distribution of available cash in respect of any quarter beginning with the quarter ending june   that each of the following tests are met  aggregate distributions of available cash from operating surplus on the outstanding common units subordinated units and any other outstanding units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units with respect to each of the three consecutive nonoverlapping fourquarter periods immediately preceding such date equaled or exceeded  the annualized minimum quarterly distribution on all outstanding common units and subordinated units and any other outstanding units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units in each case in respect of such periods  the adjusted operating surplus for each of the three consecutive nonoverlapping fourquarter periods immediately preceding such date equaled or exceeded  the annualized minimum quarterly distribution on all of the common units subordinated units and any other units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units that were outstanding during such periods on a fully diluted weighted average basis and  there are no arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units  table of contents expiration upon removal of the transocean member         in addition if the unitholders remove the transocean member other than for cause and no units held by the transocean member and its affiliates voted in favor of the removal  the subordinated units held by any person will immediately and automatically convert into common units on a oneforone basis  all cumulative common unit arrearages on the common units will be extinguished and the subordination period will end and  the holders of the incentive distribution rights currently the transocean member will have the right to convert their incentive distribution rights into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests expiration of the subordination period         when the subordination period ends upon satisfaction of the test described above or upon removal of the transocean member as described above each outstanding subordinated unit will convert into one common unit and will thereafter participate pro rata with the other common units in distributions of available cash adjusted operating surplus         adjusted operating surplus is intended to reflect the cash generated from operations during a particular period and therefore excludes net drawdowns of reserves of cash established in prior periods adjusted operating surplus for any period consists of  operating surplus generated with respect to that period excluding any amounts attributable to the item described in the first bullet point under the caption operating surplus and capital surplusoperating surplus above less  any net increase in working capital borrowings with respect to that period less  any net decrease in cash reserves for operating expenditures with respect to that period not relating to an operating expenditure made with respect to that period plus  any net decrease in working capital borrowings with respect to that period plus  any net increase in cash reserves for operating expenditures with respect to that period required by any debt instrument for the repayment of principal interest or premium plus  any net decrease made in subsequent periods to cash reserves for operating expenditures initially established with respect to that period to the extent such decrease results in a reduction in adjusted operating surplus in subsequent periods distributions of available cash from operating surplus during the subordination period         we make distributions of available cash from operating surplus for any quarter during the subordination period in the following manner  first  percent to the common unitholders pro rata until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter  second  percent to the common unitholders pro rata until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal to any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the subordination period  table of contents  third  percent to the subordinated unitholders pro rata until we distribute for each subordinated unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter and  thereafter in the manner described in incentive distribution rights below         the preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities distributions of available cash from operating surplus after the subordination period         we will make distributions of available cash from operating surplus for any quarter after the subordination period in the following manner  first  percent to all unitholders pro rata until we distribute for each outstanding unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter and  thereafter in the manner described in incentive distribution rights below         the preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities transocean member interest         the transocean member owns a transferrable noneconomic limited liability company interest in us which does not entitle it to receive cash distributions however the transocean member owns common units subordinated units and incentive distribution rights as further explained below in us and may in the future own other equity securities in us and is or will be entitled to receive distributions on any such interests incentive distribution rights         incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels have been achieved the transocean member currently holds the incentive distribution rights however the incentive distribution rights may be transferred separately from the transocean member interest any transfer by the transocean member of the incentive distribution rights would not change the percentage allocations of quarterly distributions with respect to such rights         if for any quarter  we have distributed available cash from operating surplus to the common and subordinated unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution and  we have distributed available cash from operating surplus on outstanding common units in an amount necessary to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution then we will distribute any additional available cash from operating surplus for that quarter among the unitholders in the following manner  first  percent to all unitholders pro rata until each unitholder receives a total of  per unit for that quarter the first target distribution  second  percent to all unitholders pro rata and  percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights pro rata until each unitholder receives a total of  per unit for that quarter the second target distribution  table of contents  third  percent to all unitholders pro rata and  percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights pro rata until each unitholder receives a total of  per unit for that quarter the third target distribution and  thereafter  percent to all unitholders pro rata and  percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights pro rata         in each case the amount of the target distribution set forth above is exclusive of any distributions to common unitholders to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution the percentage interests set forth above assume that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities notwithstanding the foregoing for any quarter in which the application of the formula above would result in the common unitholders receiving in the aggregate less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter then the distribution to the holders of the incentive distribution rights will be reduced pro rata to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate distribution to the common unitholders to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter percentage allocations of available cash from operating surplus         the following table illustrates the percentage allocations of the additional available cash from operating surplus among the unitholders and the holders of the incentive distribution rights up to the various target distribution levels the amounts set forth under marginal percentage interest in distributions are the percentage interests of the unitholders and the holders of the incentive distribution rights in any available cash from operating surplus we distribute up to and including the corresponding amount in the column total quarterly distribution

if any in the following manner  first  percent to all unitholders pro rata until the minimum quarterly distribution is reduced to zero as described below  second  percent to the common unitholders pro rata until we distribute for each common unit an amount of available cash from capital surplus equal to any unpaid arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units and  thereafter as if such distributions were from operating surplus  table of contents         the preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities effect of a distribution from capital surplus         our limited liability company agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as the repayment of the consideration for the issuance of the units which is a return of capital each time a distribution of capital surplus is made the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reduced in the same proportion as the distribution had to the fair market value of the common units prior to the announcement of the distribution because distributions of capital surplus will reduce the minimum quarterly distribution after any of these distributions are made it may be easier for the transocean member to receive incentive distributions and for the subordinated units to convert into common units however any distribution of capital surplus before the minimum quarterly distribution is reduced to zero cannot be applied to the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution or any arrearages         once we reduce the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels to zero we will then make all future distributions  percent to the holders of units and  percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights provided that for any fiscal quarter in which the application of our distribution formula would result in the holders of the common units receiving in the aggregate less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter then the distribution to the holders of the incentive distribution rights shall be reduced pro rata to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate distribution to the holders of the common units to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter adjustment to the minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels         in addition to adjusting the minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels to reflect a distribution of capital surplus if we combine our common units into fewer common units or subdivide our common units into a greater number of common units we will proportionately adjust  the minimum quarterly distribution  the target distribution levels  the initial unit price and  the arrearages per common unit in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units         for example if a twoforone split of the common units should occur the minimum quarterly distribution the target distribution levels and the initial unit price would each be reduced to  percent of its initial level if we combine our common units into a lesser number of units or subdivide our common units into a greater number of units we will combine our subordinated units or subdivide our subordinated units using the same ratio applied to the common units we will not make any adjustment by reason of the issuance of additional units for cash or property distributions of cash upon liquidation         if we dissolve in accordance with our limited liability company agreement we will sell or otherwise dispose of our assets in a process called liquidation we will apply the proceeds of liquidation in the manner set forth below  table of contents         if as of the date three trading days prior to the announcement of the proposed liquidation the average closing price for our common units for the preceding  trading days the current market price is greater than the sum of  any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the subordination period plus  the initial unit price less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection with a partial liquidation then the proceeds of the liquidation will be applied as follows  first  percent to the common unitholders pro rata until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal to the current market price of our common units  second  percent to the subordinated unitholders pro rata until we distribute for each subordinated unit an amount equal to the current market price of our common units and  thereafter  percent to all unitholders pro rata  percent to holders of incentive distribution rights         notwithstanding the foregoing if the application of the formula above would result in the common unitholders receiving in the aggregate less than a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation then the application of the proceeds of liquidation to the holders of the incentive distribution rights shall be reduced pro rata to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate application of the proceeds of liquidation to the common unitholders to represent a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation         if as of the date three trading days prior to the announcement of the proposed liquidation the current market price of our common units is equal to or less than the sum of  any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the subordination period plus  the initial unit price less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection with a partial liquidation then the proceeds of the liquidation will be applied as follows  first  percent to the common unitholders pro rata until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal to the initial unit price less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection with a partial liquidation  second  percent to the common unitholders pro rata until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal to any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the subordination period  third  percent to the subordinated unitholders until we distribute for each outstanding subordinated unit an amount equal to the initial unit price less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection with a partial liquidation and  thereafter  percent to all unitholders pro rata  percent to holders of incentive distribution rights         notwithstanding the foregoing if the application of the formula above would result in the common unitholders receiving in the aggregate less than a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation then the application of the proceeds of liquidation to the holders of the incentive distribution rights shall be reduced pro rata to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate application of the proceeds of liquidation to the common unitholders to represent a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation  table of contents         the immediately preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities selling security holder registration of securities held by transocean         pursuant to this prospectus transocean may offer and sell from time to time up to  common units which transocean acquired as part of the consideration for its contribution of certain assets to us in connection with our formation and initial public offering information about transocean is set forth herein and where applicable will be set forth in a prospectus supplement in a posteffective amendment or in filings we make with the sec under the exchange act that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus we are registering the securities for sale by transocean because transocean is an affiliate of ours and its ability to resell such securities under an exemption from registration such as rule  under the securities act is subject to limitations         the prospectus supplement for any offering of our common units by transocean will set forth the following information with respect to the selling security holder  the nature of any position office or other material relationship that the selling security holder has had within the last three years with us or any of our affiliates  the number of common units owned by the selling security holder prior to the offering  the amount of common units to be offered for the selling security holders account and  the amount and if one percent or more the percentage of common units to be owned by the selling security holder after the completion of the offering conflicts of interests and duties conflicts of interest         conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between the transocean member and its affiliates including transocean on the one hand and us and our unaffiliated members on the other hand our board of directors has a duty to manage us in a manner it believes is beneficial to us certain of our executive officers and directors are also directors andor officers of transocean or its affiliates and as such they owe fiduciary duties to transocean that may cause them to pursue business strategies that disproportionately benefit transocean or which otherwise are not in the best interests of us or our unitholders these officers have fiduciary duties to those entities and not to us as a result of these relationships conflicts of interest may arise between us and our unaffiliated members on the one hand and transocean and its other affiliates including the transocean member on the other hand our directors have duties to influence in our role as controlling owner the decisions made by the rigcos in a manner beneficial to us at the same time the directors and officers of the rigcos have a duty to act for the rigcos in a manner beneficial to all of the rigcos owners including transocean while we will have influence in our role as controlling owner of the rigcos the directors and officers of the rigcos will exercise decisions of the rigcos and they will have a duty to act in the best interests of the rigcos our board of directors may resolve conflicts of interest between transocean and us and to the extent acting in our role as the controlling owner of the rigcos has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict the resolution of these conflicts may not be in the best interest of us or our unitholders         our company affairs are governed by our limited liability company agreement and the marshall islands act the provisions of the marshall islands act resemble provisions of the limited liability company laws of a number of states in the united states most notably delaware we are not aware of any material difference in unitholder rights between the marshall islands act and the delaware  table of contents limited liability company act the marshall islands act also provides that it is to be applied and construed to make it uniform with the laws of the state of delaware and so long as it does not conflict with the marshall islands act or decisions of certain marshall islands courts the nonstatutory law or case law of the courts of the state of delaware is adopted as the law of the marshall islands there have been few if any court cases in the marshall islands interpreting the marshall islands act in contrast to delaware which has a fairly welldeveloped body of case law interpreting its limited liability company statute accordingly we cannot predict whether marshall islands courts would reach the same conclusions as courts in delaware for example the rights of our unitholders and responsibilities of the transocean member and its affiliates and our directors and our officers under marshall islands law are not as clearly established as under judicial precedent in existence in delaware due to the lessdeveloped nature of marshall islands law our public unitholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests or seeking remedies in the face of actions by the transocean member its affiliates and our directors and our officers or our controlling unitholders than would unitholders of a limited liability company organized in the united states         our limited liability company agreement contains provisions replacing the fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed by the transocean member and our directors and officers with contractual standards governing their duties and the methods of resolving conflicts of interest our limited liability company agreement also specifically defines the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by the transocean member or our directors or officers that without these defined liability standards might constitute breaches of those duties         our board of directors will not be in breach of its obligations under our limited liability company agreement or duties to us or the unitholders if the resolution of the conflict is  approved by the conflicts committee which our limited liability company agreement defines as special approval although our board of directors is not obligated to seek such approval  approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units excluding any common units owned by the transocean member or any of its affiliates although neither the transocean member nor our board of directors are obligated to seek such approval  determined by our board of directors to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties but our board of directors is not required to obtain confirmation to such effect from an independent third party or  determined by our board of directors to be fair and reasonable to us taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us         if our board of directors seeks or obtains approval from the conflicts committee then it will be presumed that in making its decision the conflicts committee acted in good faith and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company challenging such determination the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption if our board of directors does not seek or obtain approval from the conflicts committee or our unitholders and our board of directors determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in the third and fourth bullet points above then it will be presumed that in making its decision our board of directors including board members affected by the conflict acted in good faith and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company challenging such determination the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption unless the resolution of a conflict is specifically provided for in our limited liability company agreement our board of directors or the conflicts committee of our board of directors may consider any factors it determines in good faith to consider when resolving a conflict when our limited liability company  table of contents agreement requires someone to act in good faith it requires that person to subjectively believe that he is acting in a manner that is in or not adverse to the best interests of the company or that the determination to take or not to take action meets the specified standard for example a transaction on terms no less favorable to the us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or is fair and reasonable to us in taking such action such person may take into account the totality of the circumstances or the totality of the relationships between the parties involved including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us if that person has the required subjective belief then the decision or action will be conclusively deemed to be in good faith for all purposes under our limited liability company agreement         conflicts of interest could arise in the situations described below among others actions taken by our board of directors may affect the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders or accelerate the right to convert subordinated units         the amount of cash that is available for distribution to unitholders is affected by decisions of our board of directors regarding such matters as  the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales  cash expenditures  borrowings  estimates of maintenance and replacement capital expenditures  the issuance of additional units and  the creation reduction or increase of reserves in any quarter         our board of directors determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and whether a capital expenditure is classified as a maintenance and replacement capital expenditure which reduces operating surplus or an expansion capital expenditure which does not reduce operating surplus these determinations can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders and to the transocean member and the ability of the subordinated units to convert into common units         in addition our board of directors may use an amount initially equal to  million which would not otherwise constitute available cash from operating surplus in order to permit the payment of cash distributions on the units and incentive distribution rights all of these actions may affect the amount of cash distributed to our unitholders and the transocean member and may facilitate the conversion of subordinated units into common units         in addition borrowings by us and our affiliates do not constitute a breach of any duty owed by the transocean member or our directors or officers to our unitholders including borrowings that have the purpose or effect of  enabling the transocean member or its affiliates to receive distributions on any subordinated units held by them or the incentive distribution rights or  accelerating the expiration of the subordination period         for example in the event we have not generated sufficient cash from our operations to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our common units and our subordinated units our limited liability company agreement permits us to borrow funds which would enable us to make this distribution on all outstanding units please read provisions of our limited liability company agreement relating to cash distributionssubordination period  table of contents our limited liability company agreement provides that we and our subsidiaries may borrow funds from the transocean member and its affiliates         neither our limited liability company agreement nor any other agreement requires transocean to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets or dictates what markets to pursue or grow transoceans directors and executive officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of transocean which may be contrary to our interests         because certain of our executive officers and directors are also directors andor officers of transocean or its affiliates such officers and directors have fiduciary duties to transocean that may cause them to pursue business strategies that disproportionately benefit transocean or which otherwise are not in our best interests our officers face conflicts in the allocation of their time to our business         our officers who are employed by transocean and perform executive officer functions for us pursuant to agreements with transocean are not required to work fulltime on our affairs and also perform services for affiliates of transocean transocean conducts substantial businesses and activities of its own in which we have no economic interest as a result there could be material competition for the time and effort of our officers who also provide services to transocean which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we will reimburse the transocean member and its affiliates for expenses         pursuant to our limited liability company agreement we will reimburse the transocean member and its affiliates for costs and expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf our limited liability company agreement provides that our board of directors will determine the expenses that are allocable to us common unitholders will have no right to enforce obligations of transocean and its affiliates under agreements with us         no agreement between us on the one hand and transocean and its affiliates on the other will grant to the unitholders separate and apart from us the right to enforce the obligations of transocean and its affiliates in our favor contracts between us on the one hand and transocean and its affiliates on the other will not be the result of armslength negotiations         neither our limited liability company agreement nor any of the other agreements contracts and arrangements between us and transocean and its affiliates are or will be the result of armslength negotiations our limited liability company agreement generally provides that any affiliated transaction such as an agreement contract or arrangement between us and transocean and its affiliates that does not receive unitholder or conflicts committee approval must be  determined by our board of directors to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties but our board of directors is not required to obtain confirmation to such effect from an independent third party or  determined by our board of directors to be fair and reasonable to us taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us         affiliates of transocean which provides certain management and administrative services to us may also enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of its affiliates on our behalf however  table of contents there is no obligation of the transocean member and its affiliates to enter into any contracts of this kind common units are subject to the transocean members limited call right         the transocean member may exercise its right to purchase common units as provided in our limited liability company agreement or assign this right to one of its affiliates or to us free of any liability or obligation to us or our members the transocean member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion nor shall unitholders have dissenters rights of appraisal regarding the value of the common units to be purchased by the transocean member upon the exercise of this limited call right as a result a common unitholder may have common units purchased from the unitholder at an undesirable time or price please read our limited liability company agreementlimited call right we may choose not to retain separate counsel accountants or others for ourselves or for the holders of common units         the attorneys independent accountants and others who perform services for us have been retained by our board of directors attorneys independent accountants and others who perform services for us are selected by our board of directors or the conflicts committee and may perform services for transocean and its affiliates we may choose to retain separate counsel independent accountants or other service providers for ourselves or the holders of common units in the event of a conflict of interest between transocean and its affiliates on the one hand and us or the holders of common units on the other depending on the nature of the conflict we do not intend to do so in most cases except as provided in the omnibus agreement the transocean members affiliates including transocean may compete with us and neither the transocean member nor its affiliates nor our directors and officers have any obligation to present business opportunities to us         under the omnibus agreement transocean will not and will cause its controlled affiliates other than us our subsidiaries and any publicly traded affiliates of transocean not to for so long as transocean controls us to agree not to acquire own operate or contract for any drilling rig that was constructed in  or later and is operating under a contract for five or more years affiliates of the transocean member are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities including those that might be in direct competition with us furthermore the omnibus agreement does not prohibit transocean from forming a new publicly traded entity that will not be subject to the omnibus agreement and that may compete with us in addition under our limited liability company agreement the doctrine of corporate opportunity or any analogous doctrine will not apply to the transocean member its affiliates or our directors and officers as a result neither the transocean member nor any of its affiliates nor any of our directors and officers will have any obligation to present business opportunities to us other than as provided in the omnibus agreement duties         the duties owed to unitholders by the transocean member and its affiliates and our directors and officers are generally set forth in our limited liability company agreement the marshall islands act provides that marshall islands limited liability companies may in their limited liability company agreements expand or restrict the fiduciary duties owed by members or directors to the company or another member or director         in addition we and our subsidiaries have entered into two master services agreements and one or more support services or secondment agreements and may enter into additional agreements with transocean and certain of its subsidiaries in the performance of their obligations under these  table of contents agreements transocean and its subsidiaries are not held to a fiduciary standard of care but rather to the standards of care specified in the relevant agreement         as permitted by the marshall islands act our limited liability company agreement contains various provisions replacing any fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed by the transocean member or by our directors and officers with contractual standards governing the duties of the transocean member and our directors and officers and the methods of resolving conflicts of interest these provisions among other things allow the transocean member and our directors and officers to take into account the interests of other parties in addition to our interests when resolving conflicts of interest we believe this is appropriate and necessary because many of our directors and officers have fiduciary duties to transocean and its affiliates and might otherwise have fiduciary duties to our members as well without these provisions the transocean members and our directors and officers ability to make decisions involving conflicts of interest would be restricted we believe these provisions strengthen our ability to attract and retain experienced and capable directors and officers these provisions disadvantage the common unitholders because among other things they restrict the rights and remedies available to members for actions that without these provisions might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty as described below and permit the transocean member and our directors and officers to take into account the interests of third parties in addition to our interests when resolving conflicts of interest         the following is a summary of  the duties imposed on the transocean member and our directors and officers by the marshall islands act  material modifications of these duties contained in our limited liability company agreement and  certain rights and remedies of unitholders contained in our limited liability company agreement and the marshall islands act marshall islands law fiduciary duty standards         the marshall islands act does not specifically provide that members or directors or officers of limited liability companies have any statutory fiduciary duties because the marshall islands act provides that it is to be applied and construed to make it uniform with the laws of the state of delaware and so long as it does not conflict with the marshall islands act or decisions of certain marshall islands courts the nonstatutory law or case law of the courts of the state of delaware is adopted as the law of the marshall islands it is possible that in the absence of provisions in the limited liability company agreement to the contrary a marshall islands court or a court interpreting marshall islands law could determine that certain fiduciary duties would apply to the members and directors and officers of a marshall islands limited liability company in accordance with delaware case law limited liability company agreement modified standards         our limited liability company agreement contains provisions that permit or consent to conduct by the transocean member and its affiliates and our directors and officers that might otherwise raise issues as to compliance with fiduciary duties under the laws of the marshall islands for example our limited liability company agreement provides that to the extent permitted by law when the transocean member takes actions provided under our limited liability company agreement it may act without any fiduciary obligation to us or the unitholders whatsoever these provisions may restrict the obligations to which the transocean member and our directors and officers might otherwise be held our limited liability company agreement generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of  table of contents interest not involving a vote of unitholders and that are not approved by the conflicts committee of our board of directors must be  determined by our board of directors to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties but our board of directors is not required to obtain confirmation to such effect from an independent third party or  determined by our board of directors to be fair and reasonable to us taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us         if approval from the conflicts committee is sought then it will be presumed that in making its decision the conflicts committee acted in good faith and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company challenging such determination the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption if approval from the conflicts committee is not sought and our board of directors determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in the bullet points above then it will be presumed that in making its decision our board of directors acted in good faith and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption these standards may reduce the obligations to which our board of directors might otherwise be held         in addition to the other more specific provisions limiting the obligations of the transocean member and our directors and officers our limited liability company agreement further provides that the transocean member and our officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our members for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the transocean member or our officers or directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or in the case of a criminal matter acted with knowledge that conduct was unlawful however this limitation does not apply to any claims made under the federal securities laws rights and remedies of unitholders         the provisions of the marshall islands act resemble the provisions of the limited liability company act of delaware for example like delaware the marshall islands act favors the principles of freedom of contract and enforceability of limited liability company agreements and allows our limited liability company agreement to contain terms governing the rights of our unitholders the rights of our unitholders including voting and approval rights and the ability of the company to issue additional units are governed by the terms of our limited liability company agreement please read our limited liability company agreement         as to remedies of unitholders the marshall islands act generally provides that a member may institute legal action in the right of the company to recover a judgment in its favor if managers or members with the authority to do so have refused to institute the action or where an effort to cause those managers or members to do so is not likely to succeed in addition the statutory or case law of some jurisdictions may permit a member to institute legal action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated limited partners to recover damages from the board of directors for violations of its fiduciary duties to the members         by purchasing our common units each common unitholder will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by the provisions in our limited liability company agreement including the provisions discussed above please read description of the common unitstransfer of common units this is in accordance with the policy of the marshall islands act favoring the principle of freedom of contract and the enforceability of limited liability company agreements the failure of a member to sign our limited liability company agreement does not render our limited liability company agreement unenforceable against that person  table of contents         under our limited liability company agreement we must indemnify the transocean member and our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities costs and expenses incurred by the transocean member or these other persons we must provide this indemnification unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that these persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct we also must provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings except when the transocean member or these other persons acted with knowledge that their conduct was unlawful thus the transocean member and our directors and officers could among other things be indemnified for their negligent acts if they met the requirements set forth above to the extent that these provisions purport to include indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act of  as amended in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable please read our
