church is a member of the worldwide anglican communion with  million members in  countries as episcopalians and anglicans we are a community of christians bound together by shared faith and understanding  this faith comes from our belief that the bible contains the experience of gods call to restoration ultimately realized through jesus  our understanding of the bible grows out of reading studying and scholarship  this understanding comes out of the interpretation of the bible and the christian faith beginning with the writings from the earliest centures of the church on down to today  this is shaped too by our godgiven ability to think to question to explore to listen and to know that gods revelation is a living one scripture  tradition  reason are the three components in the process of understanding our call to serve god by serving others our faith is lived out through worshipping god making prayer a central part of our lives continuing to study in order to grow in the faith serving others both within the parish and out into the community by mission  outreach supporting the ministries by giving time energy  money related pages who we are clergy staff history
