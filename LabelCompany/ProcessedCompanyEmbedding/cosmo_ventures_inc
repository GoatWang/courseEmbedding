offering will not be used to pay mr ram for his services to the company whether provided prior to during or subsequent to the offering there can be no assurance that the company will raise any funds through this offering and if a limited amount of funds are raised the company will use such funds according to their best judgment in accordance with the “use of proceeds” chart this discretion is not unlimited and any such change in the use of proceeds as discussed above would be restricted to a proportionate reduction in funds allocated to each specific item listed and would not differ materially from the “use of proceeds” chart above to the extent our offering proceeds do not cover any professional fees incurred by the company we anticipate paying for any such expenses out of any additional funding or revenues we receive if we require additional funding we will seek such funds from management friends family and business acquaintances in order to continue our operations or we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility as with any form of financing there are uncertainties concerning the availability of such funds on terms acceptable to us as we have not received any firm commitments or indications of interest from our friends family members or business acquaintances regarding potential investments in our company the market for selling over stock items online is a relatively new yet growing industry we expect to compete with these other service providers principally on the bases of the quality of services we intend to offer customers and in our companys ability to acquire and retain personnel to market and sell our proposed services our company will also compete on the bases of service price our principal competitors include bidzcom overstockcom amazon and bluefly all of which offer services similar to our proposed services numerous other second tier resellers are entering into the marketplace consisting of independent marketing consultants who are reselling and not operating their own web and mobile platform we anticipate that most if not all of our competitors will initially have greater name and brand recognition and access to greater amounts of capital and established relationships with a larger base of current and potential customers because of their size and bargaining power our competitors may be able to purchase equipment supplies and services at lower prices than us in the initial stages of our development as a result our operations may be significantly and negatively impacted by our larger more established competitors once we commence phase  of our operations if we are not able to generate enough revenue by attracting new and existing businesses andor by enticing users to opt into our services we may be forced to cease operations our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on the quality of our services size of our database of optin endusers customer service as well as our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry these factors include the introduction of new services and technologies changes in consumer preferences demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors as a result of competition we may be required to  increase overall spending to ensure we are offering the best quality products and services to our customers  continually assess and evaluate our service plans and other offers to ensure that we are offering the most compelling and affordable products and services and  increase our advertising promotional spending commissions and other subscriber acquisition costs the industry has minimal and low cost barriers to entry and therefore it is a very competitive market we will face many large and small competitors in the ecommerce retail business including ebay amazon buycom shopcom and other similar websites easy entry does not necessarily mean that a new entrant can build a web presence traffic and customer base the cosmo ventures business model consists of selling the overstock of other wholesale retailers from india in north america merchandise we intend to offer on our site will be competitively priced to benefit our potential customers we believe an online business model is better positioned to succeed if it employs brandtraffic heaviest discounter reputation low cost operations and customer satisfaction we anticipate overstockcom and amazon ‘competitors’ to be our biggest competition although we will be a smaller independent online retailer one of our goals will be to attract our competitor’s clients to our business these two highly branded companies are well established with a worldwide presence our effort to compete with them shows the need for such companies and higher online consumer purchases our point of difference from our competition is our indian manufactured merchandise which we believe will be enough to turn over some loyal customers who seek a bargain over brand company description cosmo ventures inc was incorporated in the state of nevada on february   our mission is to provide
