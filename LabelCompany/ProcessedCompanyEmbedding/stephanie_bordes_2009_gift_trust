an exploration of mythology mixed with her personal symbolism her art journeys through surreal otherworlds populated by dreamlike figures masked creatures and winged shadows the fantastical permeates through the visions and you get a sense that this is a world that underlies our own when viewed with a desire for beauty and a shifted perception archetypes the basis for the universal appeal of mythological concepts are one of the defining inspirations for her imagery this is mingled with the movement of dance stephanie has been a dancer for almost two decades and she uses that experience of how the human body moves and emotes to create a bridge into her artwork so that not only do the humans dance across the page but the very branches of her trees seem to move with a sinuous grace and the arrangement of inanimate elements has a choreographed rhythm and flow growing up in california stephanie has been surrounded by the wealth of natural inspiration all around her the twisting boughs of live oaks from the hills near her home insinuate themselves into her paintings the chaos of natures wild growth and conversely the beauty of decay echo in the textures and fractal patterns of her work she began her illustration career working with many fantasy gaming companies early on she did pieces for wizards of the coast in magic the gathering and forgotten realms as well as with skotos tech castle marrach white wolf changeling alderac entertainment legend of five rings and green ronin blue rose she also worked with publishing companies luna bookstachyon books and palazzo editions in  she embarked on a more personal long term project of what eventually was released in  as the shadowscapes tarot by llewllyn publishing the tarot was an ideal melding of her fantasy experience with her desire for exploring archetypes and mythology since then she has worked with llewellyn publishing on other projects including an astrological calendar and an herbal guide she currently has a new deck in the works called the dreamdance oracle she is also known for her series of watercolor technique books dreamscapes published through impact books showing anyone how to pick up pencil and brush and embark on their own explorations into painting fantastic worlds and the creatures that inhabit them she exhibits original works with regular group shows at krab jab studio in seattle wa and solo shows and has been a part of group shows with galleries in san francisco nashville and san diego her work has also been included in the spectrum annual of fantastic art in for several years and at the spectrum showcase in september  at the society of illustrators in ny her recent work features insects imaginative plants and fae creatures interwoven into a miniature world that is often overlooked when size and physical permanence is equated with importance when not painting into the twilight hours she can be found dancing playing on her handpan or piano and introducing her six year old
