through fidelity summary overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds

rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment

table provides estimates of the funds distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes a return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income” the source of all distributions paid by the fund including net investment income is subject to change this is because the fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts reits and similar companies distributions from reits are attributed to various sources including net investment income capital gains and return of capital the estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the reit securities held by the fund the fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from gaap as a result distributions are subject to recharacterization for federal income tax purposes as the fund has a capital loss carryover any distribution paid to shareholders that exceeds the total of the fund’s investment company taxable income must be characterized as ordinary income up to the amount of the fund’s net capital gain realized during the calendar year this would cause a distribution that is classified as a return of capital under gaap to be reported as ordinary income for tax purposes the final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after yearend and reported to you on form div and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above form div which is mailed after the close of the calendar year will specify how the distributions paid by the fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return eg ordinary income return of capital and capital gain important information not fdic insured • may lose value • no bank guarantee leverage represented as a percentage of the fund’s managed assets as of the most recent month end leverage is created whenever a closedend fund has investment exposure in excess of its net assets the use of leverage is speculative and there are special risks and costs associated with leverage the use of leverage increases the volatility of the funds net asset value in both up and down markets the fund seeks to enhance its dividend yield through leverage but there is no guarantee that the funds leverage strategy will be successful   expense ratios as disclosed in the fund’s most recent annual report to stockholders dated december   expense ratios are net of waivers andor reimbursements portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice the mention of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation for any person to buy sell or hold any particular security  top ten holdings are determined on the basis of the value of

share is as of the prior day’s market close of regular trading on the nyse generally  pm eastern time on each day the nyse is open for trading distribution rate is calculated dividing the last distribution paid per share annualized by the market price note that the number of income distributions is based on the fund’s distribution payment frequency ie monthly or quarterly a fund may pay distributions in excess of its net investment company taxable income and to the extent this occurs the distribution yield quoted will include a return of capital the estimated return of capital for each distribution is also available on this web site by clicking on the distributions tab on each fund’s landing page sec yield is calculated by dividing annualized net investment income per share during a day period by the maximum offering price per share as of the close of that period sec yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities since certain distributions received by the funds from real estate investment trusts reits may consist of dividend income return of capital and capital gains and the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the year the sec yield has been adjusted for the funds that invest significantly in reits based on estimates of return of capital and capital gains quarterly distribution per share is as of the most recent quarter  end the fund pays regular quarterly cash distributions to common shareholders at a level rate that may be adjusted from time to time based on the projected income of the fund the amount of quarterly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors including changes in portfolio and market conditions each fund’s distributions reflect net investment income and may also include net realized capital gains andor return of capital return of capital includes distributions paid by a fund in excess of its net investment income and such excess is distributed from the fund’s assets under federal tax regulations some or all of the return of capital distributed by a fund may be taxed as ordinary income in addition distributions for funds investing in real estate investment trusts reits may later be characterized as capital gains andor a return of capital depending on the character of the dividends reported to each fund after yearend by reits held by a fund however please note that distributions are subject to recharacterization for tax purposes and the final tax treatment of these distributions will be reported to shareholders after the close of each fiscal year on form div risks of investing in real estate securities risks of investing in real estate securities are similar to those associated with direct investments in real estate including falling property values due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from economic legal political or technological developments lack of liquidity limited diversification and sensitivity to certain economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations lower liquidity political and economic uncertainties and differences in accounting standards some international securities may represent small and mediumsized companies which may be more susceptible to price volatility and less liquidity than larger companies risks of investing in preferred securities investing in any market exposes investors to risks in general the risks of investing in preferred securities are similar to those of investing in bonds including credit risk and interestrate risk as nearly all preferred securities have issuer call options call risk and reinvestment risk are also

estimates of the funds distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes a return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income” the source of all distributions paid by the fund including net investment income is subject to change this is because the fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts reits and similar companies distributions from reits are attributed to various sources including net investment income capital gains and return of capital the estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the reit securities held by the fund the fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from gaap  the final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after yearend and reported to you on form div and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above form div which is mailed after the close of the calendar year will specify how the distributions paid by the fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return eg ordinary income return of capital and capital gain important information not fdic insured • may lose value • no bank guarantee leverage represented as a percentage of the fund’s managed assets as of the most recent month end leverage is created whenever a closedend fund has investment exposure in excess of its net assets the use of leverage is speculative and there are special risks and costs associated with leverage the use of leverage increases the volatility of the funds net asset value in both up and down markets the fund seeks to enhance its dividend yield through leverage but there is no guarantee that the funds leverage strategy will be successful   expense ratios as disclosed in the fund’s most recent annual report to stockholders dated december   expense ratios are net of waivers andor reimbursements portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice the mention of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation for any person to buy sell or hold any particular security  top ten holdings are determined on the basis of the value of individual securities held the fund may also hold positions in other types of securities issued by the companies listed above you

for trading distribution rate is calculated dividing the last distribution paid per share annualized by the market price note that the number of income distributions is based on the fund’s distribution payment frequency ie monthly or quarterly a fund may pay distributions in excess of its net investment company taxable income and to the extent this occurs the distribution yield quoted will include a return of capital the estimated return of capital for each distribution is also available on this web site by clicking on the distributions tab on each fund’s landing page sec yield is calculated by dividing annualized net investment income per share during a day period by the maximum offering price per share as of the close of that period sec yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities since certain distributions received by the funds from real estate investment trusts reits may consist of dividend income return of capital and capital gains and the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the year the sec yield has been adjusted for the funds that invest significantly in reits based on estimates of return of capital and capital gains quarterly distribution per share is as of the most recent quarter  end the fund pays regular quarterly cash distributions to common shareholders at a level rate that may be adjusted from time to time based on the projected income of the fund the amount of quarterly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors including changes in portfolio and market conditions each fund’s distributions reflect net investment income and may also include net realized capital gains andor return of capital return of capital includes distributions paid by a fund in excess of its net investment income and such excess is distributed from the fund’s assets under federal tax regulations some or all of the return of capital distributed by a fund may be taxed as ordinary income in addition distributions for funds investing in real estate investment trusts reits may later be characterized as capital gains andor a return of capital depending on the character of the dividends reported to each fund after yearend by reits held by a fund however please note that distributions are subject to recharacterization for tax purposes and the final tax treatment of these distributions will be reported to shareholders after the close of each fiscal year on form div risks of investing in preferred securities investing in any market
