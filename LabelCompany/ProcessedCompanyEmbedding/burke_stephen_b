squarely in the geriatric oldmedia camp of disney viacom cbs st century fox and time warner all of which are struggling to varying degrees with the digital revolution and innovative upstarts like netflixbut comcast startled investors and analysts on wednesday with earnings that suggested there was still growth potential in old media not only did the cable giant stem the tide of socalled cord cutters by adding video subscribers but results from nbcuniversal were every bit as dazzling as the latest financials from amazon or google’s parent alphabetuniversal theme park revenue jumped  percent for the quarter and the movie business rose  percent over all nbcuniversal revenue rose more than  percent comcast doesn’t break out earnings for nbcuniversal but operating cash flow rose  percentsince  when comcast first bought a stake in nbcuniversal from its former parent general electric an acquisition completed five years ago nbcuniversal’s cash flow has doubled the nbc television network which had been in fourth place for so long seven years that many doubted it could be resurrected is the leading network for the coveted to age group powered by high ratings for “sunday night

recordbreaking revenue and three blockbusters — “jurassic world” “furious ” and “minions” — that topped  billion at the box office the universal theme parks long overshadowed by disney’s introduced the hugely popular harry potter attraction and have doubled revenue since  continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story i sat down this week with steve burke chief executive of nbcuniversal in his spacious lightfilled office at nbcuniversal’s headquarters at  rockefeller plaza despite the pressures of running a media giant with  billion in revenue he looks younger than his age of  years in our conversation one thing stood out about nbcuniversal which is true of all oldmedia companies it’s all about the people “this isn’t like manufacturing” mr burke said “it’s about talent if you get that wrong the whole enterprise goes bad very quickly”mr burke grew up in broadcast television — his father dan burke was a former president of capcities abc and steve burke worked at disney under the former chief executive michael eisner and then at comcast where he was president of the cable division under the chairman and chief executive brian roberts photo nbc is the leading network for the coveted to age group powered by high ratings for shows like “the voice” credit trae pattonnbc today much of mr burke’s time seems to be spent courting coaxing stroking cajoling — and in some cases ejecting — highpaid highprofile stars and executives many with outsize egos in  mr burke had to replace the prominent nbc sports head dick ebersol just four weeks before the rights to the sochi olympics were auctionedlast year when the nbc nightly news anchor brian williams acknowledged he fabricated details about his experiences covering combat in iraq mr burke had to put their close friendship aside and deliver an inperson ultimatum to take a sixmonth leave without pay “agonizing” mr burke told mehe flew to california and spent a weekend with jay leno to negotiate the delicate transition to jimmy fallon as host of the “tonight” show a year before mr leno’s contract was set to expirestill dealing with stars like mr leno and mr fallon can’t be delegated it was mr burke who coaxed steven spielberg back to his production roots at universal studios and some deals — nbc’s multibilliondollar nineyear extension of “sunday night football” for example — are so big they require the presence of mr roberts mr burke’s bosswhile mr burke comes across as genial and lowkey he’s a demanding boss of the  nbcuniversal executives mr burke inherited from ge only four remain advertisement continue reading the main story early in his tenure he summoned the top  managers to orlando and told them they had to do better “i had to be stern” mr burke said “people thought everything was fine it wasn’t i had to paint reality i ranked our top  businesses based on operating cash flow eight of the  were in the third quartile” meaning they woefully lagged their competitors he charged them to act like owners not renters — which means to invest for the long term to take responsibility and to fix problems themselves — a mantra now printed on the back of every nbcuniversal business card it’s also one emphasized by warren e buffett to the managers running the various businesses at his conglomerate berkshire hathaway where mr burke serves on the board disclosure i’m a weekly contributor to cnbc the nbcuniversalowned business channeltom williams chairman and chief executive of universal parks  resorts has been at universal for  years “the previous mentality was how can we take cash out of the business” mr williams said “comcast encouraged even mandated reinvestment we’ve had great success with creative concepts that have resonated with consumers steve and brian have said ‘keep reinvesting’ the returns are stellar” video talking of comcast and viacom james b stewart appearing on cnbc described the situation in viacom as king lear in the board room and also discussed strong earnings at comcast by cnbc on publish date february    watch in times video » embed universal recently acquired  percent ownership of universal studios japan is opening another harry potter attraction in hollywood and is building a new park in beijingwith nbcuniversal pretty much firing on all cylinders mr burke has been able to turn his attention to the digital revolution he said he was looking to hire digital talent had personally interviewed  people in the last month and would probably establish an nbcuniversal digital headquarters in santa monica also known as silicon beach the company has taken  million stakes in the digital media companies buzzfeed and vox media and has started seeso a digital comedy channel“it’s my biggest challenge” he said “big media made the transition from broadcast to cable but we were still dealing with channels now we have to move to digital digital is different the dna doesn’t already reside in the company”

showdown comcast stock trades at a pricetoearnings ratio of  netflix’s is  and amazon’s is  meaning that investors are anticipating much higher growth at those companiesstill as old and new media converge and talent increasingly rivals engineering prowess in importance it may be worth asking how much oldmedia dna resides in digital media giants like facebook amazon and alphabet mark zuckerberg mr bezos and larry page their respective chief executives aren’t primarily known for their people skills let alone the ability to cultivate hollywood celebrities and tv starsmr burke typically shuns the spotlight and insists that it is the reinvigorated culture and a deep bench that explains nbcuniversal’s recent success and momentum he said he was also aware that success in entertainment is often cyclicalstill it’s obvious that recent successes have fulfilled a lifelong goal “i’m a product of my dad’s influence at capcities abc my time at disney and then at comcast” mr burke said “i developed all these theories about how to run a big media company and i finally got an opportunity to try them” correction february   an earlier version of this column misstated mr burke’s title at

manage to pull in a full price buyer indeed as per your mama’s bejeweled abacus mister and missus burke are looking at a bank account brutalizing  loss not counting carrying costs improvement expenses and real estate fees money however doesn’t seem to be too much of an issue for mister and missus burke bless their financial hearts even though they’re looking at a hefty loss in philadelphia they still have the wherewithal to keep a huge spread in new york city—more on that later—and spend—as we also first heard from yolanda yakettyyak and confirmed with property records— on a newly built mansion in la’s brentwood area listing details described the white clapboardsided house as a “new england trad” that sits on almost a third of an acre in a discreet but decidedly affluent and—obviously—exceedingly expensive neighborhood and is conveniently located walking distance to the brentwood country mart the children will note that listing details and other reports show mister and missus burke’s row house in philly measures  square feet and listing details your mama turned up for their new house in los angeles shows it too has  square feet spooky or just a cute coinkydink you decide listing details your mama turned up show the colonialesque residence has a total of six bedrooms and  one of each of which is comprise a staff suite in the finished basement area the airy interior spaces were finished with furniture grade builtins quarter and rift sawn oak floors throughout and feature vaulted wood ceilings and marble bathrooms there are as is expected in a house of this size and price a foyer that will impress guests formal living and dining rooms and a woodpaneled library less formal family quarters include an large eatin kitchen with breakfast area separate mud room and an adjoining family room that opens to the backyard downstairs in the finished basement along with the staff bedroom and bathroom there’s a screening room with wet bar a wine room a powder room and a laundry room with dual washers and dryers probably handy for a family with five children the landscaped backyard has large terraces and patios one with a fire pit a builtin barbecue set up and a heated swimming pool and spa in new york city mister and missus burke own a large terraced apartment in the same arts and craftsy upper west side building where madonna lived in a meandering multiunit combo before she decamped to her triple wide townhouse on the upper east side the burke’s higher floor urban aerie is a combination of three apartments that property records and reports from the time show mister and missus burke purchased in separate transaction between early may and late july in  first they paid  million for a large and lovely if somewhat quirkily laid out four bedroom and three bathroom apartment with a slender ish foot long terrace with sweeping views over central park to fifth avenue quick on the heels of that came the  offmarket acquisition of the apartment next door—of unknown size—and shortly after that the spacecraving couple coughed up another  million for a third contiguous apartment with one bedroom and one bathroom a few quick tabulations on your mama’s bejeweled abacus reveals they spent a cool  to purchase the three apartments and we have to assume without knowledge or proof they’ve since spent a small fortune to combine them into one hopefully cohesive familyofsevensized sprawler as of today the combocrib is not listed on the open market but of course we don’t have any inside intel on the burke’s future plans for the

brentwood one but that is ok reply anonymous says january   at  am if you don’t like the bitch pass her by that’s what i do she misinforms and plagiarizes time’s to precious to waste it on reading insecure blather reply anonymous says january   at  pm not that you care or will believe me up there but i’m  and i can assure you i’m not the rabbi just another stater of the obvious if it’s so onerous around here for you why come around at all seriously why just to act like a spoiled  year old reply lil gay boy says january   at  pm east coast properties are impressive the west not so much… a pale awkward bulk our dear rebbe’s take is spot on funny how some commenters never actually comment on the topic but rather just the other commenters what’s that about nothing else to say reply anonymous says january   at  pm it is a beautiful street also along this street are the houses used in the sixth sense and my personal favorite from childhood trading places willlds reply wikipedia watch says january   at  pm hey rabbi  you insecure bitch writing your own anons again anyone past grade school knows about the thirteen colonies anyone with a kernel of culture is aware of philadelphia’s provenance yours is a relentless cycle of stating the obvious team wikihack dept reply anonymous says january   at  pm thank you bentley and anonymous for your support i enjoy and learn from your observations bentley and wish – no pressure – that you would comment more frequently sincerelyhedda reply anonymous says january   at  am personally i like philly the few times ive been there a manageable city with great squares cultural opportunity and national history the townhouse is a bit traditional for me but it’s beautifully done ps hey you up there…at least the rabbi contributes to the conversation instead of whining like a punk ass bitch if you think the rabbi’s third person reveals insecurity what do you think your anonymous sniping about herhim reveal about you nothing pretty or secure or intelligent that’s for sure team rabbi reply bentley says january   at  am anon  – the rabbi provides a great deal of insight and information about the content on this site and does so in what i find to be an engaging and compelling manner don’t like what she has to say skip it dude nobody likes a bully especially a cyberbully who represent the nadir of the bullying world and it’s a shitty world you want to be that guy the townhouse odd that there is no service staircase reply anonymous says january   at  am  your rabbi comment is perfect that third person arrogance is insecurity i’m not her fucking kinderlach either i love your mama but i can’t stomach that bitch’s comments reply anonymous says january   at  pm seriousness reply anonymous says january   at  pm in all seriously though rabbi you sound like a fucking idiot stop referring to yourself in the third person you aren’t nearly important enough to merit such a reference get over yourself you fucking loser reply anonymous says january   at  pm shavua tovgood week to mama the kinderlach and anonymous january th at  pm beautiful georgian and federal townhomes were built in philadelphia and baltimore and extraordinary fine furniture was manufactured in both cities early philadelphia “trinity” houses each consisted of three stories one room and fireplace per floor with an enclosed tightlywinding staircase costlier houses such as the burke home each included a side corridor and open staircase with two rooms and two fireplaces per story both types of homes were later expanded into their gardens in england during the midth century thomas chippendale published a book of furniture design the chippendale style combined gothic and rococo elements was copied throughout the  colonies and achieved its finest form in philadelphia the largest city within the colonies the kinderlach might take a peek at the winterthur museum blackwell parlor to have a look at high living in prerevolutionary philadelphia after independence us architects and cabinet designers looked to the ancient democracy of greece and the new democracy of france for inspiration the rabbi’s familiarity of philadelphia is personal as she has been privileged to enjoy the interiors of many of the city’s privately restored homes while her knowledge of baltimore is limited to the artistry of john waters and his associates rabbi hedda la casa reply mariya sharapova says january   at  pm this comment has been removed by the author reply mariya sharapova says january   at  am this comment has been removed by the author reply anonymous says january   at  am i love philly it’s a great town i wholeheartedly agree with the rabbi on the townhouse bargains to be found there believe it or not baltimore also has some really wonderful old townhomes steeped in history as wellback in the day some of the finest furniture makers and craftsmen around were found in each of those towns reply anonymous says january   at  am oops “dikduk” the autocorrect was incorrect hedda reply anonymous says january   at  am confidential to anonymous  pm the rabbi encourages you to check your spelling and dilduk hebrew grammar she understands your recommendation to close her mouth while observing that you completely misspelled one word omitted the letter “hey” in two words and employed an article incorrectly the rabbi wishes you a good shabbos most religiously yoursrabbi hedda lacasa reply anonymous says january   at  pm … tistom et ape you unimaginative bore of a goy knock off the gentile rabbi shtick you also attempt so pathetically i am an insulted jew reply anonymous says january   at  pm much to our chagrin seriously mama this site has gone from downhill to being swallowed up into a ditch and crushed by fallen boulders no one gives a fuck about philadelphia reply sandpiper says january   at  am the philadelphia townhouse exudes perfection such a dignified body of work surely created by the finest architects and craftspeople of that opulent era peeked the neighborhood it’s a silver slipper district all the way on melding the three units at harperley hall i wonder if the sticker shock lessened by way of a healthy signing bonus for his new york promotion and relocation it happens reply cristian dcruze says january   at  am wow what a wonderful house excellent look and nice structure the plan used to make this house is really fantastic and shows the talent of the builder i have also bought a beautiful property in almeria which consists of all these new settings along with wonderful views surrounding it anyone can buy it for their family and can live with all happiness but your house is really incredible and it can give all the comfort for a family i like your post and i ll tell this to my friend who was looking for this type of property so thank you for sharing this with us keep it up reply anonymous says january   at  am the rittenhouse square townhome is absolutely beautiful philadelphia is the last truly great city where one can still purchase a lovely townhouse usually of the federal era on a quiet block in a very picturesque neighborhood perhaps in society hill or old city adjacent to downtown for under one million dollars one simply needs to discard the old saw “first prize a week in philadelphia second prize two weeks in philadelphia” the city of brotherly love has more parkland per capita than any other us city a spectacular fine art museum housed in the largest greek temple edifice in the world music theater sports and a thriving lgbt community harperley hall at  central park west is also wonderful the apartments have beautiful woodwork and hardwood floors fireplaces balcony views of the park and juxtaposition to lincoln center alas that the brentwood home while probably containing the best of everything appears to be entirely predictable rabbi hedda lacasa reply anonymous says january   at
