plan a stable value fund is designed as a lowrisk investment but you could still lose money by investing in it the primary risks of investing in the fund are credit risk the chance that an issuer will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner credit risk should be low for the fund because it invests mainly in investments that are considered highquality event risk the chance that a synthetic or traditional contract issuer will pay participant benefits at a value less than book value because of the occurrence of an event or condition which is outside the normal operation of the plan for example layoffs plan amendments sale of a division participant withdrawals due to the plan sponsor’s insolvency or bankruptcy due to the diversification of plans participating in the fund event risk is low income risk the possibility that a fund’s income will decline as a result of falling interest rates investments are generally made for terms of at least two to five years on average producing a rate of fund income that will be higher than that earned on shortermaturity money market funds but because it is influenced by average interest rates over a period of several years the fund’s income yield may remain above or stay below current market yields during some time periods income risk will be moderately high for the fund inflation risk the chance that fund returns will not keep pace with the cost of living inflation risk will be moderate for the fund market risk the chance that the fund’s price per share will change as a result of movements in market interest rates resulting in gains or losses on investments made in the fund the risk is minimized by investing primarily in investment contracts that enable the fund under present accounting standards to value its
