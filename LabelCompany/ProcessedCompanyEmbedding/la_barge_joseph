missouri river during his fiftyyear career he never lost a boat labarges career on the river mirrored the rise and decline of the steamboat industry as interstate river commerce grew until it was eclipsed by the emerging railroad industry early years and education    joseph labarge joseph labarge this image shows joseph labarge as a young man history of early steamboat navigation on the

children josephs parents personified the cultural diversity of early st louis his father a french canadian immigrated to st louis in  and worked as a fur trader his mother was the daughter of a spanish military attaché who served as secretary to the last two spanish lieutenant governors of the upper louisiana territory the steamer yellowstone the steamer yellowstone this illustration by

brandon k ruud  page  shs ref  b joseph grew up on a farm on the outskirts of north st louis at school he learned to speak english as his family spoke french the primary language used in the upper louisiana territory during his youth he spent three years as a student at st marys college in perry county missouri before leaving at the age of fifteen to begin working bored with his job as a store clerk he joined the crew of the steamboat yellowstone as a clerk the following spring labarge signed a contract with the american fur company to work as a clerk for  for three years he once again boarded the yellowstone and traveled up the missouri river to council bluffs iowa and spent the next few years working in the western fur trade the age of the steamboat    map of fur trading posts map of fur trading posts this map shows the location of fur trading posts located along the missouri river labarge and other mountain steamboat pilots traveled from st louis missouri up the river as far as presentday montana to deliver items on behalf of the american fur company one of the most powerful and influential fur companies of its time courtesy of the national park service when overtrapping led to the decline of beavers in the eastern united states merchants fur traders and fur trappers like manuel lisa and the chouteau family of st louis expanded west up the missouri river in search of new unexploited beaver populations trading posts sprang up along the river in what is now south dakota north dakota and montana native americans brought beaver pelts and buffalo hides to exchange for goods like guns blankets and cloth while fur traders dropped off their furs to be shipped to st louis for market and picked up supplies the fastest way to ship furs and travel from the upper missouri region to st louis was to travel by steamboat a new form of transportation developed in the early s as the transcontinental railroad did not exist yet prior to the steamboat travelers used a variety of boats such as canoes keelboats mackinaws and bullboats to go up and down the river these boats were powered by man wind or river current whereas a steamboat is powered by a steam engine and propelled forward by paddlewheels mounted on the rear or sides of the boat watching the cargo watching the cargo the painting watching the cargo by famed artist george caleb bingham depicts crew members guarding the cargo of a steamboat seen in the distance which has hit a snag the state historical society of missouri art collection  prior to channeling in the twentieth century the missouri river was not very deep so steamboats were designed with a long broad hull for operating in shallow water and had multiple decks with a pilot house on top the pilot house is where the boats wheel used to steer the boat was located the pilot stood at the wheel watching the river ahead ready to steer the boat away from any obstacles steamboats required lots of wood to fuel the fire needed to create steam to power the boats engine steamboats with paddlewheels mounted on the back were called sternwheelers while those with paddlewheels on the sides of the boat were known as sidewheelers the captain managed the business affairs of the boat while the pilot was responsible for navigation some captains also served as pilots others did not captain labarge did both mark twain who grew up on the mississippi river in hannibal idolized steamboat pilots writing a pilot in those days was the only unfettered and entirely independent human being that lived in the earth danger on the river    snags snags swiss artist karl bodmer accompanied german prince maximilian alexander philipp of wiedneuwied on an expedition up the missouri river bodmer painted and sketched the natural landscape and the animals that inhabited it he was one of the first artists to bring accurate colorful images of the american west to american and european audiencesthis image depicts the dangers that sunken trees also known as snags presented to steamboats pilots relied on memory nerve and skill to keep their boats from harm karl bodmers north american prints edited by brandon k ruud  page  shs ref  b steamboat pilots like labarge confronted a variety of problems on the river submerged trees gravel bars ice violent thunderstorms and even attacks by native americans if a boat became snagged on a tree or other obstruction it could be lost pilots constantly watched for anything that could damage the boat and carefully navigated sharp bends swift rapids and other boats over time an experienced pilot memorized the river but floods and high water continually reshaped it creating new obstacles mother nature however was not the only source of concern for steamboat crews both steamboat passengers and crew members had to worry about mechanical problems the most serious of which was a boiler explosion    explosion of the saluda explosion of the saluda traveling on a steamboat came with its share of dangers on april   the steamboat saluda suffered a catastrophic boiler explosion on the missouri river near lexington missouri this is an artists rendering of what the explosion may have looked like the state historical society of missouri photograph collection  in  the steamboat saluda suffered a catastrophic boiler explosion as it left lexington missouri dozens of passengers were killed including labarges brother and brotherinlaw who were working as pilots on the saluda fire was another worry because they were made of wood boats could be set on fire and destroyed by a misplaced cigar or spark after the passage of the steamboat act of  the federal government began regulating the steamboat industry to help prevent passenger deaths from accidents such as fires collisions and explosions captains and pilots had to earn their licenses which could be revoked for safety violations steamboat pilot pilots license pilots license this is a photograph of joseph labarges steamboat license from  licenses could be revoked or suspended for a variety of things such as faulty equipment reckless behavior drunkenness and sleeping on duty e b trail collection  c the state historical society of missouri manuscript collectioncolumbia labarges first experience piloting a steamboat occurred in  when passengers on the yellowstone became ill with cholera many of the passengers and crew died including the pilot engineer and fireman the boats captain returned to st louis to hire a new crew leaving labarge in command when settlers living near the river heard that the yellowstone had experienced a cholera outbreak they threatened to burn the steamboat unless it was moved away from their settlement without any assistance labarge fired up the boilers and moved the boat upstream away from harm after his contract with the american fur company ended labarge began working on steamboats fulltime in various positions and developed a reputation as a skilled pilot    john james audubon john james audubon this is a portrait of famed naturalist john james audubon who became famous with the publication of his celebrated book birds of america in  audubon traveled up the missouri river to document animals he had not yet seen the resulting book was the viviparous quadrupeds of north america audubon was one of many celebrities that labarge met during his fiftyyear career on the missouri river courtesy of the white house historical association on august   labarge married pelagie guerette the couple had seven children together five boys and two girls the following year la barge served as pilot of the steamboat omega among the passengers was distinguished naturalist and artist john j audubon who was on his final trip west to study and document american wildlife by  boat traffic on the missouri river was growing as steamboats now carried not just furs and supplies but also artists settlers missionaries native americans miners explorers slaves scientists and fur traders leading some to call it the highway of the plains some of the steamboats that carried passengers became more luxurious while others remained devoted to hauling cargo in  labarge purchased his first steamboat the general brooks for —the rough equivalent of over half a million dollars today he sold it the next year and built a new steamboat the martha over the years labarge owned or leased a number of boats    steamboat log steamboat log some steamboat pilots relied on more than memory and skill edmund gray was a steamboat captain on the mississippi river he recorded detailed observations of the river and steering directions in a ledger that is called a pilots log edmund gray papers  c the state historical society of missouri manuscript collectioncolumbia like many steamboat captains labarge often contracted with the american fur company to transport passengers and freight up the river other times he worked for the federal government or even chose to work for himself no matter the job labarge met a wide variety of people on board his boat in  labarge piloted the steamboat st ange up the missouri to fort union with father pierre de smet a famous catholic missionary as one of his passengers that same year at the age of thirtysix labarge decided to retire his retirement was shortlived however and he had the honor of transporting abraham lincoln not yet president on one of his boats during lincolns  visit to council bluffs iowa in  labarge and some partners founded labarge harkness  company whose main rival was the american fur company civil war years    transporting rebels transporting rebels even the steamboat trade was not immune from the civil war st louis triweekly republican october   page  during the civil war captain labarge remained loyal to the union on one occasion his life was threatened when a group of southern sympathizers traveling on labarges steamboat cheered for confederate president jefferson davis while leaving st joseph for leavenworth kansas thinking labarge was disloyal a group of leavenworth residents threatened to hang him when the steamboat arrived but he was warned in time by his friend alexander majors one of the cofounders of the pony express de smet de smetthe de smet pictured at fort benton montana was built for captain labarge in  after he sold his steamboat emilie labarge the de smet was  feet long and  feet wide it later

and his steamboat at boonville and forced him to transport sterling price another confederate general who was ill to lexington missouri the episode got labarge into trouble with union authorities but he continued to operate on the river for the rest of the war in  labarge who was piloting his boat the emilie encountered an american fur company boat the spread eagle the two raced to see which boat could go the fastest when the captain of the spread eagle discovered he was going to lose he rammed his boat into the emilie angered by such reckless action labarge threatened to shoot the other captain unless he stopped his engines which he promptly did the emilie was badly damaged and the captain of the spread eagle later lost his pilots license due to his irresponsible behavior    emilie labarge emilie labarge this photograph shows steamboats along the waterfront in st louis one of them is the emilie labarge one of many steamboats that joseph labarge built and piloted during his career it was the second boat named after his daughter emilie the first was simply known as emilie james t thorp scrapbooks  c the state historical society of missouri manuscript collectioncolumbia the following year labarge contracted with the federal government to transport goods promised to native americans upriver to fort pierre dakota territory upon arrival the government officials in charge of distribution did not give the sioux indians all of their goods angered by the agents deception the sioux followed labarges steamboat over six hundred miles shooting at passengers at a place called tobacco garden in what is now north dakota  sioux waited to ambush the boat but were repelled by the crew the remaining goods were stored in an american fur company warehouse at fort union dakota territory and were to be picked up the next year by labarge when he returned to pick up the goods labarge discovered the american fur company had sold them leaving him with a  loss within a short period labarge harkness  company went out of business leaving labarge  in debt end of an era    railroads in  railroads in  this map illustrates the growth and expansion of railroads across the united states by  after  railroads quickly became the primary method of passenger and freight transportation in america steamboats continued to operate but in much smaller numbers each year american railroads their growth and development by association of american railroads  labarge continued to work as a captain and pilot but by the s the golden age of the steamboat was over in  the first transcontinental railroad in the united states was completed connecting council bluffs iowa to san francisco california a new era of transportation began as additional rail lines were built stretching like a spider web across america and making crosscountry travel faster and easier companies could ship freight between cities and states much more quickly and reliably than ever before for less money
