injunction against acts of unfair competition and also brought suit for a permanent injunction damages and payment of jpy  billion alleging violation of the unfair competition prevention act among other things the lawsuit states “update on status of thirdparty investment in the memory business” that wd has continually interfered with the bid process related to the sale of tmc citing joint venture agreements between toshiba and sandisk llc including its affiliates sandisk the lawsuit also says that wd has exaggerated its consent right – in both public statements and private communications to bidders and others involved in the sale process – in order to interfere with the sale of tmc which does not hold the ownership interests in joint venture companies coowned with sandisk the complaint goes on to state that proceeding with the sales process for tmc does not violate any consent rights held by wd wd’s claims are false designed only to interfere with the sale process and have damaged toshiba and tmc toshiba and tmc have filed litigation in japan because wd has improperly obtained toshiba and tmc’s trade secrets by transferring employees of sandisk to wd

disposition order seeking an injunction to put an end to wd’s damaging actions and a suit seeking permanent injunction and damages in addition to intentionally interfering with the tmc sale process

computer data storage company and one of the largest computer hard disk drive manufacturers in the world along with seagate technology western digital corporation has a long history in the electronics industry as an integrated circuit maker and a storage products company western digital was founded on april   by alvin b phillips a motorola employee as general digital initially and briefly a manufacturer of mos test equipment it rapidly became a speciality semiconductor maker with startup capital provided by several individual investors and industrial giant emerson electric around july  it adopted its current name and soon introduced its first product the wda uart contents  history  s  s  s  s  s  locations  products  hard drives  software  parallel ata hard disk drives  consumer products  lawsuits  issues  see also  references  external links historyedit sedit initially financed with startup capital provided by investors and emerson electric company wdc made its money by selling calculator chips through the early years of the s and by  wdc was the largest independent calculator chip maker in the world the oil crisis of the mids and the bankruptcy of its biggest calculator customer bowmar instrument changed its fortunes however and in  western digital declared chapter  bankruptcy after this emerson withdrew their support of the company and wdc was on its own wdc introduced several landmark products during this time including the mcp multichip microcoded cpu the mcp was used to implement decs lsi system and their own pascal microengine microcomputer which ran the ucsd psystem version iii and ucsd pascal the processor was also used in several singlechip floppy disk drive controller chips notably the fd however the wd integrated circuit that arguably drove westerns forward integration was the  chip the first disk drive formattercontroller replacing boards of ttl logic despite a price far higher than average cmos chips of the time it was very successful and extremely profitable sedit the fd and its kin were wdcs first entry into the data storage industry by the early s they were making hard disk drive controllers and in  they won the contract to provide ibm with controllers for the pcat that controller the wd became the basis of the ata interface which wdc developed along with compaq and control data corporations mpi division now owned by seagate technology starting in  throughout most of the s the family of controllers based on the wd provided the bulk of wdcs revenues and profits and for a time generated enormous corporate growth western digital paradise vga card bit isa bus circa  much of the midtolate s saw an effort by wdc to use the profits from their ata storage controllers to become a generalpurpose oem hardware supplier for the pc industry as a result wdc purchased a number of hardware companies these included graphics cards through its paradise subsidiary purchased  which became western digital imaging core logic chipsets by purchasing faraday electronics inc in  scsi controller chips for disk and tape devices by purchasing adsi in  networking wd wd ethernet and wds starlan they did well especially paradise which produced one of the best vga cards of the era but storagerelated chips and disk controllers were their biggest money makers in  they introduced the wdc singlechip scsi interface which was used in the first bit bus mastering scsi host adapter the wd fasst in  they introduced the wdc a singlechip implementation of the pcats floppy disk controller circuitry and the grandfather of modern super io chips in  they introduced the wdc vanilla the first singlechip ata hard disk controller  also brought what would be the biggest change in wdcs history that year wdc bought the hard drive production assets of pc hardware maker tandon the first products of that union under wdcs own name were the centaur series of ata and xt attachment drivescitation needed sedit western digital tidbit  wdah   mb  inch drive mounted in  inch adapter bracket western digital caviar  mb model number wdac from a series of hdds for desktop pcs it is a inch hdd mounted onto a inch adapter bracket by  things were starting to slow down as the pc industry moved from st and esdi drives to ata and scsi and thus were buying fewer hard disk controller boards that year saw the rise of wdcs caviar drives brand new designs that used the latest in embedded servo and computerized diagnostic systems eventually the successful sales of the caviar drives resulted in wdc starting to sell some of its divisions paradise was sold to philips and since disappeared its networking and floppy drive controller divisions went to smc networks and its scsi chip business went to future domain which was later bought out by market leader adaptec around  the technological lead that the caviar drives had enjoyed was eclipsed by newer offerings from other companies especially quantum corp and wdc fell into a slump products and ideas of this time did not go far the portfolio drive a inch  mm form factor model developed with jt storage was a flop as was the sdx hard disk to cdrom interface wdcs drives started to slip further behind competing products and quality began to suffer system builders and pc enthusiasts who used to recommend wd above all else were going to the competition particularly maxtor whose products had improved significantly by the late s in an attempt to turn the tide in  wdc recruited the help of ibm this agreement gave wdc the rights to use certain ibm technologies including giant magnetoresistive gmr heads and access to ibm production facilities the result was the expert line of drives introduced in early  the idea worked and wdc regained respect in the press and among users even despite a recall in  which was due to bad motor driver chips wdc later broke ties to ibm sedit western digital wdgd  gb raptor a  rpm inch hdd in  western digital became the first manufacturer to offer mainstream ata hard disk drives with  mib of disk buffer at that time most desktop hard disk drives had  mb of buffer wdc labeled these  mb models as special edition and distinguished them with the jb code the  mb models had the bb code the first  mb cache drive was the  gb wdjb followed by other models starting with  gb capacity wdc advertised the jb models for costeffective file servers in october  wd restated its prior year results to reflect the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no and the reclassification of connex and sanavigator results as discontinued operations in  wd acquired most of the assets of bankrupt onetime market leading magnetic hard drive readwrite head developer readrite corporation in the same year wd offered the first  rpm serial ata hdd the wdgd raptor with a capacity of  gb and an average access time of less than six milliseconds soon the  gb wdgd followed which was also much quieter in  western digital

version with a transparent window enabling the user to see the drives heads move over the platters while the drive read and wrote data as of update the wd raptor drives have a fiveyear warranty making them a more attractive choice for inexpensive storage servers where a large number of drives in constant use increases the likelihood of a drive failure in  western digital introduced its my book line of mass market external hard drives that feature a compact booklike design on october   western digital released several editions of a single  tb hard drive the largest in its my book line in  western digital acquired magnetic media maker komag also in the same year western digital adopted perpendicular recording technology in its line of notebook and desktop drives this allowed it to produce notebook and desktop drives in the largest classes of the time western digital also started to produce the energy efficient gp green power range of drives notable for their very low power consumption and heat dissipation but surprisingly good performance in  western digital announced the wd gp drive touting rotational speed between  and  rpm which if potentially misleading is technically correct the drive spins at  rpm and the green power spin speed is not variable wd gp drives are programmed to unload the heads whenever idle for a very short period of time many linux installations write to the file system a few times a minute in the background as a result there may be  or more load cycles per hour and the  load cycles rating of a wd gp drive may be exceeded in less than a year two thirdgeneration  tb velociraptors in icepack mounting frames on april   western digital announced the next generation of its  rpm sata wd raptor series of hard drives the new drives called wd

passport ultra hard drives once the user plugs it in a computer where wd smartware is installed this software backs up all documents pictures movies emails and more on the drive and continually checks for changes to drive locations this means that regular backup takes place the software appears to detect particular hard drives brand and differs western digital hard drives from another hard drives a similar way to seagates seatools software however as of june  one can no longer use a boot disc to test a modern wd drive independently of an operating system in the explanatory note on its support

western digital and often abbreviated as wdc or wd is an american computer data storage company and one of the largest computer hard disk drive manufacturers in the world along with seagate technology western digital corporation has a long history in the electronics industry as an integrated circuit maker and a storage products company western digital was founded on april   by alvin b phillips a motorola employee as general digital initially and briefly a manufacturer of mos test equipment it rapidly became a speciality semiconductor maker with startup capital provided by several individual investors and industrial giant emerson electric around july  it adopted its current name and soon introduced its first product the wda uart contents  history  s  s  s  s  s  locations  products  hard drives  software  parallel ata hard disk drives  consumer products  lawsuits  issues  see also  references  external links historyedit sedit initially financed with startup capital provided by investors and emerson electric company wdc made its money by selling calculator chips through the early years of the s and by  wdc was the largest independent calculator chip maker in the world the oil crisis of the mids and the bankruptcy of its biggest calculator customer bowmar instrument changed its fortunes however and in  western digital declared chapter  bankruptcy after this emerson withdrew their support of the company and wdc was on its own wdc introduced several landmark products during this time including the mcp multichip microcoded cpu the mcp was used to implement decs lsi system and their own pascal microengine microcomputer which ran the ucsd psystem version iii and ucsd pascal the processor was also used in several singlechip floppy disk drive controller chips notably the fd however the wd integrated circuit that arguably drove westerns forward integration was the  chip the first disk drive formattercontroller replacing boards of ttl logic despite a price far higher than average cmos chips of the time it was very successful and extremely profitable sedit the fd and its kin were wdcs first entry into the data storage industry by the early s they were making hard disk drive controllers and in  they won the contract to provide ibm with controllers for the pcat that controller the wd became the basis of the ata interface which wdc developed along with compaq and control data corporations mpi division now owned by seagate technology starting in  throughout most of the s the family of controllers based on the wd provided the bulk of wdcs revenues and profits and for a time generated enormous corporate growth western digital paradise vga card bit isa bus circa  much of the midtolate s saw an effort by wdc to use the profits from their ata storage controllers to become a generalpurpose oem hardware supplier for the pc industry as a result wdc purchased a number of hardware companies these included graphics cards through its paradise subsidiary purchased  which became western digital imaging core logic chipsets by purchasing faraday electronics inc in  scsi controller chips for disk and tape devices by purchasing adsi in  networking wd wd ethernet and wds starlan they did well especially paradise which produced one of the best vga cards of the era but storagerelated chips and disk controllers were their biggest money makers in  they introduced the wdc singlechip scsi interface which was used in the first bit bus mastering scsi host adapter the wd fasst in  they introduced the wdc a singlechip implementation of the pcats floppy disk controller circuitry and the grandfather of modern super io chips in  they introduced the wdc vanilla the first singlechip ata hard disk controller  also brought what would be the biggest change in wdcs history that year wdc bought the hard drive production assets of pc hardware maker tandon the first products of that union under wdcs own name were the centaur series of ata and xt attachment drivescitation needed sedit western digital tidbit  wdah   mb  inch drive mounted in  inch adapter bracket western digital caviar  mb model number wdac from a series of hdds for desktop pcs it is a inch hdd mounted onto a inch adapter bracket by  things were starting to slow down as the pc industry moved from st and esdi drives to ata and scsi and thus were buying fewer hard disk controller boards that year saw the rise of wdcs caviar drives brand new designs that used the latest in embedded servo and computerized diagnostic systems eventually the successful sales of the caviar drives resulted in wdc starting to sell some of its divisions paradise was sold to philips and since disappeared its networking and floppy drive controller divisions went to smc networks and its scsi chip business went to future domain which was later bought out by market leader adaptec around  the technological lead that the caviar drives had enjoyed was eclipsed by newer offerings from other companies especially quantum corp and wdc fell into a slump products and ideas of this time did not go far the portfolio drive a inch  mm form factor model developed with jt storage was a flop as was the sdx hard disk to cdrom interface wdcs drives started to slip further behind competing products and quality began to suffer system builders and pc enthusiasts who used to recommend wd above all else were going to the competition particularly maxtor whose products had improved significantly by the late s in an attempt to turn the tide in  wdc recruited the help of ibm this agreement gave wdc the rights to use certain ibm technologies including giant magnetoresistive gmr heads and access to ibm production facilities the result was the expert line of drives introduced in early  the idea worked and wdc regained respect in the press and among users even despite a recall in  which was due to bad motor driver chips wdc later broke ties to ibm sedit western digital wdgd  gb raptor a  rpm inch hdd in  western digital became the first manufacturer to offer mainstream ata hard disk drives with  mib of disk buffer at that time most desktop hard disk drives had  mb of buffer wdc labeled these  mb models as special edition and distinguished them with the jb code the  mb models had the bb code the first  mb cache drive was the  gb wdjb followed by other models starting with  gb capacity wdc advertised the jb models for costeffective file servers in october  wd restated its prior year results to reflect the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no and the reclassification of connex and sanavigator results as discontinued operations in  wd acquired most of the assets of bankrupt onetime market leading magnetic hard drive readwrite head developer readrite corporation in the same year wd offered the first  rpm serial ata hdd the wdgd raptor with a capacity of  gb and an average access time of less than six milliseconds soon the  gb wdgd followed which was also much quieter in  western digital redesigned its logo for the first time since  with the design of new logo focusing on the companys initials wd in  western digital released the  gb version the wd which was also available in a special version with a transparent window enabling the user to see the drives heads move over the platters while the drive read and wrote data as of update the wd raptor drives have a fiveyear warranty making them a more attractive choice for inexpensive storage servers where a large number of drives in constant use increases the likelihood of a drive failure in  western digital introduced its my book line of mass market external hard drives that feature a compact booklike design on october   western digital released several editions of a single  tb hard drive the largest in its my book line in  western digital acquired magnetic media maker komag also in the same year western digital adopted perpendicular recording technology in its line of notebook and desktop drives this allowed it to produce notebook and desktop drives in the largest classes of the time western digital also started to produce the energy efficient gp green power range of drives notable for their very low power consumption and heat dissipation but surprisingly good performance in  western digital announced the wd gp drive touting rotational speed between  and  rpm which if potentially misleading is technically correct the drive spins at  rpm and the green power spin speed is not variable wd gp drives are programmed to unload the heads whenever idle for a very short period of time many linux installations write to the file system a few times a minute in the background as a result there may be  or more load cycles per hour and the  load cycles rating of a wd gp drive may be exceeded in less than a year two thirdgeneration  tb velociraptors in icepack mounting frames on april   western digital announced the next generation of its  rpm sata wd raptor series of hard drives the new drives called wd velociraptor featured  gb capacity and inch  mm platters enclosed in the icepack a inch  mm mounting frame with a builtin heat sink western digital said that the new drives are  percent faster than the previous generation on september   western digital shipped a  gb inch  mm notebook hard drive which is part of their scorpio blue series of notebook hard drives on january   western digital shipped the first  tb internal hard disk drive on march   wdc entered the solidstate drive market with the acquisition of siliconsystems inc on july   western digital announced the first  tb mobile hard disk drive which shipped as both a passport series portable usb drive as well as a scorpio blue series notebook drive sedit in april  western digital acquired the magnetic glass media sputtering operations of hoya corporation and hoya magnetics singapore pte ltd homs while western digital had previously acquired other magnetic glass media sputtering operations the purchase of homs gave western digital an edge in its striving to produce highend hard disk drives using magnetic glass media by  there were three surviving independent hdd glass media manufacturing plants namely showa denko fuji electric and hoya magneticscitation needed in october  western digital announced the first  tb internal hard disk drive in march  western digital agreed to acquire the storage unit of hitachi hitachi global storage technologies for about  billion of which  billion was paid in cash and the rest with  million shares of western digital on october   western digitals thailand plant suspended operation in relation to the  thailand floods this caused a shortage of hard drives supplied by western digital pc manufacturers noted of the issue with apple ceo tim cook stating that he was expecting an overall industry shortage of disk drives a dell spokesperson also stated they were working with our hard drive suppliers to address potential impact for the remainder of the year despite this western digitals profits increased following the increase of hdd prices western digital red  tb a nasoptimized inch sata hdd in march  western digital completed the acquisition of hitachi global storage technologies and became the largest traditional hard drive manufacturer in the world to address the requirements of regulatory agencies in may  wdc divested to toshiba assets to manufacture and sell inch hard drives for the desktop and consumer electronics markets in july  western digital announced a red series of drives designed for networkattached storage nas devices this

november  western digital announced a  tb internal hard disk drive a inch  rpm drive belonging to the black series on january   timothy martin leyden announced wd would invest us  million to expand in thailand operations resumed in thailand after it recovered from damage during the  floods in november  western digital through its hgst subsidiary showed off new heliumfilled  tb ultrastar he hard disk drives when compared to regular airfilled hdds they claim  of reduction in power usage per terabyte of storage in february  western digital announced a new purple line of hard disk drives for use in video surveillance systems with capacities from  to  tb they feature internal optimizations for applications that involve nearconstant disk writing and allframe technology which is designed to reduce write errors this line was later expanded to include  and  tb models in september  western digitals hgst division introduced new heliumfilled  tb  tb and  tb hdds out of which the  tb variant also utilizes shingled magnetic recording smr in december  western digital acquired skyera a flashbased storage development company integrating the newly acquired company into its hgst division in may  western digital redesigned the my passport ultra series of portable hard disk drives adding a  tb storage option later in  wdc also launched the wd blue series of solidstate hybrid drives with a  tb

pcats floppy disk controller circuitry and the grandfather of modern super io chips in  they introduced the wdc vanilla the first singlechip ata hard disk controller  also brought what would be the

controller boards that year saw the rise of wdcs caviar drives brand new designs that used the latest in embedded servo and computerized diagnostic systems eventually the successful sales of the caviar drives resulted in wdc starting to sell some of its divisions paradise was sold to philips and since disappeared its networking and floppy drive controller divisions went to smc networks and its scsi chip business went to future domain which was later bought out by market leader adaptec around  the technological lead that the caviar drives had enjoyed was eclipsed by newer offerings from other companies especially quantum corp and wdc fell into a slump products and ideas of this time did not go far the portfolio drive a inch  mm form factor model developed with jt storage was a flop as was the sdx hard disk to cdrom interface wdcs drives started to slip further behind competing products and quality began to suffer system builders and pc enthusiasts who used to recommend wd above all else were going to the competition particularly maxtor whose products had improved significantly by the late s in an attempt to turn the tide in  wdc recruited the help of ibm this agreement gave wdc the rights to use certain ibm technologies including giant magnetoresistive gmr heads and access to ibm production facilities the result was the expert line of drives introduced in early  the idea

also available in a special version with a transparent window enabling the user to see the drives heads move over the platters while the drive read and wrote data as of update the wd raptor drives have a fiveyear warranty making them a more attractive choice for inexpensive storage servers where a large number of drives in constant use increases the likelihood of a drive failure in  western digital introduced its my book line of mass market external hard drives that feature a compact booklike design on october   western digital released several editions of a single  tb hard drive the

their very low power consumption and heat dissipation but surprisingly good performance in  western digital announced the wd gp drive touting rotational speed between  and  rpm which if potentially misleading is technically correct the drive spins at  rpm and the green power spin speed is not variable wd gp drives are programmed to unload the heads whenever idle for a very short period of time many linux installations write to the file system a few times a minute in the background as a result there may be  or more load cycles per hour and the  load cycles rating of a wd gp drive may be

western digital and often abbreviated as wdc or wd is an american computer data storage company and one of the largest computer hard disk drive manufacturers in the world along with seagate technology western digital corporation has a long history in the electronics industry as an integrated circuit maker and a storage products company western digital was founded on april   by alvin b phillips a motorola employee as general digital initially and briefly a manufacturer of mos test equipment it rapidly became a speciality semiconductor maker with startup capital provided by several individual investors and industrial giant emerson electric around july  it adopted its current name and soon introduced its first product the wda uart contents  history  s  s  s  s  s  locations  products  hard drives  software  parallel ata hard disk drives  consumer products  lawsuits  issues  see also  references  external links historyedit sedit initially financed with startup capital provided by investors and emerson electric company wdc made its money by selling calculator chips through the early years of the s and by  wdc was the largest independent calculator chip maker in the world the oil crisis of the mids and the bankruptcy of its biggest calculator customer bowmar instrument changed its fortunes however and in  western digital declared chapter  bankruptcy after this emerson withdrew their support of the company and wdc was on its own wdc introduced several landmark products during this time including the mcp multichip microcoded cpu the mcp was used to implement decs lsi system and their own pascal microengine microcomputer which ran the ucsd psystem version iii and ucsd pascal the processor was also used in several singlechip floppy disk drive controller chips notably the fd however the wd integrated circuit that arguably drove westerns forward integration was the  chip the first disk drive formattercontroller replacing boards of ttl logic despite a price far higher than average cmos chips of the time it was very successful and extremely profitable sedit the fd and its kin were wdcs first entry into the data storage industry by the early s they were making hard disk drive controllers and in  they won the contract to provide ibm with controllers for the pcat that controller the wd became the basis of the ata interface which wdc developed along with compaq and control data corporations mpi division now owned by seagate technology starting in  throughout most of the s the family of controllers based on the wd provided the bulk of wdcs revenues and profits and for a time generated enormous corporate growth western digital paradise vga card bit isa bus circa  much of the midtolate s saw an effort by wdc to use the profits from their ata storage controllers to become a generalpurpose oem hardware supplier for the pc industry as a result wdc purchased a number of hardware companies these included graphics cards through its paradise subsidiary purchased  which became western digital imaging core logic chipsets by purchasing faraday electronics inc in  scsi controller chips for disk and tape devices by purchasing adsi in  networking wd wd ethernet and wds starlan they did well especially paradise which produced one of the best vga cards of the era but storagerelated chips and disk controllers were their biggest money makers in  they introduced the wdc singlechip scsi interface which was used in the first bit bus mastering scsi host adapter the wd fasst in  they introduced the wdc a singlechip implementation of the pcats floppy disk controller circuitry and the grandfather of modern super io chips in  they introduced the wdc vanilla the first singlechip ata hard disk controller  also brought what would be the biggest change in wdcs history that year wdc bought the hard drive production assets of pc hardware maker tandon the first products of that union under wdcs own name were the centaur series of ata and xt attachment drivescitation needed sedit western digital tidbit  wdah   mb  inch drive mounted in  inch adapter bracket western digital caviar  mb model number wdac from a series of hdds for desktop pcs it is a inch hdd mounted onto a inch adapter bracket by  things were starting to slow down as the pc industry moved from st and esdi drives to ata and scsi and thus were buying fewer hard disk controller boards that year saw the rise of wdcs caviar drives brand new designs that used the latest in embedded servo and computerized diagnostic systems eventually the successful sales of the caviar drives resulted in wdc starting to sell some of its divisions paradise was sold to philips and since disappeared its networking and floppy drive controller divisions went to smc networks and its scsi chip business went to future domain which was later bought out by market leader adaptec around  the technological lead that the caviar drives had enjoyed was eclipsed by newer offerings from other companies especially quantum corp and wdc fell into a slump products and ideas of this time did not go far the portfolio drive a inch  mm form factor model developed with jt storage was a flop as was the sdx hard disk to cdrom interface wdcs drives started to slip further behind competing products and quality began to suffer system builders and pc enthusiasts who used to recommend wd above all else were going to the competition particularly maxtor whose products had improved significantly by the late s in an attempt to turn the tide in  wdc recruited the help of ibm this agreement gave wdc the rights to use certain ibm technologies including giant magnetoresistive gmr heads and access to ibm production facilities the result was the expert line of drives introduced in early  the idea worked and wdc regained respect in the press and among users even despite a recall in  which was due to bad motor driver chips wdc later broke ties to ibm sedit western digital wdgd  gb raptor a  rpm inch hdd in  western digital became the first manufacturer to offer mainstream ata hard disk drives with  mib of disk buffer at that time most desktop hard disk drives had  mb of buffer wdc labeled these  mb models as special edition and distinguished them with the jb code the  mb models had the bb code the first  mb cache drive was the  gb wdjb followed by other models starting with  gb capacity wdc advertised the jb models for costeffective file servers in october  wd restated its prior year results to reflect the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no and the reclassification of connex and sanavigator results as discontinued operations in  wd acquired most of the assets of bankrupt onetime market leading magnetic hard drive readwrite head developer readrite corporation in the same year wd offered the first  rpm serial ata hdd the wdgd raptor with a capacity of  gb and an average access time of less than six milliseconds soon the  gb wdgd followed which was also much quieter in  western digital redesigned its logo for the first time since  with the design of new logo focusing on the companys initials wd in  western digital released the  gb version the wd which was also available in a special version with a transparent window enabling the user to see the drives heads move over the platters while the drive read and wrote data as of update the wd raptor drives have a fiveyear warranty making them a more attractive choice for inexpensive storage servers where a large number of drives in constant use increases the likelihood of a drive failure in  western digital introduced its my book line of mass market external hard drives that feature a compact booklike design on october   western digital released several editions of a single  tb hard drive the largest in its my book line in  western digital acquired magnetic media maker komag also in the same year western digital adopted perpendicular recording technology in its line of notebook and desktop drives this allowed it to produce notebook and desktop drives in the largest classes of the time western digital also started to produce the energy efficient gp green power range of drives notable for their very low power consumption and heat dissipation but surprisingly good performance in  western digital announced the wd gp drive touting rotational speed between  and  rpm which if potentially misleading is technically correct the drive spins at  rpm and the green power spin speed is not variable wd gp drives are programmed to unload the heads whenever idle for a very short period of time many linux installations write to the file system a few times a minute in the background as a result there may be  or more load cycles per hour and the  load cycles rating of a wd gp drive may be exceeded in less than a year two thirdgeneration  tb velociraptors in icepack mounting frames on april   western digital announced the next generation of its  rpm sata wd raptor series of hard drives the new drives called wd velociraptor featured  gb capacity and inch  mm platters enclosed in the icepack a inch  mm mounting frame with a builtin heat sink western digital said that the new drives are  percent faster than the previous generation on september   western digital shipped a  gb inch  mm notebook hard drive which is part of their scorpio blue series of notebook hard drives on january   western digital shipped the first  tb internal hard disk drive on march   wdc entered the solidstate drive market with the acquisition of siliconsystems inc on july   western digital announced the

is an american computer data storage company and one of the largest computer hard disk drive manufacturers in the world along with seagate technology western digital corporation has a long history in the electronics industry as an integrated circuit maker and a storage products company western digital was founded on april   by alvin b phillips a motorola employee as general digital initially and briefly a manufacturer of mos test equipment it rapidly became a speciality semiconductor maker with startup capital provided by several individual investors and industrial giant emerson electric around july  it adopted its current name and soon introduced its first product the wda uart contents  history  s  s  s  s  s  locations  products  hard drives  software  parallel ata hard disk drives  consumer products  lawsuits  issues  see also  references  external links historyedit sedit initially financed with startup capital provided by investors and emerson electric company wdc made its money by selling calculator chips through the early years of the s and by  wdc was the largest independent calculator chip maker in the world the oil crisis of the mids and the bankruptcy of its biggest calculator customer bowmar instrument changed its fortunes however and in  western digital declared chapter  bankruptcy after this emerson withdrew their support of the company and wdc was on its own wdc introduced several landmark products during this time including the mcp multichip microcoded cpu the mcp was used to implement decs lsi system and their own pascal microengine microcomputer which ran the ucsd psystem version iii and ucsd pascal the processor was also used in several singlechip floppy disk drive controller chips notably the fd however the wd integrated circuit that arguably drove westerns forward integration was the  chip the first disk drive formattercontroller replacing boards of ttl logic despite a price far higher than average cmos chips of the time it was very successful and extremely profitable sedit the fd and its kin were wdcs first entry into the data storage industry by the early s they were making hard disk drive controllers and in  they won the contract to provide ibm with controllers for the pcat that controller the wd became the basis of the ata interface which wdc developed along with compaq and control data corporations mpi division now owned by seagate technology starting in  throughout most of the s the family of controllers based on the wd provided the bulk of wdcs revenues and profits and for a time generated enormous corporate growth western digital paradise vga card bit isa bus circa  much of the midtolate s saw an effort by wdc to use the profits from their ata storage controllers to become a generalpurpose oem hardware supplier for the pc industry as a result wdc purchased a number of hardware companies these included graphics cards through its paradise subsidiary purchased  which became western digital imaging core logic chipsets by purchasing faraday electronics inc in  scsi controller chips for disk and tape devices by purchasing adsi in  networking wd wd ethernet and wds starlan they did well especially paradise which produced one of the best vga cards of the era but storagerelated chips and disk controllers were their biggest money makers in  they introduced the wdc singlechip scsi interface which was used in the first bit bus mastering scsi host adapter the wd fasst in  they introduced the wdc a singlechip implementation of the pcats floppy disk controller circuitry and the grandfather of modern super io chips in  they introduced the wdc vanilla the first singlechip ata hard disk controller  also brought what would be the biggest change in wdcs history that year wdc bought the hard drive production assets of pc hardware maker tandon the first products of that union under wdcs own name were the centaur series of ata and xt attachment drivescitation

onto a inch adapter bracket by  things were starting to slow down as the pc industry moved from st and esdi drives to ata and scsi and thus were buying fewer hard disk controller boards that year saw the rise of wdcs caviar drives brand new designs that used the latest in embedded servo and computerized diagnostic systems eventually the successful sales of the caviar drives resulted in wdc starting to sell some of its divisions paradise was sold to philips and since disappeared its networking and floppy drive controller divisions went to smc networks and its scsi chip business went to future domain which was later bought out by market leader adaptec around  the technological lead that the caviar drives had enjoyed was eclipsed by newer offerings from other companies especially quantum corp and wdc fell into a slump products and ideas of this time did not go far the portfolio drive a inch  mm form factor model developed with jt storage was a flop as was the sdx hard disk to cdrom interface wdcs drives started to slip further behind competing products and quality began to suffer system builders and pc enthusiasts who used to recommend wd above all else were going to the competition particularly maxtor whose products had improved significantly by the late s in an attempt to turn the tide in  wdc recruited the help of ibm this agreement gave wdc the rights to use certain ibm technologies including giant magnetoresistive gmr heads and access to ibm production facilities the result was the expert line of drives introduced in early  the idea worked and wdc regained respect in the press and among users even despite a recall in  which was due to bad motor driver chips wdc later broke ties to ibm sedit western digital wdgd  gb raptor a  rpm inch hdd in  western digital became the first manufacturer to offer mainstream ata hard disk drives with  mib of disk buffer at that time most desktop hard disk drives had  mb of buffer wdc labeled these  mb models as special edition and distinguished them with the jb code the  mb models had the bb code the first  mb cache drive was the  gb wdjb followed by other models starting with  gb capacity wdc advertised the jb models for costeffective file servers in october  wd restated its prior year results to reflect the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no and the reclassification of connex and sanavigator results as discontinued operations in  wd acquired most of the assets of bankrupt onetime market leading magnetic hard drive readwrite head developer readrite corporation in the same year wd offered the first  rpm serial ata hdd the wdgd raptor with a capacity of  gb and an average access time of less than six milliseconds soon the  gb wdgd followed which was also much quieter in  western digital redesigned its logo for the first time since  with the design of new logo focusing on the companys initials wd in  western digital released the  gb version the wd which was also available in a special version with a transparent window enabling the user to see the drives heads move over the platters while the drive read and wrote data as of update the wd raptor drives have a fiveyear warranty making them a more attractive choice for inexpensive storage servers where a large number of drives in constant use increases the likelihood of a drive failure in  western digital introduced its my book line of mass market external hard drives that feature a compact booklike design on october   western digital released several editions of a single  tb hard drive the largest in its my book line in  western digital acquired magnetic media maker komag also in the same year western digital adopted perpendicular recording technology in its line of notebook and desktop drives this allowed it to produce notebook and desktop drives in the largest classes of the time western digital also started to produce the energy efficient gp green power range of drives notable for their very low power consumption and heat dissipation but surprisingly good performance in  western digital announced the wd gp drive touting rotational speed between  and  rpm which if potentially misleading is technically correct the drive spins at  rpm and the green power spin speed is not variable wd gp drives are programmed to unload the heads whenever idle for a very short period of time many linux installations write to the file system a few times a minute in the background as a result there may be  or more load cycles per hour and the  load cycles rating of a wd gp drive may be exceeded in less than a year two thirdgeneration  tb velociraptors in icepack mounting frames on april   western digital announced the next generation of its  rpm sata wd raptor series of hard drives the new drives called wd velociraptor featured  gb capacity and inch  mm platters enclosed in the icepack a inch  mm mounting frame with a builtin heat sink western digital said that the new drives

wwwwdccom western digital corporation commonly referred to as western digital and often abbreviated as wdc or wd is an american computer data storage company and one of the largest computer hard disk drive manufacturers in the world along with seagate technology western digital corporation has a long history in the electronics industry as an integrated circuit maker and a storage products company western digital was founded on april   by alvin b phillips a motorola employee as general digital initially and briefly a manufacturer of mos test equipment it rapidly became a speciality semiconductor maker with startup capital provided by several individual investors and industrial giant emerson electric around july  it adopted its current name and soon introduced its first product the wda uart contents  history  s  s  s  s  s  locations  products  hard drives  software  parallel ata hard disk drives  consumer products  lawsuits  issues  see also  references  external links historyedit sedit initially financed with startup capital provided by investors and emerson electric company wdc made its money by selling calculator chips through the early years of the s and by  wdc was the largest independent calculator chip maker in the world the oil crisis of the mids and the bankruptcy of its biggest calculator customer bowmar instrument changed its fortunes however and in  western digital declared chapter  bankruptcy after this emerson withdrew their support of the company and wdc was on its own wdc introduced several landmark products during this time including the mcp multichip microcoded cpu the mcp was used to implement decs lsi system and their own pascal microengine microcomputer which ran the ucsd psystem version iii and ucsd pascal the processor was also used in several singlechip floppy disk drive controller chips notably the fd however the wd integrated circuit that arguably drove westerns forward integration was the  chip the first disk drive formattercontroller replacing boards of ttl logic despite a price far higher than average cmos chips of the time it was very successful and extremely profitable sedit the fd and its kin were wdcs first entry into the data storage industry by the early s they were making hard disk drive controllers and in  they won the contract to provide ibm with controllers for the pcat that controller the wd became the basis of the ata interface which wdc developed along with compaq and control data corporations mpi division now owned by seagate technology starting in  throughout most of the s the family of controllers based on the wd provided the bulk of wdcs revenues and profits and for a time generated enormous corporate growth western digital paradise vga card bit isa bus circa  much of the midtolate s saw an effort by wdc to use the profits from their ata storage controllers to become a generalpurpose oem hardware supplier for the pc industry as a result wdc purchased a number of hardware companies these included graphics cards through its paradise subsidiary purchased  which became western digital imaging core logic chipsets by purchasing faraday electronics inc in  scsi controller chips for disk and tape devices by purchasing adsi in  networking wd wd ethernet and wds starlan they did well especially paradise which produced one of the best vga cards of the era but storagerelated chips and disk controllers were their biggest money makers in  they introduced the wdc singlechip scsi interface which was used in the first bit bus mastering scsi host adapter the wd fasst in  they introduced the wdc a singlechip implementation of the pcats floppy disk controller circuitry and the grandfather of modern super io chips in  they introduced the wdc vanilla the first singlechip ata hard disk controller  also brought what would be the biggest change in wdcs history that year wdc bought the hard drive production assets of pc hardware maker tandon the first products of that union under wdcs own name were the centaur series of ata and xt attachment drivescitation needed sedit western digital tidbit  wdah   mb  inch drive mounted in  inch adapter bracket western digital caviar  mb model number wdac from a series of hdds for desktop pcs it is a inch hdd mounted onto a inch adapter bracket by  things were starting to slow down as the pc industry moved from st and esdi drives to ata and scsi and thus were buying fewer hard disk controller boards that year saw the rise of wdcs caviar drives brand new designs that used the latest in embedded servo and computerized diagnostic systems eventually the successful sales of the caviar drives resulted in wdc starting to sell some of its divisions paradise was sold to philips and since disappeared its networking and floppy drive controller divisions went to smc networks and its scsi chip business went to future domain which was later bought out by market leader adaptec around  the technological lead that the caviar drives had enjoyed was eclipsed by newer offerings from other companies especially quantum corp and wdc fell into a slump products and ideas of this time did not go far the portfolio drive a inch  mm form factor model developed with jt storage was a flop as was the sdx hard disk to cdrom interface wdcs drives started to slip further behind competing products and quality began to suffer system builders and pc enthusiasts who used to recommend wd above all else were going to the competition particularly maxtor whose products had improved significantly by the late s in an attempt to turn the tide in  wdc recruited the help of ibm this agreement gave wdc the rights to use certain ibm technologies including giant magnetoresistive gmr heads and access to ibm production facilities the result was the expert line of drives introduced in early  the idea worked and wdc regained respect in the press and among users even despite a recall in  which was due to bad motor driver chips wdc later broke ties to ibm sedit western digital wdgd  gb raptor a  rpm inch hdd in  western digital became the first manufacturer to offer mainstream ata hard disk drives with  mib of disk buffer at that time most desktop hard disk drives had  mb of buffer wdc labeled these  mb models as special edition and distinguished them with the jb code the  mb models had the bb code the first  mb cache drive was the  gb wdjb followed by other models starting with  gb capacity wdc advertised the jb models for costeffective file servers in october  wd restated its prior year results to reflect the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no and the reclassification of connex and sanavigator results as discontinued operations in  wd acquired most of the assets of bankrupt onetime market leading magnetic hard drive readwrite head developer readrite corporation in the same year wd offered the first  rpm serial ata hdd the wdgd raptor with a capacity of  gb and an average access time of less than six milliseconds soon the  gb wdgd followed which was also much quieter in  western digital redesigned its logo for the first time since  with the design of new logo focusing on the companys initials wd in  western digital released the  gb version the wd which was also available in a special version with a transparent window enabling the user to see the drives heads move over the platters while the drive read and wrote data as of update the wd raptor drives have a fiveyear warranty making them a more attractive choice for inexpensive storage servers where a large number of drives in constant use increases the likelihood of a drive failure in  western digital introduced its my book line of mass market external hard drives that feature a compact booklike design on october   western digital released several editions of a single  tb hard drive the largest in its my book line in  western digital acquired magnetic media maker komag also in the same year western digital adopted perpendicular recording technology in its line of notebook and desktop drives this allowed it to produce notebook and desktop drives in the largest classes of the time western digital also started to produce the energy efficient gp green power range of drives notable for their very low power consumption and heat dissipation but surprisingly good performance in  western digital announced the wd gp drive touting rotational speed between  and  rpm which if potentially misleading is technically correct the drive spins at  rpm and the green power spin speed is not variable wd gp drives are programmed to unload the heads whenever idle for a very short period of time many linux installations write to the file system a few times a minute in the background as a result there may be  or more load cycles per hour and the  load cycles rating of a wd gp drive may be exceeded in less than a year two thirdgeneration  tb velociraptors in icepack mounting frames on april   western digital announced the next generation of its  rpm sata wd raptor series of hard drives the new drives called wd velociraptor featured  gb capacity and inch  mm platters enclosed in the icepack a inch  mm mounting frame with a builtin heat sink western digital said that the new drives are  percent faster than the previous generation on september   western digital shipped a  gb inch  mm notebook hard drive which is part of their scorpio blue series of notebook hard drives on january   western digital shipped the first  tb internal hard disk drive on march   wdc entered the solidstate drive market with the acquisition of siliconsystems inc on july   western digital announced the first  tb mobile hard disk drive which shipped as both a passport series portable usb drive as well as a scorpio blue series notebook drive sedit in april  western digital acquired the magnetic glass media sputtering operations of hoya corporation and hoya magnetics singapore pte ltd homs while western digital had previously acquired other magnetic glass media sputtering operations the purchase of homs gave western digital an edge in its striving to produce highend hard disk drives using magnetic glass media by  there were three surviving independent hdd glass media manufacturing plants namely showa denko fuji electric and hoya magneticscitation needed in october  western digital announced the first  tb internal hard disk drive in march  western digital agreed to acquire the storage unit of hitachi hitachi global storage technologies for about  billion of which  billion was paid in cash and the rest with  million shares of western digital on october   western digitals thailand plant suspended operation in relation to the  thailand floods this caused a shortage of hard drives supplied by western digital pc manufacturers noted of the issue with apple ceo tim cook stating that he was expecting an overall industry shortage of disk drives a dell spokesperson also stated they were working with our hard drive suppliers to address potential impact for the remainder of the year despite this western digitals profits increased following the increase of hdd prices western digital red  tb a

digital through its hgst subsidiary showed off new heliumfilled  tb ultrastar he hard disk drives when compared to regular airfilled hdds they claim  of reduction in power usage per terabyte of storage in february  western digital announced a new purple line of hard disk drives for use in video surveillance systems with capacities from  to  tb they feature internal optimizations for applications that involve nearconstant disk writing and allframe technology which is designed to reduce write errors this line was later expanded to include  and  tb models in september  western digitals hgst division introduced new heliumfilled  tb  tb and  tb hdds out of which the  tb variant also utilizes shingled magnetic recording smr in december  western digital acquired skyera a

smartware with many of its drives for use as backup drives with an exception for its touro mobile hard drives which is a hdd brand from its hgst division additionally this software does not detect any hgstproduced hard drives in contrast with the automatic detection of western digitals my passport or my passport ultra hard drives once the user plugs it in a computer where wd smartware is installed this software backs up all documents pictures movies emails and more on the drive and continually checks for changes to drive locations this means that regular backup takes place the software appears to detect particular hard drives brand and differs western digital hard drives from another hard drives a similar way to seagates seatools software however as of june  one can no longer use a boot disc to test a modern wd drive independently of an operating system in the explanatory note on its support site western digital omits to elaborate on why it forces users to use windows to test its

digital maintained that they used the indisputably correct industry standard for measuring and describing storage capacity and that they cannot be expected to reform the software industry they agreed to settle in march  with a  refund to affected customers in the form of backup and recovery software of the same value a disclaimer is now included with all drives explaining the capacity figures

commonly referred to as western digital and often abbreviated as wdc or wd is an american computer data storage company and one of the largest computer hard disk drive manufacturers in the world along with seagate technology western digital corporation has a long history in the electronics industry as an integrated circuit maker and a storage products company western digital was founded on april   by alvin b phillips a motorola employee as general digital initially and briefly a manufacturer of mos test equipment it rapidly became a speciality semiconductor maker with startup capital provided by several individual investors and industrial giant emerson electric around july  it adopted its current name and soon introduced its first product the wda uart contents  history  s  s  s  s  s  locations  products  hard drives  software  parallel ata hard disk drives  consumer products  lawsuits  issues  see also  references  external links historyedit sedit initially financed with startup capital provided by investors and emerson electric company wdc made its money by selling calculator chips through the early years of the s and by  wdc was the largest independent calculator chip maker in the world the oil crisis of the mids and the bankruptcy of its biggest calculator customer bowmar instrument changed its fortunes however and in  western digital declared chapter  bankruptcy after this emerson withdrew their support of the company and wdc was on its own wdc introduced several landmark products during this time including the mcp multichip microcoded cpu the mcp was used to implement decs lsi system and their own pascal microengine microcomputer which ran the ucsd psystem version iii and ucsd pascal the processor was also used in several singlechip floppy disk drive controller chips notably the fd however the wd integrated circuit that arguably drove westerns forward integration was the  chip the first disk drive formattercontroller replacing boards of ttl logic despite a price far higher than average cmos chips of the time it was very successful and extremely profitable sedit the fd and its kin were wdcs first entry into the data storage industry by the early s they were making hard disk drive controllers and in  they won the contract to provide ibm with controllers for the pcat that controller the wd became the basis of the ata interface which wdc developed along with compaq and control data corporations mpi division now owned by seagate technology starting in  throughout most of the s the family of controllers based on the wd provided the bulk of wdcs revenues and profits and for a time generated enormous corporate growth western digital paradise vga card bit isa bus circa  much of the midtolate s saw an effort by wdc to use the profits from their ata storage controllers to become a generalpurpose oem hardware supplier for the pc industry as a result wdc purchased a number of hardware companies these included graphics cards through its paradise subsidiary purchased  which became western digital imaging core logic chipsets by purchasing faraday electronics inc in  scsi controller chips for disk and tape devices by purchasing adsi in  networking wd wd ethernet and wds starlan they did well especially paradise which produced one of the best vga cards of the era but storagerelated chips and disk controllers were their biggest money makers in  they introduced the wdc singlechip scsi interface which was used in the first bit bus mastering scsi host adapter the wd fasst in  they introduced the wdc a singlechip implementation of the pcats floppy disk controller circuitry and the grandfather of modern super io chips in  they introduced the wdc vanilla the first singlechip ata hard disk controller  also brought what would be the biggest change in wdcs history that year wdc bought the hard drive production assets of pc hardware maker tandon the first products of that union under wdcs own name were the centaur series of ata and xt attachment drivescitation needed sedit western digital tidbit  wdah   mb  inch drive mounted in  inch adapter bracket western digital caviar  mb model number wdac from a series of hdds for desktop pcs it is a inch hdd mounted onto a inch adapter bracket by  things were starting to slow down as the pc industry moved from st and esdi drives to ata and scsi and thus were buying fewer hard disk controller boards that year saw the rise of wdcs caviar drives brand new designs that used the latest in embedded servo and computerized diagnostic systems eventually the successful sales of the caviar drives resulted in wdc starting to sell some of its divisions paradise was sold to philips and since disappeared its networking and floppy drive controller divisions went to smc networks and its scsi chip business went to future domain which was later bought out by market leader adaptec around  the technological lead that the caviar drives had enjoyed was eclipsed by newer offerings from other companies especially quantum corp and wdc fell into a slump products and ideas of this time did not go far the portfolio drive a inch  mm form factor model developed with jt storage was a flop as was the sdx hard disk to cdrom interface wdcs drives started to slip further behind competing products and quality began to suffer system builders and pc enthusiasts who used to recommend wd above all else were going to the competition particularly maxtor whose products had improved significantly by the late s in an attempt to turn the tide in  wdc recruited the help of ibm this agreement gave wdc the rights to use certain ibm technologies including giant magnetoresistive gmr heads and access to ibm production facilities the result was the expert line of drives introduced in early  the idea worked and wdc regained respect in the press and among users even despite a recall in  which was due to bad motor driver chips wdc later broke ties to ibm sedit western digital wdgd  gb raptor a  rpm inch hdd in  western digital became the first manufacturer to offer mainstream ata hard disk drives with  mib of disk buffer at that time most desktop hard disk drives had  mb of buffer wdc labeled these  mb models as special edition and distinguished them with the jb code the  mb models had the bb code the first  mb cache drive was the  gb wdjb followed by other models starting with  gb capacity wdc advertised the jb models for costeffective file servers in october  wd restated its prior year results to reflect the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no and the reclassification of connex and sanavigator results as discontinued operations in  wd acquired most of the assets of bankrupt onetime market leading magnetic hard drive readwrite head developer readrite corporation in the same year wd offered the first  rpm serial ata hdd the wdgd raptor with a capacity of  gb and an average access time of less than six milliseconds soon the  gb wdgd followed which was also much quieter in  western digital redesigned its logo for the first time since  with the design of new logo focusing on the companys initials wd in  western digital released the  gb version the wd which was also available in a special version with a transparent window enabling the user to see the drives heads move over the platters while the drive read and wrote data as of update the wd raptor drives have a fiveyear warranty making them a more attractive choice for inexpensive storage servers where a large number of drives in constant use increases the likelihood of a drive failure in  western digital introduced its my book line of mass market external hard drives that feature a compact booklike design on october   western digital released several editions of a single  tb hard drive the largest in its my book line in  western digital acquired magnetic media maker komag also in the same year western digital adopted perpendicular recording technology in its line of notebook and desktop drives this allowed it to produce notebook and desktop drives in the largest classes of the time western digital also started to produce the energy efficient gp green power range of drives notable for their very low power consumption and heat dissipation but surprisingly good performance in  western digital announced the wd gp drive touting rotational speed between  and  rpm which if potentially misleading is technically correct the drive spins at  rpm and the green power spin speed is not variable wd gp drives are programmed to unload the heads whenever idle for a very short period of time many linux installations write to the file system a few times a minute in the background as a result there may be  or more load cycles per hour and the  load cycles rating of a wd gp drive may be exceeded in less than a year two thirdgeneration  tb velociraptors in icepack mounting frames on april   western digital announced the next generation of its  rpm sata wd raptor series of hard drives the new drives called wd velociraptor featured  gb capacity and inch  mm platters enclosed in the icepack a inch  mm mounting frame with a builtin heat sink western digital said that the new drives are  percent faster than the previous generation on september   western digital shipped a  gb inch  mm notebook hard drive which is part of their scorpio blue series of notebook hard drives on january   western digital shipped the first  tb internal hard disk drive on march   wdc entered the solidstate drive market with the acquisition of siliconsystems inc on july   western digital announced the first  tb mobile hard disk drive which shipped as both a passport series portable usb drive as well as a scorpio blue series notebook drive sedit in april  western digital acquired the magnetic glass media sputtering operations of hoya corporation and hoya magnetics singapore pte ltd homs while western digital had previously acquired other magnetic glass media sputtering operations the purchase of homs gave western digital an edge in its striving to produce highend hard disk drives using magnetic glass media by  there were three surviving independent hdd glass media manufacturing plants namely showa denko fuji electric and hoya magneticscitation needed in october  western digital announced the first  tb internal hard disk drive in march  western digital agreed to acquire the storage unit of hitachi hitachi global storage technologies for about  billion of which  billion was paid in cash and the rest with  million shares of western digital on october   western digitals thailand plant suspended operation in relation to the  thailand floods this caused a shortage of hard drives supplied by western digital pc manufacturers noted of the issue with apple ceo tim cook stating that he was expecting an overall industry shortage of disk drives a dell spokesperson also stated they were working with our hard drive suppliers to address potential impact for the remainder of the year despite this western digitals profits increased following the increase of hdd prices western digital red  tb a nasoptimized inch sata hdd in march  western digital completed the acquisition of hitachi

november  western digital announced a  tb internal hard disk drive a inch  rpm drive belonging to the black series on january   timothy martin leyden announced wd would invest us  million to expand in thailand operations resumed in thailand after it recovered from damage during the  floods in november  western digital through its hgst subsidiary showed off new heliumfilled  tb ultrastar he hard disk drives when compared to regular airfilled hdds they claim  of reduction in power usage per terabyte of storage in february  western digital announced a new purple line of hard disk drives for use in video surveillance systems with capacities from  to  tb they feature internal optimizations for applications that involve nearconstant disk writing and allframe technology which is designed to reduce write errors this line was later expanded to include  and  tb models in september  western digitals hgst division introduced new heliumfilled  tb  tb and  tb hdds out of which the  tb variant

which is a hdd brand from its hgst division additionally this software does not detect any hgstproduced hard drives in contrast with the automatic detection of western digitals my passport or my passport ultra hard drives once the user plugs it in a computer where wd smartware is installed this software backs up all documents pictures movies emails and more on the drive and continually checks for changes to drive locations this means that regular backup takes place the software appears to detect particular hard drives brand and differs western digital hard drives from another hard drives a similar way to seagates seatools software however as of june  one can no longer use a boot disc to test a modern wd drive independently of an operating system in the explanatory note on its support site western digital omits to elaborate on why it forces users to use windows to test its drives alluding to an os x issue due to limitations in mac os x you will need to connect your drive to a pc

manufacturers including western digital related to the claimed capacity of their drives the drives are labelled using the convention of   bytes to the kilobyte resulting in a perceived capacity shortfall when reported by most operating systems which tend to use   bytes to the kilobyte while western digital maintained that they used the indisputably correct industry standard for measuring and describing storage capacity and that they cannot be expected to reform the software industry they agreed to settle in march  with a  refund to affected customers in the form of backup and recovery

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
