traded as nasdaq tndm founded san diego california   headquarters san diego california united states number of employees  website wwwtandemdiabetescom tandem diabetes care is a public us medical device manufacturer based in san diego ca the company develops medical technologies for the treatment of diabetes and specifically insulin infusion therapy historyedit in  a group of engineers recognized the need for new and improved methods of pumping insulin and incorporated as phluid inc in  kim blickenstaff joined the organization as president and ceo bringing his philosophy of using market research as the inspiration for product development and started on the development of the tslim insulin pump in  this predecessor company became the newly incorporated tandem diabetes care inc that was formed with a focus on promoting a comprehensive usercentric and integrated approach to diabetes product development and customer care tandem diabetes care felt that incorporating enhanced ease of use and attractive design—often associated with consumer electronics development—would also encourage more patients to consider the clinical benefits of insulin pump therapy tandem diabetes care interviewed more than  insulin pump users and health care providers to design its first device the tslim insulin pump productsedit in november  the company received fda clearance to market the tslim insulin pump the first ever touchscreen insulin pump in february  the company received fda clearance to market the tconnect diabetes management application a mac and pccompatible data management application that provides tslim pump users and their healthcare providers a way to display data from the pump and supported blood glucose meters on a cloudbased platform in january  tandem announced fda clearance of the tflex insulin pump the largest capacity insulin pump on the market in july  tandem announced that it had submitted a pma for the tslim g which integrates tslim pump technology with the dexcom g platinum cgm system this device was approved by the fda in september  the fda approved a tool to update the software on tandems pumps in july  the tandem product updater is designed to deliver software updates to tandems pumps to provide new features and interface improvements in announcing the approval tandem stated that the first use of the new tool will be to update tslim pumps which were shipped prior to april  with a new version of the firmware which speeds the loading process and offers other enhancements in late october  tandem began shipping its nextgeneration pump platform the tslim x the x will receive updates via the tandem product updater product with planned updates initially including integration with dexcoms g and g continuous glucose monitors and eventually the integration of closedloop technology which tandem licensed from typezero in july  referencesedit  httpinvestingbusinessweekcomresearchstocksprivatesnapshotaspprivcapid

or answering questions about the offering kim blickenstaff tandems president and ceo will be leading todays call and at this time ill turn it over to kim kim blickenstaff thank you susan hello everyone and thank you for joining us on todays second quarter earnings call with me today is john cajigas our chief financial officer looking back at the first half of  i was very happy to see the demand for our nextgeneration tslim x pump remained high and im proud of our employees for the overall strength that we continue to demonstrate both commercially and operationally we made considerable progress on our gross margin and decreased our quarterly use of cash by more than  sequentially while continuing to provide industryleading customer support these accomplishments give us confidence in our ability to achieve our key goals which focus on continuing to provide our customers with number one rated support bringing new innovations to the diabetes community and driving the company toward profitability the tslim x pump is solidifying its position as our nextgeneration flagship products it brings people with diabetes all of the features and benefits and highlights tandems focus on listening to customer feedback and is the only insulin pump that can be updated by a customer to add new features using their personal computer the tslim x represented the vast majority of our pump shipments this quarter and once again nearly  of our customers reported being new to pump therapy for multiple daily injections notably among customers switching from the competitors pump we continue to see that largest percentage converting from medtronic followed by animas the continued high demand for the tslim x by people who previously used mdi is confirmation that we are making progress on our longtime strategic goal to bring the benefits of insulin pump therapy to more people with diabetes we believe that following the fdas approval of the tslim x with g integration we will have an additional benefit to offer the diabetes community and further this mission our first insulin pump with dexcom g sensor integration is currently under fda review and while approval is at the discretion of the fda we are prepared to launch as soon as thats received we have approximately  people currently using the tslim x pump and there is great excitement among our employees that work on the tandem device updater for the opportunity to demonstrate the true advantage of updatability we expect that providing our tslim x customers with g integration for no cost will reinforce the power of our modern consumer technology that no other insulin pump offers it will also be the fulfillment of our vision that we outlined years ago to offer our customers a universal pump platform that can be updated as new innovations are approved by the fda we also expect that our launch of the tslim x with g integration will give customers the opportunity to weigh their purchasing decision head to head with the latest technology from our competitors a very significant advantage of the tslim x with g integration will be the access that our customers will gain to dexcom share feature which allows a patient to share their cgm data to their apple or android phone with up to five loved ones anecdotally we continue to hear mixed reviews of medtronics new platform including feedback from customers and healthcare providers who are disappointed by the g the concerns we hear most often center around the gs new interface being difficult to learn train and use the pumps substantially larger formfactor frustration with automode exists and variability in sensor accuracy particularly when compared to the published accuracy of dexcoms g system which continues to be the only cgm system approved to allow users to make bolused dosing decisions from cgm values without confirmatory finger stick in looking at other notable points of comparison the tslim xs formfactor and ease of use shines in comparison to the g that is more than  larger than the tslim x and has physical button operations our display is onethird larger than the g screen and it continues to be the only pump to feature a touch screen the tslim x was approved for people aged six and above while the g is not indicated for use by anyone below the age of  the tslim x features bluetooth connectivity and a rechargeable battery that in todays world consumers have come to expect and finally as we discussed the tslim x is the only updateable pump available so patients wont have to participate in complicated swapout programs to access new technology going into the third quarter we believe the tslim x offers meaningful advantages as compared to medtronics pumps and our tslim x with g will further strengthen our position in the market we believe customers who had been on the sidelines waiting to learn more about the g are beginning to make purchasing decisions once again and this trend will benefit us in the reminder of the year as a reminder insulin pump sales follows seasonal pattern which results in the fourth quarter being the strong quarter of the year we believe there is great excitement in the diabetes community for the tslim x with g integration to receive fda approval after were able to demonstrate the device updaters ability to deliver a substantial feature benefit to our existing customers in a quick and easy way we believe there will be even more interest and future potential im pleased to share that we are continuing to make great progress on our two automated insulin delivery products both of which are designed to be offering the software updates to our x customers after theyre approved by the fda automated insulin delivery systems are only as good as the continuous glucose monitoring sensor that drives them its well documented that dexcoms g sensor is the most accurate in the market and the g will even have improved accuracy adoption of automated insulin delivery systems by patients and healthcare providers will be a function of the burden imposed for the training and use of the system the g sensor has the least calibration to achieve the best accuracy only to a day the g also requires no bolus fingerstick confirmations all of this reduces patient burden tslim with its intuitive touch screen interface is documented to be easy to use and train this also reduces burden for patients and their providers we believe the combination of tandems tslim x dexcom sensors and algorithms will provide automated delivery systems that will be reliable easy to use and provide improved patient care blood glucose levels can be affected by many factors such as the type or quantity of food eaten illness stress and exercise the goal of automated insulin delivery is to enable patients to avoid hypoglycemia or low blood glucose levels hyperglycemia or high blood glucose levels and improved time in the normal glycemic range of  mgs per deciliter to  mgs per deciliter hypoglycemia can cause a variety of longterm complication such as damage to various tissues and organs seizures coma or tragically even death hypoglycemia is especially prevalent in night when people are increased risk of their blood sugar is going lower during sleep hypoglycemia is not only associated with considerable costs of individual in terms of wellbeing it also represents a substantial costs burden to the healthcare systems hyperglycemia can also cause a variety of longterm effects including cardiovascular disease and damage to various tissues and organs our first generation automated insulin delivery system is tslim x with predictive low glucose suspend or plgs this system is designed to prevent hypoglycemia by suspending basal insulin delivery when low blood sugar is predicted based on the dexcom g sensor values last month if the american diabetes association scientific sessions dr gregory forlenza of the barbara davis center for diabetes presented results from our plgs feasibility study results were very encouraging just those expected no hypoglycemic events were observed during this overnight study we use the data from the study and the ide submission for our pivotal study which was approved by the fda in may its designed as a six week crossover study and our five trial sites are preparing to begin enrollment of the  participants based on the study timing we believe we will conclude before the end of the year and then well submit a pma to the fda for this product once reports from the sites are finalized our market research has shown the hypoglycemic prevention is about  of the value the customers seek an automated insulin delivery algorithm which are tslim x with plgs is designed to provide we continue to anticipate that the review timeline for tslim x with plgs will benefit from the fdas current review of the tslim x with g as the only different feature will be the plgs algorithm based on where we are in the process and assumed fda timelines a launch in summer  is likely a realistic goal our second generation automated insulin delivery system is intended to reduce hypo and hyperglycemic events and improve the time of percentage in the normal blood sugar range this system include tslim x pump with treattorange technology that we licensed from typezero as well as dexcom g sensor with typezeros technology our product for both increase and decrease basal insulin based on a persons blood glucose levels as well as deliver automated correction boluses as a reminder we are participating in the nih funded international diabetes closed loop trial alongside typezero and dexcom we plan to use the data from a portion of this trial as our pivotal trial data in a pma filing with the fda based upon the traditional review times we are targeting the launch of the typezero algorithm on our tslim x platform by the end of  we believe the combination of our easytouse pump and superior cgm technology will result in a less burdensome system along more people to successful therapy using automated insulin delivery as you can see we are making great progress with our products under development and our working to maintain our solid track record of delivering new innovative products and features to the diabetes community historically tandem products have only been available in the united states the international pump market is an opportunity that weve continued to evaluate as demand from potential customers and healthcare providers outside of the united states has been building behind the scene we have been working to ensure our product testing and documentation of our quality systems meet international requirements and we are pleased to report that we recently completed a successful audit from our notified body confirming as much to that end i am excited to share the tandem is preparing to file for ce mark by the end of this year and that we are planning to initiate sales of our tslim x insulin pump and a handful of key geographies outside of the united states including canada next year our management team has experience in this process and we plan to partner with distributors who will service and support our customers outside the united states overall our expansion into international markets will be a meaningful milestone for tandem its been a longer term goal to bring the features and benefits of our pumps the people with diabetes worldwide we will be providing more detail on our international strategy as the year progresses but as you look at key growth drivers for our business over the next  months it will be a component alongside the launch of our new products domestically or scaling of infusion set sales and increasing opportunities from pump renewals id also like to reemphasize that we understand that our customers have choices and that customers who choose tandem product rely on us for the longterm care its a responsibility that we do not take lightly we take great pride in our high customer satisfaction scores and we intend to continue to deliver on our new products and development and validate the great process that our customers have placed with us we understand the financial resources this effort requires consistent with what we discussed last quarter we continue to evaluate multiple financing options that plan to provide additional clarity by the end of third quarter our priorities have not changed and we remain confident that our differentiated insulin pumps the power of our tandem device updater and our robust pipeline position as well to compete both in the near and long term doing so helps us achieve our broader goals of successfully executing our business plan supporting our customers and building shareholder value ill now turn the call over to john who will provide further detail on our results for the quarter and our financial guidance john cajigas thanks kim good afternoon everyone today ill be reviewing our q results on both the gaap and nongaap basis and provide a color on our commercial and operational accomplishments as a reminder are nongaap results are adjusted from our gaap results by excluding the impact of our technology upgrade program which was initiated in july  we believe that looking at our operating results on the nongaap basis provides useful information when comparing to our financial results for periods prior to q  in  the nongaap adjustments primarily included the recognition of sales and cost of sales previously deferred as a result of technology upgrade program accounting for upgrades that were fulfilled this year we also recognized incremental upgrade fees and product cost incurred to fulfill the upgrade obligations the program is scheduled to expire in september  a reconciliation of gaap results to nongaap results is included in todays earnings press release as an exhibit now looking at our sales and product shipments for q of  our gaap sales were  million compared to  million for q  our nongaap sales were also  million compared to  million in q the strong sequential growth was driven primarily by an increase in pump shipments as well as infusion sets sales although it remains competitive market as kim mentioned we continue to see signs of the pump market is beginning to unfreeze and we anticipate this trend will continue throughout remainder of the year during q our pump gaap sales were  million compared to  million in q our nongaap pump sales were  million compared to  million in q we shipped a total  pumps a  increase from  pumps we shipped in q our tslim x represented  of pump shipped during the quarter it was a dominant pump offering as we believe customers appreciate the tslim xs key differentiated features and its capabilities and combination with the tandem device updater these technologies have potential to offer significant advancements during our customers four year warranty period without clumsy hardware exchanges as of the end of q our cumulative shipments have grown to approximately  pumps this accomplishment provides us a sizable customer base from which we generate ongoing pump supply sales especially as we increasingly capture infusion sets sales from our distributors that being said it is important to remember that our pumps make up the greatest percentage of our overall sales followed by infusion sets and then cartridges we often discuss pump supplies in total which includes both infusion sets and cartridges however there is a dramatic difference in the financial contributions of these two products the customer typically changes their cartridge and infusion sets at the same time so the use approximately the same number on an annual basis however for a single customer using both our infusion sets and cartridges in the same change frequency the infusion set typically would generate about  to  of the pump supply sales and the cartridge would provide the remainder in the past we typically lost the infusion set sales whenever a customer would service through a distributor because the infusion sets were not proprietary and were available from multiple suppliers distributor sales have historically represented more than  of our business therefore for every cartridge sold we typically only sold an infusion set a fraction of the time capturing the significant infusion set revenue stream is an important opportunity in our drive towards profitability as a reminder when we do not have a direct billing contract with a customers insurance payer we partner with the distributor who provides our customers access to our products on the new network basis last year we began executing a twopart strategy that focused on capturing more of the potential infusion set revenue part one was the design and development of our custom tlock connector which provides benefits to our customers by reducing the cartridge fill time and lowering the amount of wasted insulin both of which were top request in our  and  customer surveys the manufacturer who makes our infusion sets is making all of our tlock compatible sets and we will offer the same selection of infusion sets as we do today we remain on track to launch tlock in the third quarter and expect our ratio of quarterly shipments of infusion sets to cartridges will be nearly  by the end of the year in advance of that we are already beginning to see a meaningful increase infusion set sales as a result of the second part of our strategy the renegotiation of our distributor contracts in anticipation of the launch of tlock connector in fact beginning in the fourth quarter of  infusion sets overtook cartridges in sales for the first time we are very pleased to see that the ratio of the number of infusion sets shipped to the number cartridges shipped increased to  in q compared to  in q and  in q  accordingly sales of our infusion sets in q increased to  million compared to  million in q and  million in q  from a volume perspective our shipments also have more than doubled compared to last year sales of our cartridges in q were  million compared to  million in q and  million in q  overall our pump supply sales for the last six months are already at twothirds of our pump supply sales for all of  notably this significant progress is in advance for our upcoming custom tlock connector launch clearly the infusion sets are becoming a larger percentage of our total sales providing meaningful source of gross profits the magnitude that each of our product influences our gross profits and overall gross margin is heavily impacted by the relative percentage of total sales that each of our products represent so pumps have the greatest impact on our gross profits and overall gross margins by far followed by infusion sets and to a much lesser extent cartridges also as we experienced changes in our overall mix of our products sales our overall gross margin has been impacted in q pumps represented  of our gaap based sales infusion sets represented  and cartridges represented  by comparison in q  pumps represented  of sales infusion sets represented  and cartridges represented  moving forward we still expect pumps will continue to beat the majority of our sales mix and a significantly higher percentage of our sales compared to infusion sets or cartridges significant shifts in our sales mix combined with the gross margin difference between our pumps and pump supplies have and will continue to impact our overall gross margin in q our gross profit on a gaap basis was more than  higher than q and was  higher on a nongaap basis more specifically our gaap based gross profit during q was  million compared to  million in q and our nongaap gross profit for q was  million compared to  million in q our gaap and nongaap overall gross margin for q increased  compared to  on a gaap basis and  on a nongaap basis for q the increases in our overall gross profits and overall gross margin were largely driven by a  sequential increase in pump shipments and increasing infusion set sales but equally important we also made meaningful improvements to the manufacturing cost of our products more specifically on pump improvements is a reduction in our material cost with the recent launch of our tslim x as well as increased manufacturing efficiencies and continued improvement in our warranty results as we are keenly focused on our pathway to profitability ive been happy to see that our pump supplies gross margins have been positive now for three consecutive quarters capturing infusion sets sales and the gross profit contributions they provide is a great opportunity for our business i anticipate this trend will continue particularly as we continue to increase our ratio of infusion sets to cartridges from  in q to  by year end weve also continued to make meaningful gross margin improvements on our cartridges this progress primarily relates to larger production volumes associate with our growing installed base as well as an improved yield in the manufacturing efficiencies that being said because cartridges are now such a small percentage of our sales progress we make in this area helps but does not benefit our business nearly as much as even a small improvement for our pump gross margin or capturing sales of infusion sets as you can see weve made great progress within our manufacturing operations during the last year we still have a significant opportunity in this area and the highly anticipated launch of the tslim x with g the launch of tlock at higher pump renewal opportunities in the second half of the year will be key drivers for higher pump sales in overall gross margin looking at the rest of our pl our gaap operating loss for q was  million compared to  million in q resulting operating margin was negative  in q compared to negative  in q our nongaap operating loss and operating margin were consistent with our gaap results during the quarter however i want to call out that our q operating loss included noncash expense of  million for stock based compensation and  million for depreciation and amortization for q our stock based compensation was  million and our depreciation and amortization was  million there was a meaningful increase in the stock based compensation in q which was associated with  million acceleration of unamortized stock based compensation related to our employee stock purchase plan what prompts the acceleration was that we decided to suspend our espp in q as we exhausted the shares available under the plan this was primarily a result of high employee to participate in recent purchased periods and our lower stock price to be clear no one is deriving a benefit from this noncash charge but nevertheless we reduced our operating margin by approximately  points in q even with this onetime stock based compensation charge in q our operating expenses decreased  compared to q and only increase from q  by  million or  as we continue to closely manage our spending with respect to cash at the end of q our total cash and investment balance sheet was approximately  million our cash and investments decreased by  million in q compared to  million in q  excluding the net proceeds of the equity offering that we completed in q this reduction is in line with our expectations of a sequentially quarterly decline in cash burn over the course of the calendar year due to seasonality of the business our gaap sales increased sequentially  and our gaap gross profit increased  compared to  and  on a nongaap basis respectively additionally working capital changes during q impacted our use of cash our capital expenditures during the quarter which were  million declined  million sequentially as we completed tenant improvements in our new manufacturing facility in q  this was offset by  million increase in our inventory levels in anticipation of moving our manufacturing operations as well as the anticipated launch of the tslim x with g and tlock the manufacturing weve commenced during the second quarter and we successfully completed the first of several regulatory inspections and expect to transition our operations in a stepwise fashion over the remainder to  pending completion of remaining inspections with respect to guidance we are reaffirming our previous total sales and operating margin guidance for  we continue to expect our full year  nongaap sales guidance to be in the range of  million to  million for all products which excludes the financial and accounting impact of the technology upgrade program sales are anticipated to be heavily backend loaded particularly towards q due to our typical seasonality the launch timing of the tslim x with g and tlock and our  renewal opportunity as a reminder  is our first full year with customers eligible for renewal under the typical four year insurance reimbursement cycle although we wont likely quantify any specific trends until after q of the people who are currently eligible we are pleased with the renewal interest we also expect that the approval of the tslim x with g will provide us with a competitive boost and will drive growth in the second half of the year we believe that offering the features benefits of the tslim x with the most accurate cgm sensor available and commercially demonstrating the capabilities of the tandem device updater will be important catalysts to our future growth and drive us towards profitability we also continue to expect our nongaap operating margin to be in the range of negative  to negative  for the full year  this guidance includes noncash operating expenses of approximately  million in stockbased compensation and approximately  million to  million of depreciation and amortization we expect our quarterly cash use will continue to sequentially decrease throughout the remainder of the year with the greatest decline in the fourth quarter and that the overall cash use for  will be lower than the  million we used in  we are highly focused on items that improve competitiveness in the marketplace and improve our gross profits and gross margins additionally we continue to control and even reduce some of our operating expenses and capital expenditures in a fiveyear period weve achieved a market share of approximately  in the past weve said that we believe that we can achieve sustained profitability when achieve a market share of  percent and gross margin of  we continue to believe this is possible in  and are evaluating opportunities to accelerate that time overall weve been evaluating multiple options to enhance our business and strengthen our balance sheet and as kim mentioned from a timing perspective are working to provide additional clarity by the end of the third quarter and expect to raise additional capital prior to the end of the year the performance of the business in the coming months expectations on probability timing and levels will be key factors in our evaluation of the financing earlier this month we filed a preliminary proxy with the sec that includes a reverse split proposal to our shareholders today we filed the associated definitive proxy our goal remains to build the value of our stock independent of this transaction however we want to be prepared for all options along those lines we also filed a  million atm this afternoon which is an atthemarket offering as a supplement to our financing plans is a vehicle that provides with the flexibility to sell shares at market prices and raise cash before we wrap up i want to recognize the successful efforts of all our employees during the first half of  in particular our sales force has remained competitive in the face of strong external headwinds internally weve been preparing for the launch of tslim x with g and tlock we made significant operational improvements that reduces manufacturing cost and improve product reliability our product development activities have continued to make great progress as to have our core business projects that allow us to improve the leverage of our infrastructure and maintain a high level of customer satisfaction for our products and services as a result we believe these catalysts will make for a very promising second half of the year we very much appreciate everyones hard work thank you everyone and with that ill turn it over to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from tao levy of wedbush your line is open tao levy great thank you good afternoon a couple questions at my end so first maybe you could talk about any potential programs that you may have needed to sort of push out or delay as you seek to reduce your operating expenses over the near term kim blickenstaff well id say we are not trying to reduce our operating expenses more control them and obviously we do rank our programs in terms of market importance and allocate our research and the manufacture and transfer dollars to those programs so now we have pushed out guidance on g integration plgs or the typezero those remain our highest priorities well talk more i think in future calls about some of the other improvements that are coming after those major programs for us as resources do free up tao levy okay great and then i dont know if youve ever talked about the sort of the percentage of your pump patients who are medicare age and i guess what im trying to figure out is will these patients be able to now transition to be able to use an integrated tandem device like you know i guess upgrade to the x or something where they can use a cgm if theyre going to get reimbursement on g kim blickenstaff so our medicare age patients are generally in the  to  range of our… susan morrison the people who are on medicare yeah kim blickenstaff medicare and medicaid so thats sort of the population youre dealing with susan morrison and as far as their ability to use the product so we wont know whether or not medicare would be covering any of the integrated systems until following fda approval and so unfortunately we dont have an answer for that at this time but its something that we will be pursuing tao levy got you okay and then just lastly in terms of the timing the plgs i think youre talking about now summer  is a realistic goal for a launch i think thats a little bit further behind than early  and is that just being conservative or is that based on your feedback from the fda thanks kim blickenstaff well its just a combination of the reality of the trial initiation recruitment and that timeline and then were assuming a standard review time for the fda so it probably would slipped most of all tao levy okay great thanks a lot susan morrison thanks tao operator thank you our next question is from matt obrien of piper jaffray your line is open jp mckim hi good afternoon this is jp on for matt thanks for taking the question i just want to touch back with the timeline there you are saying that it took a little longer to recruit than expected and the fda proving your ability of x to talk with g that should be in the near future but that doesnt really  thats not going to have affect the timeline of the low glucose suspend right kim blickenstaff no no thats right plgs is independent of the typezero program and theyre totally different to investigators that are involved in those also different size of clinical trial for both jp mckim okay so the midsummer launch of plgs is not going to be the one talking with dexcom sensor thats going to be at the end of  which is more of a closed loop kim blickenstaff the g will obviously talk with  the dexcom sensor receives that signal but we also use their transmission app to the droid and the apple platform so you have that share feature which others dont have in that marketplace and whats really unique about that is it if you think about a parent sending children off to school there is no way to get blood glucose values from them other than pick up the phone and call call the school nurse now they can actually track their childrens control during the day and we hear a lot about boyfriend girlfriend or spouses actually looking over the other persons shoulder to see how theyre doing especially at night because otherwise you have to wake people up and do a finger stick or wake people up and look at their pda so thats going to be a big advantage i think people are really going to enjoy with the g in advance of plgs being the automated hypo minimizer algorithm jp mckim got you and then yours will have  the one at  will actually have an auto bolus correction that youre probably the person on the market with that correct do you know where medtronic is in their process there kim blickenstaff yeah there is an announced process there i dont know that i have the dates but its farther out than our program jp mckim got it and then will you need to do anything once the g is out in terms of going back to the fda or will it just be kind of a software update on your end kim blickenstaff well g is already being worked on by dexcom to go the fda in the same timeframe that were predicting to be done with our trial and get approval so that well have get approved and our x will have been approved with plgs now were getting approval for the g plus the typezero algorithm so we havent forecasted any benefit from the fda having seen these pieces coming sequentially but thats sort of the order of events for the typezero product that is a g driven product jp mckim got you and then a couple of more one on tlock is right now you are at  basically capturing and you should get  by the end of q this year what  can we get some dollar amounts of what revenue capture that could be in terms of the  million  million john cajigas its going to be in the tens of millions the way we sort of look at it is a customer who buys our product on a direct basis somewhere between  and  on a total basis for consumables which includes cartridges and infusion set and infusion sets are about  to  of that jp mckim okay thats helpful and then the last one for me on your kind of the pump market you said  you commented that its unfreezing a little bit your feedback on synergies and mix have you seen sort of customer maybe trailing it or customers that were on hold come back to you guys thus far kim blickenstaff i would say they are early in the trial phase still our best estimates is about  people are on the g there is  in that queue in the priority access program so i really have to say everything is anecdotal there maybe a few cases of people coming back to us but its nothing we can measure trends on because the end number of people actually trailing that g is pretty small yeah jp mckim got it thanks for taking the question operator thank you next question is from ryan blicker of cowen and company your line is open ryan blicker hi thanks for taking my questions you discussed launching x internationally next year and said you plan to use distribution partners have distribution partners already been established or is that something you hope to achieve over the next couple of quarters john cajigas we are in the middle of that process now having discussions but we have not selected partnership ryan blicker okay and then maybe another on g display integration youve made very clear from the start that youll offer that update free of charge to customers however why not charge a nominal fee just to help the nearterm cash flow kim blickenstaff well i think our market standpoint we really want people to actively do that upgrade so they get the sense of the power of the device updater i mean we all are giving updates to our cell phones and giving them latest and greatest improvements and we used to do it via computer now were doing it via our providers but i really think this is something that we  of the x patients and we really want to push this out there quickly and help them understand the power of what theyre getting so the healthcare providers really begin to buy into the importance of upgradability during the four year life of a product because if you look at the next   years were going to have three upgrades here and so we just want to make sure we get the broadest experience as we launch this first update ryan blicker okay that makes sense and then i guess along those lines after youve established that as you look forward to future software updates is that something youd be consider kim blickenstaff that is something we will consider in the future i think this first round we really want establish the evidence that the way we go about upgrade its a simpler and easier process that doesnt involve clumsy hardware exchange programs ryan blicker got it and then one more quick one for me just on the trial timelines for the predictive low glucose suspend product can you provide any more details  more granular details and maybe when you expect to start that pivotal trial thank you susan morrison sure were preparing for a moment of the participants now its just based on the anticipated timing that thats going to be and then with the crossover nature of the study we dont expect the trial going to actually wrap up until just before yearend and just based on the nature of the time it takes for the centers to prepare the reports and then are filed the submission and then regulatory timeline thats where you add it up we also just  previously weve said we believe that theres going to be a benefit because the fda will just review tslim x with g integration and the only difference between the plgs product and that product theyre reviewing today is the algorithm but we really are still assuming that its going to be at least closer to six month timeline if you add all these timelines up and so were not really expecting any benefit from it but between now and yearend really the focus for the pivotal is recruitment of the participants and then completion of the trial itself ryan blicker got it thank you operator thank you our next question is from jeff johnson of baird your line is open unidentified analyst hi guys this is tim in for jeff this afternoon thanks for taking the questions first on new patient dynamics in the quarter when looking at the  of new patients that came from competitive conversions i know you called majority of those coming from medtronic and then jj but im just wondering if youve seen a shift in that mix if youre noticing less coming from medtronic and more from jj as jj has recently spell their channel support kim blickenstaff well i would say the trend weve seen is increasing mdi usage i mean obviously we were at  sort of total in our base and now were on the margin up in the  range but i dont think theres any other trends that weve seen in the converting of population that we have i mean obviously roche is essentially out of the market doesnt count for much and we traditionally have not converted insulin pump patients so over to a durable pump they like that patch pump lack of a catheter feature so mdi is very promising the rest of it is just sort of static unidentified analyst okay great thats very helpful and then in terms of your international rollout i know you call that canada specifically but would you be willing to provide any color on other geographies particularly in europe that you guys are going to be looking to get into first kim blickenstaff yes weve got some time to put that all together we were looking at them and there are some countries in europe that have better reimbursement environment so forth and obviously some of that reimburse pump so were putting that plan together but canada definitely is more like the us addition that we can execute fairly easily but we will give you more on which countries and when as we develop our plans toward the end of the year unidentified analyst okay great and then i guess one last one as you move to kind of a more of a recurring revenue stream with tlock and is that something that you might think about maybe down the road in terms of your palms just recently with the announcement from abbott and bigfoot and what it sounds like a kind of recurring monthly revenue model theyd be going to is that something that you guys would potentially be looking to explore down the road kim blickenstaff i think at this point we think our business model is the way to go especially with the current reimbursement dynamics that are out there unidentified analyst okay great thank you operator thank you at this time there are no other questions in the queue ill turn it to mr blickenstaff for closing remarks kim blickenstaff well thanks everybody for joining our all today we do have one healthcare conference between now and the next q conference call and thats the wedbush conference which is in new york city and were presenting on august  thats just several weeks away so anyway just in conclusion i think we have demonstrated strength in the first half of  we have great product potential for the back half of the year with our g launch and then beyond as we bring our plgs and our typezero treatment ph range products to the market through our tandem updater without these complex swap up programs so we look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to make progress on our financial front and on our product rollout front talk to you next quarter thank you operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for
