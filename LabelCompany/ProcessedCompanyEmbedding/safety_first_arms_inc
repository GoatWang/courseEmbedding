a safe home sfa t ×watch our videoclose×signup now sign up for exclusive updates on the smart  now in development if you are a human and are seeing this field please leave it blank fields marked with an  are required email  closetruly protect your family introducing the multisecure fast access smart ™ sign up for exclusive updatespin code access the smart ™ prevents unauthorized firing but unlocks in under a second with your pin code releasing the grip safety relocks the gun in onethird of a second and guards against takeaway secured system our patented theft guard™ system deters unauthorized handling tampering and theft with a loud motiontriggered alarm resists physical hacking and there’s no wireless access outside of a larger safe no other gun can protect like this practical reliable ready the smart ™ is the first practical userauthorized gun it has a long life battery and will be fully tested to rigorous standards and certified by third party labs the reliability of the locking system will be several times greater than that of the base firearm frequently asked questions why do i need the smart ™ to protect my home and family my gun needs to be instantly available but keeping a loaded unlocked accessible gun has safety and legal risks why not just use a gun safe or trigger lock a conventional trigger lock and key are not practical if the gun is needed in an instant the smart ™ allows faster access than a gun safe or trigger lock and can be moved to where you are for example from your bedside to your kitchen drawer the smart ™ also features a hour unlock mode to provide the readiness of a conventional gun when desired in addition a small gun safe can be stolen is the smart ™ a “smart gun” the patented smart ™ – mm pistol is nothing like those referred to in the media as “smart guns” the smart ™ uses a pin code lock which is very simple and more practical than technology such as fingerprint readers or “rfid” that require companion rings or watches additionally our exclusive theft guard and other features protect against unauthorized handling tampering and theft which puts the smart ™ in a whole new category how can i trust that it is reliable the smart ™ will be fully tested to rigorous standards and certified by third party labs it will meet or exceed the upcoming performance and reliability standards for personalized guns released by the national institute of justice the reliability of the locking system will be significantly greater than the reliability base firearm the smart ™ is built upon proven rugged technology such as the technology found on aircraft in automobiles and in the military methods and means to make our electronics and systems rugged are well known they are in widespread use in lifecritical and battlecritical situations should a gun rely on batteries that may fail at a critical time the smart ™ will feature a long life battery like those in critical electronics we depend on every day such as smoke detectors heart pacemakers a low battery indicator blinks when it’s time to change the batteries and if ignored an alarm will sound why a pin code a pin personal identification number code entry can be rehearsed memorized and completed in a second the durable lighted keypad can be used without problem in any environment pin codes entry is one of the most proven and commonly used methods of user verification today with thousands of code combinations possible combined with our theft guard alarm pin codes are quite secure a pin code is not as fast as an unlocked gun while the smart ™ may not work for individuals wanting to keep a loaded and unlocked gun nearby it’s a better alternative to a trigger guard or gun safe offering a multisecure and fast access solution it also has an optional hour unlock mode so it can function as a conventional gun when needed what is theft guard and how does it work a theft guard is a motion sensitive alarm system that sounds an earpiercing alarm if the smart ™ is moved or handled without the proper pin code entered within a countdown period for example after  seconds it protects against unauthorized handling tampering and theft it can be optionally turned off can the smart ™  be “hacked” or externally controlled the smart ™ is designed to be “unhackable” a gun that can be hacked controlled or disabled by someone else including the government or terrorists should not be sold since such a weakness could deny your right to keep and bear arms and to defend yourself the smart ’s only input is the keypad and it can only be unlocked with your pin code it does not have any wireless communication such as wifi rfidbluetooth or gps can the locking components be tampered with or disabled by a teen with a screwdriver or wrench the gun safety components are locked in the grip when the gun is locked deterring a potentially tragic result handling the smart ™ for longer than the allotted time will sound its theft guard alarm what’s wrong with fingerprint readers fingerprint readers have significant reliability issues in realworld use fingerprint based locks are not reliable especially when accessed with damp greasy moisturized gloved or wet hands or when the gun is dirty or dusty why not an rfid gun rfid radio frequency identification devices operate reliably but require a companion ring or watch that can be stolen with the gun and prove impractical for most people if left on a dresser an rfid device could tempt a curious child to experiment and may not protect the owner in a takeway situation wireless technologies in general are less secure do you support “smart gun” mandates no we are against these mandates they are unnecessary and hinder the free market mandates limit the constitutional rights of citizens to buy the gun of their choice specifically the smart gun mandate in new jersey has been shown to hinder the sale and distribution of safe gun technology mandates backfire and diminish the citizen’s right to bear arms while slowing safer gun developments over the past for  years the smart ™ will stand on its own merits and should neither be mandated nor prevented from being sold   interactive smart ™ tour

healthy every work morning during stretches and the morning production meeting safety topics are brought forward for open conversation amongst the crew it is an active way for our employees to communicate together to plan for the safest route of completing their daily tasks  each of our employees have been trained that safety starts with them they have a responsibility to conduct themselves in a safe working manner and we have a responsibility to give them the tools they need in order to achieve this when “near misses” or actual “accidents” happen we work in a swift manner to investigate the miss or accident and utilize information we compile to help better train our employees on specific issues we do this in the hopes that if an accident occurs we can at least provide practical positive training to reduce the risk of the same accident happening again and make our employees aware of potential hazards they may not have been aware of training training and more training our employees attend a “safety meeting” every monday and once a month all of our employees participate in a “safety training” all of our production and delivery staff perform morning inspections of their work space tools machinery forklifts and trucks faulty equipment can harm an otherwise safe employee  we place a high priority on lock outtag out procedures and reporting tools and devices that are
