injection at its coke field jul    et from glori energy inc houston july   prnewswire  glori energy inc nasdaq glri an energy technology and oil production company focused on enhanced oil recovery using its proprietary aero system announced today that it has commenced the nutrient injection phase of aero implementation at its coke field in wood county texas this is a significant mile marker for our company as we commence aero field deployment at our first major gloriowned and operated oil field said stuart page glori president and chief executive officer  based on performance data from aero client projects we expect to observe the initial responses at the coke field within two to four months gloris patented aero system which was developed in collaboration with statoil of norway works by injecting a proprietary mix of nutrients into water drive or waterflood sandstone reservoirs  the nutrients feed and stimulate microorganisms living in the reservoir and their increased activity improves the water sweep and the flow of oil through the reservoir to the wellbore aero technology has been commercially deployed by glori with various exploration and production clients in the us and canada and with petrobras in brazil the coke field is part of gloris ongoing strategy to acquire mature producing oil properties that have significant amounts of remaining oil and advantageous characteristics for the aero system to increase production and recover that residual oil typically only onethird of oil discovered in a reservoir is recoverable using conventional technologies gloris unique microbial enhanced oil recovery technology can potentially recover an additional  of the remaining oil at a cost of less than  per incremental barrel produced  we will initially implement aero at the coke field utilizing a recently drilled injection well ultimately we expect to utilize up to five injectors to maximize production and oil recovery page said  the next injection well is currently scheduled for the fourth quarter with the remaining injectors planned for  once fully implemented we believe aero will ultimately yield an additional  million barrels of oil over the life of the field through a combination of decreasing the existing decline curve and increasing production he said about glori energy inc glori energy is a houstonbased energy technology and oil production company that deploys its proprietary aero technology to increase the amount of oil that can be produced from conventional oil fields glori owns and operates oil fields onshore us and additionally provides its technology as a service to ep companies globally only onethird of all oil discovered in a typical reservoir is recoverable using conventional technologies the rest remains trapped in the rock gloris proprietary aero system recovers residual oil by stimulating a reservoirs native microorganisms to sustainably increase the ultimate recovery at a low cost  for more information visit
