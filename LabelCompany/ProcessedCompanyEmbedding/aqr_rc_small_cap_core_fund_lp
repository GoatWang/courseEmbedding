fact sheet investment objective seeks total return performance nav change daily return nav change daily return    as of    investment approach risk parity is all about diversification whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollarbased allocation risk parity portfolios focus on riskbased allocation aqrs risk parity fund invests globally across stocks bonds currencies and commodities allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky in building the portfolio we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term we target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments or “tilts” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive we believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner and adapting to market conditions the fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches aqr risk parity fund foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty the use of derivatives forward and futures contracts and commodities exposes the fund to additional risks including increased volatility lack of liquidity and possible losses greater than the fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs this fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed if the market price of a security increases after the fund borrows the security the fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential fund gains and increase potential fund losses when investing in bonds yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term there is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above

which incorporated the acquisitions of avaya and brocade into its financial projections the model increased investor confidence by highlighting future revenues north of  billion and projected that the company will be the thirdlargest enterprise networking vendor behind only cisco and hp enterprise shares of arcbest corp  portfolio weighting plummeted after the company released firstquarter earnings results below analyst estimates which were already low due to seasonal headwinds poor earnings results were a function of weakness in the companys asset light business due to cyclically weak demand for truckloads along with headwinds from the companys ecommerce platform for its asset heavy business our position in insperity inc  portfolio weighting underperformed during the period after the company reported mixed firstquarter results hurt by lowerthanexpected growth in net hiring and higher costs due to a spike in large health benefit claims which are typically episodic on a positive

driver of longterm performance over a full market cycle that said we currently hold the view that stocks perceived to be more volatile are undervalued relative to historical averages therefore we
