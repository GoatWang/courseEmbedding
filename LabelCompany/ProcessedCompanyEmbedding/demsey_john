president estée lauder companies september th  it’s a real treat to sit down with an icon known for successfully developing some of the best and biggest brands especially in the world of beauty where so many names seem to come and go our interview and photoshoot with the president of the estée lauder companies  john demsey was less a traditional tnp interview and more an education on all things branding demsey is known for establishing a brand’s authority and has brought beauty magnums like bobbi brown tom ford la mer smashbox and mac to the forefront of their industry constantly toeing the line between staying relevant and maintaining brand heritage for all the labels he oversees demsey is king when it comes to all things cosmetics while we were of course curious about beauty products we were also first and foremost eager to hear about beauty from the inside out the art of branding and – of course – ‘the new potato’ of cosmetics it’s no surprise that demsey had an answer for everything so listen up… what’s your ideal food day my ideal food day or my actual food day you can do both my ideal food day would be a totally fattening day i would start off the morning with a latte with a double shot of espresso and eggs benedict with toasted and buttered english muffins and jam then for lunch it would be a chopped chef salad iced tea and key lime pie for dinner it would be tomatoes with russian dressing a sirloin strip steak sliced medium rare hash brown potatoes and banana cream pie that’s my ideal and i’m starving as i’m discussing this with you my real meal morning fiberone skim milk lunch is stripped down salad with chicken for dinner mixed green salad chicken paillard and fresh fruit that’s the polar opposite of what i…what i lust for most just kind of jumping into estée lauder how are you constantly toeing the line with brands on celebrating a brand’s heritage while also keeping it relevant well i have a portfolio which is expanded now of over fourteen different brands which are very different in terms of their personalities you know  from bobbi brown estée lauder mac jo malone and tom ford to smashbox crème de la mer and designer fragrances each brand has a unique backstory a unique authentic dna and a voice what i try to do is be very deliberate when i’m working with a brand on living within the code or voice of that particular brand there’s something very special and unique in the way the estée lauder companies curate and nurture brands whether it is the original heritage brand estée lauder for  plus years a brand like mac or new brands that we bring into the portfolio i try to be respectful of the past i have a line in terms of when businesses get a little off track the answer is always in the room because brands become successful for a reason what you need to do is find the modern day context of what that reason means in today’s world not yesterday’s world if our brand was built on s aspiration what’s aspirational today what’s the aspiration of women today what’s luxury today what does skin care in the world of cosmetic procedures look like today the reality of context in which you discover products or brands is very different we were just talking before you came in about what you’re doing here an online virtual magazine content provider blogs and social media have totally changed the way that brands communicate and engage fans customers or people who want to know and that didn’t exist five years ago the old world paradigm of advertising merchandising product development and distribution has all changed my guess is if we are sitting down three or four years from now it’s going to be a hell of a lot different from today as well but the universal aspiration of beauty has been the same since time began everybody wants to look good everybody wants to be attractive everybody wants to feel good about themselves that’s a universal aspiration and no one is ever satisfied that actually brings me to my next question whether it’s online or print do you think there is a platform for beauty that’s most important for me personally versus for the business are two different things i’m an old world print guy i love magazines i’ve fallen in love with a lot of the content providers i love going on the sartorialist or the selby or other different sites because i really enjoy it i’ve sort of started getting addicted to shopping at st dibs i think it depends on how old you are if you’re over thirtyfive i still think the traditional media with a strong facebook sort of interface matters i think if you’re under twentyfive it’s all social media everything matters i have a sixyearold daughter so it’s interesting being in this business watching her start to develop and seeing how she interfaces with her ipad my guess is her generation will be very different than millennials now she’s multitasking all the time watching tv watching her ipad going through books doing things and she’s six so… so in terms of brands do you think one is more important than the other different brands have different communities it depends on the community and the engagement of that community for a particular brand for a brand like bobbi brown who is a persona and personality with her own social media channel we have a youtube channel called i love makeup which is brand sponsored but not brand messaged it’s a way of really engaging and understanding her philosophy on beauty for a brand like mac it’s about trend fashion now street and highlow a brand like estée lauder was built on a traditional distribution and advertising model and we just launched the estée edit it’s this amazing conceptual platform that goes back to the original voice of estée lauder herself and brings contemporary tastemakers in the context of what estée would have thought if she were here today it really matters it’s more holistic on a brand that’s been around for a long time and that has more traditional customers and media it’s a whole game for brands that didn’t start from that place when the designer of a brand moves horizontally – like bobbi brown going to yahoo beauty – what does that do for a brand well it’s interesting if you look at bobbi brown she started off as a contributor to the today show she began her business working out of frederic fekkai in bergdorf goodman as a freelance makeup artist with a tv gig she developed her brand off of a media persona with television as her platform yahoo is today’s platform i think there’s bobbi brown the person and there’s bobbi brown the brand they’re one in the same yet they’re very different i think you’re going to see more and more of that on our site we’re voyeuristic in the space of food beauty fashion etc but do you think that voyeurism is stronger in beauty than in other industries i think it’s voyeuristic because everybody wants to know the dirt on everybody else people like seeing other people without their makeup on and unfortunately society likes to build up and tear down whether it’s us weekly or star showing people in their bathing suits or good looks versus bad looks on fashion police it’s a guilty pleasure people like to look people also want to know a lot about the people they look up to or who are in the public eye beauty is something that’s very personal and something that’s very accessible you don’t need to have a lot of money to be able to accomplish a look and regardless of what your socioeconomic background is you can transform yourself with makeup and hair i think we’re all sort of voyeuristic i know i am do you think there’s highlow in beauty like in fashion absolutely you know there’s serious skin care serious beauty treatments and serious personal maintenance depending on if you’re that type of person then there’s total kooky wacky fun club goth or e entertainment sort of kardashian inspired beauty it all exists in the world at the same time and amazingly enough you see the influence all over the place so it’s very highlow and people shop highlow people shop at duane reade the supermarket bergdorf goodman saks fifth avenue sephora and macy’s people shop all over the place beauty in general tends to be promiscuous people like experimenting and trying a lot of things when it comes to makeup fragrances or styling products people like to play next page… pages   share

president john demsey and mac aids fund director nancy mahon talk viva glam nicki minaj and ricky martinby evan mulvihillfebruary    pmemailfacebooktwitternicki minaj and ricky martin faces of macs viva glam perform at the viva glam launch partyeach year mac cosmetics picks a bigname celebrity to feature on a trademark product for their viva glam campaign last year lady gaga partnered with the brand to produce viva glam gaga lipstick which had a sort of taupemeetscrimson sheen to it this year they’ve chosen nicki minaj for a bright bubblegumpink lipstick and ricky martin for a colorless unisex lip conditioner while many corporations wrangle endorsements from famous people at high prices and then hawk the products for higher profits mac gives  percent of all proceeds from their viva glam products to the mac aids fundafter a whirlwind media tour with appearances on good morning americaand live with kellyearlier in the day nicki and ricky relaxed at new york citys stage  last week for their muchhyped viva glam launch party before the bash we caught two of mac’s top execs and chatted them up about the famous duo nicki and ricky’s rhyming synergy how they make money off the products and whether obama is wearing makeup oncamerahere’s what john demsey group president of the estée lauder companiesand nancy mahon global executive director of the mac aids fund had to saynicki minaj with john demsey group president of the estée lauder companies how did you choose nicki and ricky as the new faces of the viva glam campaignjohn demsey both of them have huge diverse platforms in terms of their fan base and audience in nicki’s case she’s become one of the leading voices for young people and really has captured the imagination of the day we also believe she can sell the lipstick ricky has been a pop star since he was a young child he himself is on a trajectory to taking his career to greater heights it’s the first time that mac cosmetics has ever done a unisex product that can be used by men and women with no shades associated with it the two are a surprising fun combination of popculture personality muscle and fundraising abilitynancy mahon i’d just like to add that aids is the leading killer of black women in america and abroad that’s something nicki really took to heart and nicki’s uncle died of aids himselfyou guys give away  percent of the proceeds from nicki’s lipstick and ricky’s lip conditioner each costing  to the macaidsfund clearly it’s a great cause but how can you make any money off of it john we’ve been doing this for  years—first with rupaul and last year with lady gaga we’ve found that this cause in particular resonates with the staff that works for the brand as well as the customers around the world who are attracted to our brand whenever our viva glam business is at an alltime high so is our overall business for us this is not only good work—it’s good businessnancywe as a company give more money to aids than any other company in the world last year we raised  million and gave that all away we would be happy for more company so we not only encourage customers to make a difference but also other companies it’s a wonderful testament that you can do good in the world and do good businessin terms of selling the lip conditioner to men do you think they’ll really buy itjohn a littleknown fact is that there probably isn’t a performance artist model film star newscaster or journalist—male or female—in the world that doesn’t have some sort of experience with using a mac product from time to time it always amazes me how many men—politicians professional athletes—in the era of highdefinition television wear makeup as part of projecting their total imagedj benny benassi performs at the viva glam launch party are you going to name any names herejohnthere’s hardly a person i can think of that has not used our productsobamajohn i don’t know if he has i know that michelle hashow about brian wiliamsjohn everybody does we’ve come a long way since the nixonkennedy debates in i saw a promo ad that said one lipstick can buy  male condoms or  female condoms in terms of where the money will go do you focus on prevention research or medicine for those who already have the diseasenancy we certainly do fund condoms—we fund a large range of services—but the bulk of what we do is fund food and housing for people living with aids the bottom line is if you can’t eat and you don’t have a roof over your head you can’t practice prevention or get betterricky martin flashes a peace sign on his way into the party the nicki lipstick is bubblegumpink do you think girls will want to go for this really bold colorjohni’m sure of it because we had a little experiment when nicki came to us before she launched her first album pink friday she was big fan of a pink shade of our lipstick and we actually created a variant of the shade for her album launch which we put online only we thought we would sell  pieces over four fridays last november we sold  if you watched the grammys she wore the viva glam lipstick during her performancewhat did you think of that performance it was very catholicimagery inspired and somewhat blasphemous could that turn off some peoplejohnit could i think she definitely made a statement and got people’s attention and that’s what mac’s all aboutricky has around  or  million fans on twitter while nicki has  million is she the more famous spokesperson of the twojohn ricky has a very surprisingly big fan base in asia and in the international markets he really hasn’t been focusing on the american twitterusing market for quite some time i don’t know if you saw his performance on glee two weeks ago or the news that he’s going to be in evita on broadway but this campaign coincides with the reintroduction of ricky martin to mainstream americaricky’s not the first openly gay person you guys have used eitherjohn we’ve used rupaul kd lang and elton john so we’ve had everybody from all walks of life associated with the brandnancy john i didn’t get to tell you this but this morning nicki told me “boy you guys are really good at this i really like working with ricky” so they have very nice chemistryand it rhymesjohnwe didn’t know it was going to happen this way but it’s lining up to be a very rickyandnicki moment and mac is at the center

 forty floors above fifth avenue in a tastefully decorated if somewhat bland room dominated by a richard serra lithograph lies the corner office of john demsey group president of the estée lauder cos inc demsey oversees eight of the company’s key brands including estée lauder mac bobbi brown la mer jo malone tom ford prescriptives and the recently acquired smashbox in all industry sources estimate demsey’s brands generated an estimated  billion of the  billion in net sales that the company reported for its fiscal year  this story first appeared in the november   issue of wwd  subscribe today the th floor aerie is a visible manifestation of demsey’s professional achievements but the executive isn’t one to roost comfortably in an ivory tower rather demsey’s success stems from his prowess in knowing what’s happening outside the insular walls of his office more than any other beauty executive working today demsey is a master at keeping his fingers on the pulse of pop culture continually ahead of the curve in anticipating the next big thing — be it in the worlds of fashion music art celebrity retail photography publishing or design by applying that connectivity to the brands he oversees — most notably starting with mac back in  — demsey has helped redefine modernday beauty branding   “the brands that have longterm sustainability are the brands that live in the context of now — not based on who you used to be” says demsey who declined to comment on sales figures for this story   living in the context of now means that demsey is as comfortable at saks fifth avenue schmoozing with its chief executive offiver steve sadove during a frenzied fashion’s night out pit stop as he is two hours later welcoming hipster songstress beth ditto in a makeshift dressing room at mac’s soho store before she performs an electrifying set to adoring fans it means navigating his way through throngs of crossdressing fashionistas to greet nicola formichetti lady gaga’s stylist turned fashion designer who tonight is opening a popup store in tribeca and the next day escorting pop star nicki minaj to her frontrow seat at prabal gurung amid the glare of flashbulbs   “if anyone else looked at my schedule they would think why on earth is he doing those things” says demsey “yet what i know is that there is a rhyme and reason behind every single thing that i do”   that approach is one of his most defining characteristics “john’s greatest strength is his insight into the often not obvious aspects of the business such as popular culture and distribution” says leonard lauder chairman emeritus of the estée lauder cos inc who has known demsey since  “he shows a tremendous flexibility in comprehending how each brand needs a unique approach each brand that he supervises has created its own unique personality and individual growth rate no two brands look or soundalike that’s beyond brilliant”   jane hertzmark hudis the global brand president of estée lauder has seen firsthand how demsey filters the myriad influences he surrounds himself with parceling ideas to the brands they are most relevant for “what he’s amazing at is that he has his finger on the pulse he knows the beat and he can go to the edge and exciting part of any opportunity” she says “he has a sensibility about culture about edge about the next big trend and it is percolating with him he is sitting on it thinking about it and he looks among his brands for the right opportunity and puts it there he has a sensibility to pick up whatever is about to happen and seize that and see where the next opportunity can be” fabrizio freda the chief executive officer of lauder under whose tenure has seen demsey’s role at the company evolve from daytoday brand steward to group strategic thinker agrees “john is strategic and creative at the same time” says freda “he is very good about taking a chance when he sees the opportunity and enabling his team to have the courage to take a chance he knows when the right moment is to take risk he has a good hunter instinct” for proof take the rejuvenation of the estée lauder brand demsey was named its president in early  after successfully transforming mac from an indie makeup artist brand into a color cosmetics giant while lauder was undeniably a prestige sales powerhouse its image had become staid and in need of modernizing demsey was very familiar with the brand — his first job at the corporation was as its vice president of sales for the west coast and he diligently absorbed the teachings of estée lauder and leonard lauder however it was the time he spent away from it that held the key to demsey’s ideas for its reinvention “the greatest liberator to me was coming back after eight years at mac with fresh eyes” he says “the ability to have fresh eyes is not forever and i started thinking more abstractly in terms of what does estée lauder really mean who is our competition who is really buying the product “if a brand is successful there’s a reason and the answer is usually sitting in the room” he continues “and i try to go back to the original dna of what the brand was about” that thinking led demsey to estée herself who he saw in a new more modern light “i began to understand that she wasn’t conventional that her command of point of sale her point of view relative to product the way she conceptualized things and the way she worked with leonard were all quite different for the time” and that thinking led demsey to decide that it was time for a jolt enter tom ford the superstar designer who had recently inked a deal with lauder for an eponymous fragrance line and whose overtly sexual ethos was the polar opposite of lauder’s genteel universe demsey decided to do a cobranded limited edition color cosmetics collection to be called the tom ford and estée lauder collection “the idea was a shock to the brand and a shock to the world” he says “it was a shortterm association for the estée lauder brand but it was a turning point in that it reframed the importance of aspiration storytelling and establishing uniqueness and a point of difference to sell product” aspiration is a word that comes up often in demsey’s conversation in his mind it is the single most important attribute that the company sells “beauty in its abstract concept is an aspiration it’s not always a reality” he says “there is an aspirational element to beauty that exists from dollar stores all the way up to bergdorf goodman because beauty in its ultimate is an aspiration”   to that end aspiration is the lens through which demsey views all aspects of the business — be it product development or distribution strategies global expansion or brand messaging the success of tom ford’s collaboration with estée lauder helped clarify that vision even more “all of a sudden i had people calling me for the brand who had never called before” demsey recalls “that started to stimulate the thought in terms of how do you define modernday aspiration where does it exist and how do you live it” the answer was china period “thia breen and i came to the conclusion that the aspirational future of the world was asia and that was really the pull in terms of where if you wanted to win the hearts and minds of the aspirational consumer for the next    years you’d better be successful there to that end lauder shifted its message in china from “less promotional to more aspirational” demsey says with a clear emphasis on luxury skin care the concept demsey points out “was very similar to the way the brand was originally established in the us in the late s and ’s at stores like saks fifth avenue and i magnin” the strategy worked today estée lauder claims to be the numberone prestige beauty brand in its distribution and the fastestgrowing western brand in asia the estée lauder cos doesn’t break out regional sales by brand but sales in the asia pacific region increased  percent or  million for the fiscal year  to almost  billion sales in china alone grew  percent and the company expects it to become its largest market in asia pacific this year still it’s one thing to build a global business with a brand that already has more than  billion in sales it’s quite another to do it with a brand from scratch a feat demsey is currently tackling with the introduction of an ambitious color cosmetics and skin care line under the tom ford banner although the stockkeepingunit line is currently bowing in just  doors worldwide the launch is primarily a global play not a us one “tom ford has placed a big bet on china and korea and to a lesser extent japan” says demsey “he sees the future of luxury as heavily rooted in those capital cities in asia” that being said tom ford beauty won’t launch in asia until sometime next year while the brand currently has a strong fragrance and lipstick business with estimated global sales of  million at retail and rich chinese consumers have a predilection for luxury labels from the west fragrance is still a cultural anomaly in asia “we deliberately held off on the asian articulation of the brand to make sure we understand everything that is working and to make sure it goes into the marketplace in the right way” says demsey the launch of tom ford is ambitious to be sure but demsey has proven himself to be an able brand builder over the years when he took over mac in  it had an estimated wholesale volume of  million today industry sources estimate its wholesale volume at more than  billion the npd group reports the brand is ranked number one in prestige color and is number one in the lip and eye categories number two in foundation and number five in mascara those figures exclude sales in mac’s own stores demsey declined to comment on the sales figure but does note that the mac aids fund raised about  million when he first arrived a figure which has risen to  million collectively today  at million of that in the last fiscal year alone   although sources estimate tom ford’s makeup and skin care is expected to hit  million in firstyear sales — a pittance compared to lauder’s billiondollar behemoths — the company has thrown the full weight of its support behind it “new brands today are the big brands of tomorrow” says william lauder chairman of the estée lauder cos “i remember being asked to speak once about mac and niche brands at a conference and my comment was ‘every brand has a niche some are bigger than others the characterization of mac as niche still holds today — it just has a very nice niche” demsey is modest about the brand’s success “when i first got to mac leonard lauder told me to make it more mac than it ever was i thought ‘whatever that means’” he laughingly remembers demsey has a droll manner when speaking and he tends to think as others write — in fully formed paragraphs that segue crisply from one thought to the next each point building upon theprevious to substantiate the original hypothesis it’s a mana gerial style under which people either thrive or wilt associ ates say many of his key team members have been with him for plus years and laud his leadership technique still for others his flashes of steeliness can be offputting says james gager who today is senior vice president and group creative director of the mac la mer and jo malone brands and who was one of the first people demsey tapped for mac “i’m not for everybody as a person i’m a very specific guy what i admire about john is that he truly understands what i bring to the party and i could say that about john as well he’s not for everybody either but he brings special skills to whatever situation he is in and that’s important in terms of being a success and a leader” he’s also not afraid to take risks jennifer balbier senior vice president of global product development for artistry brands remembers the birth of mac’s mineralize line “i found a complex in our lab comprised of  minerals fermented in yeast water and a little factory in italy — who we didn’t do business with — who could bake it” she recounts “bare escentuals was starting to explode but i was having a hard time getting anybody interested i took it to john who believed in my vision and said ‘let’s do it’” the risk paid off today mineralize is one of mac’s biggest franchises as demsey delved deeper into mac he began to fulfill leonard lauder’s mandate “i came to understand what he meant that the life force of the brand was its counterculture beginnings and the focus on the makeup artist and the theatricality and that the heart and soul was the mac aids fund” he says demsey eschewed traditional beautyindustry brandbuilding strategies such as print advertising and focused instead on building a passionate community of acolytes using the credo all ages all races all sexes “we built the brand on word of mouth and on a community social relevance platform that was in a fashion context” he says though this was the prefacebook age the brand was able to effectively harness the rise of social media because it already had such a loyal community particularly among makeup artists “the fashion outreach the events the popculture icons — those were the underpinnings of mac” demsey says “add into that when the internet and community and blogs became a driving force for how you communicate brand and suddenly you have a brand that didn’t advertise except for viva glam becoming the most active brand in the online community because it was authentically sitting in the middle of the content for mac that was another gamechanger not by design but because it was authentic and organically there”   mac became synonymous with fashion — it was the original and is still one of the most involved beauty sponsors of fashion week both in new york and worldwide — as well as pop culture demsey tapped everyone from lil kim to lady gaga to star as the faces of viva glam the mac lipstick whose proceeds are completely funneled to charity demonstrating an ability to recognize star potential that rivals that of a teenager   “john is tapped in not just because he’s a marketer but because he’s a consumer” says sarah brown vogue’s beauty director “when he signed nicki minaj i was only vaguely aware of her and he said ‘no she’s going to be big’ look at her now a year later” brown says of the budding superstar “the same thing with lady gaga” she continues “he has incredible instincts for what is going to explode and sell here’s this guy in a beautifully tailored suit who looks like a businessman and is a businessman but he’s also a voracious consumer of pop culture” when asked what he spotted in minaj that wasn’t immediately apparent to others demsey turns unchar acteristically reticent — “my niece is a fan of lil’ wayne she enlightened me” — and he likewise refuses to name names when asked for potential phenoms on the rise the amount of media that demsey digests is astonishing in its scope “i watch a lot of tv i go to a lot of theater when i’m home late at night and reading and on my computer i multitask i watch morning joe cnn msnbc cnbc the today show i like watching talk shows like oprah or ellen or kelly and regis i like reality tv and the housewives” demsey ticks off “i get all of the top celebrity magazines for the us the uk france i get spanish and italian vanity fair i like to read point de vue to see what the royalist european point of view is i surf youtube and i always look at billboard to see what the top songs are in each country if you look at fashion at celebrity at music that tells you a lot about where people’s minds are” demsey pauses to take a breath “when i travel i want to know what’s going on so i go a day in advance” he continues “i ask the office to have in my room a stack of  or  magazines from lifestyle to fashion to celebrity and i’ll turn on mtv no matter what the language is i always go to the hot neighborhood just to sit and see what people look like i’m also addicted to going on the sartorialist you learn a lot — street culture and pop culture infuse themselves into what’s commercial” demsey is continually filtering the new developments he picks up around the world and has successfully applied many of those lessons to mac “if you look at mac most of the successes we have around the world there is generally a flagship store that we own which is not a beauty concept it’s a fashion concept” he says “the decision to make mac into a retailer was a defining tenet that to this day matters for the brand”   demsey actually began his career in retail clocking time at bloomingdale’s macy’s and saks before joining the brand side he points to recent phenomenons such as popup stores flash sales underground stores and crowdsourcing as factors that are changing the way he approaches the sector “retailing is becoming interesting” he says “people want to go to new environments and discover new things people don’t just want to be sold product they want brand experiences they want feelings they want to have a good time“the forms of commerce and communication and luxury and prestige and aspiration are starting to blur” he continues “it’s incredibly exciting and incredibly tricky it’s a very fine line between what’s prestige what’s masstige what’s mass and how they cross over” out of the blurring must come extreme focus “in the midst of all this clutter” he maintains “you must go back to the brand story a longterm business isn’t sustainable unless you’ve got a strong brand story and can keep telling it in new ways and keep it fresh over and over and over again” like his sister brand clinique demsey has successfully tapped into the power of national television advertising to tell the estée lauder story “if you would have told me four years ago that the big news in marketing cosmetics was broadcast i would have been surprised” he deadpans another fundamental change he grapples with balancing is the incredible fragmentation of media “you used to be defined by whether you advertised or didn’t advertise or whether you were a wordofmouth brand or not or if you were on a paid for media basis or an earned media basis” he says “what community online and youtube have done is level the playing field just having a lot of money doesn’t mean you’re going to win the communications game strategic media tactics — in terms of breaking through the clutter — and ideas and brand stories matter a lot” one such brand story is smashbox beauty cosmetics the hollywoodbased makeup brand the estée lauder cos acquired in may  for a reported  million to  million demsey had long known its founders dean and davis factor the greatgrandsons of makeup legend max factor and helped spearhead the acquisition “i thought smashbox had a unique opportunity to institutionalize the hollywood makeup position which has been lost” he says “i also liked that they’re in the distribution that most of my brands are not i know that people who buy my brands also shop in those channels” he continues referring to smashbox’s primary outlets such as qvc sephora and ulta “the development of smashbox and the changing distribution patterns in terms of what you consider prestige to be or multispecialty retailing is an important evolutionary step in terms of the estée lauder companies’ approach to an important segment of the market” demsey also sees huge potential for smashbox in asia where it is virtually nonexistent “in the time we were associated with stila the one part of the world where it was very successful was japan and hong kong and taiwan and that was not a hollywood position the way that this is” he says “so i know that a hollywood position done correctly is commercial”   above providing the potential for another brandturnaround success story smashbox — which also encompasses a photo studio and for which celebrity pho tographer davis factor continues to be a creative force — most of all epitomizes the personal and professional passions that drive demsey an ardent photography enthusiast whose extensive collection lines the walls of his upper east side town house demsey is driven by the coupling of the creative with the business to wit in one swoop he recently bought four pictures during a day of management meetings “fred langhammer lauder’s chief executive officer from – used to say that nothing good comes without growth” demsey muses “this is not just an exercise in branding it’s the convergence of business dynamics creativity intuition marketing and brand development the reason why i love my job so much is the leftbrain rightbrain thing” he continues “to be successful today you have to be able to do both” the demsey doctrine  key points i want my mtv popular culture drives mass consumption being plugged in— to movies music art style celebrity—is crucial shock and awe big ideas like tom ford for estée lauder can make an instant difference in a business where perception and reality are closely aligned beauty is aspiration period demsey’s not selling lipstick he’s selling the universal desire to be beautiful that exists across all price points all retail channels and all geographies fun and games women shop because they like to have new experiences—not because they need a new product retail must deliver a memorable moment the level playing field in a

a break is about the last thing you’d realistically be doing we know this from our afternoon with john demsey executive group president at the estée lauder companies inc and the man behind the branding and direction for a handful of brands you’ve probably heard of like mac tom ford beauty crème de la mer which he oversaw up until about six months ago clinique bobbi brown le labo glamglow jo malone london rodin olio lusso smashboxand on and on he’s the creative genius orchestrating every havetohaveit mac collaboration and he was instrumental in the growth of the idea of backstage beauty at fashion week in other words he’s kind of a big deal when you consider the role beauty plays in the digital age—its popularity and how beauty has spawned a billion and one countercultures—you realize exactly how much influence someone like demsey has on contemporary culture after spending an afternoon with him we think he realizes it too and he takes it all very very seriously—even though at the end of the day it’s all just fragrance and makeup from where he finds inspiration and how he stays current to the best advice he’s ever received we basically got a masterclass in how to be successful as a creative in business settle in friends—this one is good    view morehis role at estée lauder “i’m executive group president here at the estée lauder companies—we’re responsible for the development of the creative direction and backbone of the company across all brands i’m often referred to as the creative of the suits and the suit of the creative guys i sit in an unusual hybrid role basically my role here is that i’m the brand guy “i became a group president  years ago the first aspect was that i took over the global lead of the estée lauder brand and i brought tom ford into the company and used tom ford to help reimagine the estée lauder brand he set the platform for the reinvigoration and aspiration of the brand making it sexy and interesting and relevant to another generation in the process i developed a really close working relationship with tom ford and helped him launch his own brand ten years ago i launched tom ford beauty today it’s the fastestgrowing designerbeauty brand in the world”     the pivotal moment in his career “basically my life changed in   was when our company went public and the first company that we bought was mac cosmetics—in  we took full control of the company “i would probably say that that move which was  years ago changed the course of my entire career changed the course of me as a person and my role here at the company i moved to canada commuted i had never developed a product and i had never run a fullfledged business i had never been in a global role mac was a niche business with a big reputation subsequently over the past  years i’ve built the most amazing team of people to work with who are actually making mac into the biggest color brand today that informs the backbone of everything i’ve learned in retail brand building merchandising product development international market development business development all things related to global business i learned on the job doing that”   “wherever i go i have a stack of the international fashion magazines in the local language waiting for me in my hotel room”    view more view morethe abcs of brand building “i made the decision to build out mac as the ultimate makeup authority and backstage fashion resource which took us from doing a couple of shows in london and paris to the largest participant backstage doing over  shows every season working with every major designer and every major makeup artist in the world i took the artists and used them to conceptualize what the product offerings were where most companies do product testing on consumers i made the decision to test products on the front line with the artists where they’re used the most and the people using them know the most about competitive products that was transformative “the other thing was that when i arrived there the charity called the mac aids fund and the viva glam campaign had raised interest with rupaul—the original voice of the brand i made the decision to take the charity and make it the heartbeat of the emotional side of the brand in  we embraced hiphop culture at that time with mary j blige and lil kim that was the very first time that a fashion brand let alone a beauty brand tapped into the seismic quake that was taking place all over the world that’s what got it started in  in the numberone song from tlc called ‘unpretty’ there was a lyric in the song that went ‘it doesn’t matter how much mac you wear’ it had seeped into the popular culture that was my lightning rod “every brand we have has its own unique playbook the strength of this company has been that we have the best portfolio of beauty brands in the world we have over  brands that are the envy of everyone else in the world the job that we do means they’re distinct they’re unique the ones that are successful all have an elevator pitch if i can’t give you the elevator pitch then i’ve lost you”    view morenothing beats an irl experience “wherever i go i have a stack of the international fashion magazines in the local language waiting for me in my hotel room the vogues elles harper’s of the world i have a stack of the local fashion and also the celebrity rags hello us weeklys i turn on the television i get a copy of billboard to look at the charts to see which artist is selling in that country then if i have the time i ask a taxi driver to show me where the rich people live show me where the kids live and show me where the counterculture is even if it’s going to the club or going to a cafe i want to see what’s considered to be hot and what’s considered to be aspirational when i travel around the world that’s how i get a sense of what the trends are today you could surf the web and do the same exercise i use culture and people as my inspiration “the more experienced you are and the older you get it becomes increasingly challenging to remain connected with the upcoming generation what they want and what’s relevant to them and to not get caught in the paradigms of where you come from being in the beauty industry i’ve always surrounded myself with a lot of smart young women i think it’s incredibly important at the end of the day  of the things we make—that is who is buying our product i have an eight yearold daughter and i’m seeing the world through her eyes i’m seeing how she relates to culture to beauty to makeup to play and that truly inspires me it actually helps me stay very connected in terms of what’s next”    view morebeauty in the age of the selfie “makeup is about personal transformation to whatever you want to be—from natural pretty beautiful goth outrageous makeup and hair are visual forms of self expression generationally with this content avalanche everybody has something they want to say they want to show you how they use it and somehow it has become part of the product innovation cycle and part of how people talk about everything like brows “the whole brow culture the whole contour culture colorcorrecting culture the lip culture the cateye culture the hair weave wig high pony low pony—it just goes on and on and on because the possibilities are endless globally the korean bloggers middle eastern bloggers random people in melbourne australia and quiet girls in japan—they all get to jump on and surf the net it’s created a hypermarketplace for experimentation and beauty because community and online is so individualized you can actually find an audience there may not be a lot of people who are like you but if you can find those people you can create a market out of it and create a business out of it you can communicate to them directly as opposed to the old world where you communicated to everybody in hopes that someone would connect to it “i’m happy that i continue to be surprised by how people relate to our product i’d hate to be jaded sometimes i smile sometimes i laugh sometimes i’m horrified sometimes i’m shocked sometimes i’m inspired seduced it’s very interesting just when i think i’ve seen it from every angle or i’ve seen it all i haven’t which means that possibility is endless “the proposition that makes almost every company we have here unique is the fact that there is a hightech hightouch interaction between a customer and the brand itself oneonone customization is actually the fastestgrowing sector of our online businesses the uberization of service at home or service in the office or makeup on the fly is happening the thing that is unique about the world which is not unique to beauty is that access and community are everywhere people expect it on their terms when they want it the companies that aren’t able to do it will probably be left behind there’s a different expectation today” “just when i think i’ve seen it from every angle or i’ve seen it all i haven’t which means that possibility is endless”    view more view moreon aligning with the right people “for mac the mantra of the brand is all ages all races all sexes which encompasses everything mac is about standing for something having a strong point of view no judgement and being unapologetic when we look for celebrities or designers or tastemakers sometimes they may seem fringe or polarizing but they’re always interesting and topical and never pandering we take a very editorial point of view we try to bring a lot of people into the tent it’s very inclusive and exclusive at the same time the one thing that everyone has coming into the tent is that they share a passion for makeup and selftransformation “if you look at any of the viva glam spokespeople from boy george to arianna grande to chloë sevigny to lady gaga they all share a core ethos in terms of selfconfidence and a strong voice and point of view the designer collaborations are highlow we had a collection with zac posen in february with giambattista valli a year ago this week we’re launching the trolls and there’s a collaboration with the next star trek movie and then there’s something with cindy sherman you go from the whitney to troll dolls bouncing around in an animated flick it’s that combo of highlow mixed with professional authentic real relationships coming together”   the people he admires “i admire a whole suite of the newmedia executives—facebook google uber amazon all these new things the jeff bezos thinking—it may not be my paradigm but it’s a very interesting paradigm and it makes you think of the world very differently the notion of what google does the way that amazon changed my personal shopping habits ordering a car on uber ordering something with one click i find it all incredibly inspiring and creative”    view morehis favorite collaborations “i’ve been proud of all of them but we were the first people to identify lady gaga and nikki minaj which is where i probably felt most ahead of the curve we actually discovered them before anybody knew who they were we discovered lady gaga because she was actually going to a mac store one of the nightclub personalities was one of her friends and she came onto our radar when she was doing the underground clubs of new york she wanted to meet us she was living on the upper west side and was crossing the park to go to sacred heart and she saw boy george in the window and said she wanted to be that one day generally people come to us which is the best because then you know that you have that credibility we’re not always looking to hitch our lucky star onto something we’ve been lucky in that the stars have wanted to hitch onto us”   “you need to take a track that you should almost be paying them for the opportunity to do it and view it as almost the ultimate graduate school”   how to become john demsey and why you should brush off the haters “i ended up here by grand design and by accident i actually didn’t get the job i wanted when i wanted i wanted to work here i graduated from business school and if i didn’t get a job within four months i’d have to move back to ohio i got very motivated very fast i got a job in macy’s executive training program in a field that i really had no real interest in and it was an existential crisis for me i was not successful i was told by the first person that i worked for that i was never going to amount to anything i should go to work for a bank or do something else because i was never going to make it “then by sheer accident a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of the family knew someone at bloomingdale’s i went to work at bloomingdale’s managing the fragrance spritzers on the floor when the giorgio madness hit i met every single person that then took me on the wave for the rest of my career robin burns who brought me to estée lauder leonard lauder people from saks different companies at  years old i basically started the seeds of everything i wanted to and i never looked for a job ever     view more“the notion was that you have to take risks it’s not about the money to begin with when people make it about the money they often make the wrong decisions you need to take the tack that you should almost be paying them for the opportunity to do it and view it as almost the ultimate graduate school what you want is relevant handson experience as opposed to being a cog in the wheel those retail experiences i wouldn’t change those experiences for the world i got more experience with more brands more concepts more entrepreneurs more ideas than i ever would have being slotted into a sales role or marketing role with one company you have to be open accept the curve balls be very focused then unfocused then focused again you have to know yourself at a certain point in your life you know what you’re good at and what you’re not good at you need to support your strengths if you’re good at something or you love something you’ll be successful at it “leonard lauder taught me this you look to the left to the right behind you and you look forward you look back because you want to see what people have done in the past lessons can be learned from the past you look to the left and the right because you need to understand who your competition is who is angling for your place your job your success you look forward to see where you’re going but you need to find a point of view to be able to get there” part of the series deskside view the series most talked about linda rodin makes a
