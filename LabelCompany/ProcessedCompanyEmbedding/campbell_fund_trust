operationsintroduction the campbell fund trust the trust is a business trust organized on january   under the delaware business trust act which was replaced by the delaware statutory trust act as of september   the trust is a successor to the campbell fund limited partnership formerly known as the commodity trend fund which began trading operations in january  the trust currently trades in the us and international futures and forward markets under the sole direction of campbell  company lp the managing operator of the trust specifically the trust trades in a diverse array of global assets including global interest rates stock indices currencies and commodities the trust is an actively managed account with speculative trading profits as its objective effective august   the trust began offering series a series b and series w units the units in the trust prior to that date became series b units series b units are only available for additional investment by existing holders of series b units as of december   the aggregate capitalization of the trust was  with series a series b and series w comprising   and  respectively of the total the net asset value per unit was  for series a  for series b and  for series w critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent however actual results could differ from those estimates the trusts significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  of the financial statements the trust records all investments at fair value in its financial statements with changes in fair value reported as a component of change in unrealized trading gains losses in the statements of operations generally fair values are based on market prices however in certain circumstances estimates are involved in determining fair value in the absence of an active market closing price ie forward contracts which are traded in the interbank market capital resources the trust will raise additional capital only through the sale of units offered pursuant to the continuing offering and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing due to the nature of the trusts business it will make no capital expenditures and will have no capital assets which are not operating capital or assets the trust generally maintains  to  of its net asset value in cash cash equivalents or other liquid positions in its cash management program over and above that needed to post as collateral for trading these funds are available to meet redemptions each month after redemptions and additions are taken into account each month the trade levels of the trust are adjusted and positions in the instruments the trust trades are added or liquidated on a prorata basis to meet those increases or decreases in trade levels liquidity most united states futures exchanges limit fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits during a single trading day no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit once the price of a futures contract has reached the daily limit for that day positions in that contract can neither be taken nor liquidated futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading similar occurrences could prevent the trust from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and subject the trust to substantial losses which could exceed the margin initially committed to such trades in addition even if futures prices have not moved the daily limit the trust may not be able to execute futures trades at favorable prices if little trading in such contracts is taking place other than these limitations on liquidity which are inherent in the trusts futures trading operations the trusts assets are expected to be highly liquid the entire offering proceeds without deductions will be credited to the trusts bank custodial andor cash management accounts the trust meets margin requirements for its trading activities by depositing cash and us government securities with the futures broker and the overthecounter counterparty this does not reduce the risk of loss from trading activities the trust receives all interest earned on its assets no other person shall receive any interest or other economic benefits from the deposit of trust assets   approximately  to  of the trusts assets normally are committed as required margin for futures contracts and held by the futures broker although the amount committed may vary significantly such assets are maintained in the form of cash or us treasury bills in segregated accounts with the futures broker pursuant to the commodity exchange act and regulations thereunder approximately  to  of the trusts assets are deposited with the overthecounter counterparty in order to initiate and maintain forward contracts such assets are not held in segregation or otherwise regulated under the commodity exchange act unless such overthecounter counterparty is registered as a futures commission merchant these assets are held either in us government securities or shortterm time deposits with us regulated bank affiliates of the overthecounter counterparty the managing operator deposits the majority of those assets of the trust that are not required to be deposited as margin with the futures brokers and overthecounter counterparties in a custodial account with northern trust company the assets deposited in the custodial account with northern trust company are segregated such custodial account constitutes approximately  to  of the trusts assets and are invested directly by pnc capital advisors llc pnc pnc is registered with the sec as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  pnc does not guarantee any interest or profits will accrue on the trusts assets in the custodial account pnc invest the assets according to agreed upon investment guidelines that first preserve capital second allow for sufficient liquidity and third provide a yield beyond the riskfree rate investments can include but are not limited to i us government securities government agency securities municipal securities banker acceptances and certificates of deposits ii commercial paper iii shortterm investment grade corporate debt and iv asset backed securities the trust occasionally receives margin calls requests to post more collateral from its futures broker or overthecounter counterparty which are met by moving the required portion of the assets held in the custody account at northern trust to the margin accounts in the past three years the trust has not needed to liquidate any position as a result of a margin call the trusts assets are not and will not be directly or indirectly commingled with the property of any other person in violation of law or invested in or loaned to campbell  company or any affiliated entities offbalance sheet risk the term offbalance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that even though it does not appear on the balance sheet may result in future obligation or loss the trust trades in futures and forward contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of offbalance sheet market and credit risk in entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the trust market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions such as interest rate volatility resulting in such contracts being less valuable if the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions of the trust at the same time and if the trusts trading advisor was unable to offset futures interests positions of the trust the trust could lose all of its assets and the unitholders would realize a  loss campbell  company the managing operator who also acts as trading advisor minimizes market risk through realtime monitoring of open positions diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margintoequity ratio that rarely exceeds  however these precautions may not be effective in limiting the risk of loss in addition to market risk in entering into futures and forward contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to the trust the counterparty for futures contracts traded in the united states and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange in general clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and as such should significantly reduce this credit risk in cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members like some foreign exchanges it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions in the case of forward contracts which are traded on the interbank market rather than on exchanges the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution rather than a group of financial institutions thus there may be a greater counterparty credit risk campbell  company trades for the trust only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy all positions of the trust are valued each day on a marktomarket basis there can be no assurance that any clearing member clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the trust disclosures about certain trading activities that include nonexchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value the trust invests in futures and forward currency contracts the market value of futures exchangetraded contracts is determined by the various futures exchanges and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period the market value of swap and forward nonexchange traded contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of  pm et of the last business day of the reporting period or based on the market value of its exchangetraded

approximately  was due to trading gains before commissions and approximately  due to investment income an analysis of the  gross trading gains for the trust for the year by sector is as follows sector  gain loss commodities   currencies  interest rates   stock indices     the trust had a strong start to  with gains during january in all sectors  interest rates commodities foreign exchange and stock indices the largest gains for january came from long global interest rate positions driven by the trendfollowing strategies as interest rate products rallied during the month widespread deflationary concerns and slowing economic growth led to extraordinary central bank actions during the month the european central bank ecb exceeded market expectations with their quantitative easing qe package and over ten other central banks eased financial conditions as well commodity positions were another source of profits during the month trend following strategies showed gains while nontrend programs produced some offsetting losses short energy exposure was one of the best performing subsectors as the selloff across the energy complex continued unabated both wti and brent each lost more than  during the month in the industrial metal subsector short copper positioning was also a winner as slowing demand and growing inventories sent the price to a five year low precious metals produced the largest offsetting losses as shorts on silver and gold suffered from flight to safety buying during the month foreign exchange contributed additional gains driven by the trend following systems long positioning in the us dollar proved profitable especially versus short the canadian dollar and the euro the canadian central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates pushing their currency sharply lower the ecb announced a larger than expected qe package that sent the euro down to levels not seen since  some offsetting losses were experienced in short swiss franc positioning when the swiss national bank shocked global markets by suddenly removing its threeyear old peg to the euro which sent the franc sharply higher stock index positioning from the trend following systems showed small additional gains during the month gains were found from long positioning in europe and canada where central bank easing provided a boost to equities in those regions   february for the trust was composed of losses in commodities interest rates and foreign exchange offset gains from stock indices the largest losses came from short commodity positions driven by both trendfollowing and nontrend following strategies short energy exposure was one of the worst performing subsectors as the crude complex experienced a significant bounce during the month after a sharp sixmonth selloff signs of falling production refinery disruptions and cold weather helped to squeeze prices higher grain positions added to losses as short positions in corn and wheat were hurt by stronger export sales some offsetting gains were found in the soft commodities a short position in coffee experienced profits as improving weather in brazil boosted prospects for an abundant harvest which weighed heavily on the product interest rate positions were another source of losses during the month trend following strategies showed declines while nontrend programs produced some offsetting gains long positioning within the united states and the united kingdom produced some of the largest losses as better economic data improving inflation trends and less dovish central bank comments pressured markets lower foreign exchange contributed small additional losses short positioning on the british pound versus the us dollar suffered from hawkish uk central bank comments on the back of stronger than expected economic data some offsetting gains came from short euro and short yen positions both versus the us dollar as diverging central bank policy paths continue to provide opportunity for our strategies stock index positioning from both trend following and nontrend following systems showed strong gains during the month global profits were found from long positioning in the us  japan  australia  europe  and canada as a bounce in oil prices alleviated some fears around a global growth slowdown pockets of stronger than expected economic data linked with a tentative resolution to the greek geopolitical crisis fed the riskon sentiment for stocks gains in foreign exchange and commodities led to a profitable march for the trust as profits from foreign exchange commodity and interest rate holdings all contributed while stock index positions produced some offsetting losses during the month the largest profits for march were provided by foreign exchange positions from both trend following and nontrend strategies short euro positioning versus the us dollar was one of the best performing holdings the euro continued to trade lower as the european central banks unprecedented monetary stimulus contrasted sharply with the us federal reserve which many expect to raise interest rates later this year the euro was also pressured lower as greece struggles to secure bailout funds and avert a default other gains came from short positioning on several commodity currencies as the price of oil resumed its downward trend pulling those markets lower commodities were another source of profits during the month short positioning across the energy complex proved profitable as the selloff in those markets began again amid new signs of global oversupply a potential political agreement with iran also threatened to dump even more supply on the already saturated market if western sanctions are scaled back soft commodities were another source of gains short positioning on sugar and coffee produced profits as favorable growing weather increased expectations for plentiful supplies of those commodities small additional gains came from interest rate positions long positioning across longdated global instruments continues to be the theme for positioning within this sector losses in japan and germany were more than offset by gains experienced in the united states  australia  the united kingdom  and canada  global stock indexes showed losses from both trend and nontrend strategies global stocks were mixed during march as some gains in europe  helped by the ecbs quantitative easing program were offset by losses in the us  uk  canada  and australia hampered by a stronger us dollar and falling global commodity prices the trust showed a decline in april as losses from foreign exchange interest rate and commodity holdings all contributed to the decline while stock index positions produced some offsetting gains during the month some of the largest losses for april were produced by foreign exchange positions from both trend following and nontrend following strategies short euro positioning versus the us dollar was one of the worst performing holdings the euro moved higher as weaker us economic data suggested that the us federal reserve will hold off on an interest rate hike longer than expected a calming of concern around the solvency of greece also helped to boost the euro faster reacting nontrend models showed some offsetting gains in the british pound as that currency reversed higher during the month on hawkish uk central bank comments and an improvement in sentiment around their upcoming elections interest rates were another source of losses during the month long positioning across longdated fixed income instruments provided most of the declines as global interest rate products soldoff losses in australia stemmed from hawkish central bank comments and some surprisingly strong economic data concern over ultralow interest rate yields in germany linked with bearish comments from several prominent asset managers caused those bond prices to fall additional declines came from commodity positions short positioning across the energy complex was hurt by rising prices as supply concerns eased and the weaker us dollar was supportive to prices trading in soft commodities namely sugar and coffee also produced losses nontrend strategies produced some offsetting gains within the industrial metals subsector long metals positions benefitted from a weaker us dollar and new chinese stimulus measures which helped to push those markets higher global stock indices showed gains from the trend strategies long positioning on the hang seng index in hong kong was one of the best performing holdings during the month as the index rose almost  hong kong shares rose sharply when chinese regulators allowed mutual funds to buy shares in companies included in the index   the trust showed a decline in may as losses from interest rate and commodity holdings were only partially offset by gains from foreign exchange and stock index positions leaving the portfolio lower on the month some of the largest losses were produced by interest rate positions from both trend following and nontrend strategies long positioning across longdated interest rate products suffered when well established trends sharply reversed during the month some of the largest losses were seen in germany and australia  the german selloff which spilled over into other global interest rate markets was primarily driven by technical factors including liquidity and positioning australia saw some stronger than expected economic data which put pressure on their interest rate markets additional declines came from commodity positions within trend following as nontrend strategies showed some smaller offsetting gains in the sector one of the worst performing subsectors was industrial metals long positioning on copper and zinc suffered from a strengthening us dollar and additional signs of an economic slowdown in china  long positioning on precious metals also suffered from the stronger dollar some offsetting gains came from the grain subsector shorts on both corn and soybeans profited from a drop in prices due to steady planting progress some of the best gains during may were within foreign exchange holdings where both trend following and nontrend strategies showed profits short positioning on the japanese yen versus the us dollar was one of the biggest gains the yen weakened to a year low versus the dollar after a soft first quarter data suggested that the us economy was starting to accelerate leading to speculation that the us federal reserve could raise interest rates later this year for the first time since  global stock indices also showed gains with both the trend and nontrend strategies contributing long positioning on the japanese nikkei  index produced some of the largest sector gains japanese stocks rose steadily throughout the month as the falling yen provided a strong tailwind for stocks the trust showed a sharp decline in june as losses from commodity stock index foreign exchange and interest rate holdings left the trust lower on the month some of the largest losses were produced by commodity positions from both trend following and nontrend strategies short positioning on various grain markets proved unprofitable corn wheat and soybean futures rose sharply due to crop concerns amid heavy rainfall in the midwest these moves were exacerbated by significant short covering in the marketplace energy markets also contributed to losses a short natural gas holding was hurt by signs of slowing production growth stronger power burns and a slowing pace of storage builds which sent the market higher soft commodities showed losses as short positioning on coffee suffered from higher prices amid improved demand prospects and a lowered brazilian output forecast additional declines came from stock index positions within both trend following and nontrend following systems the trust was generally positioned long global stocks during the month with an emphasis on the us and japan  a lack of positive progress on the greek financial crisis near monthend caused a bout of riskoff selling which sent all global stock markets sharply lower leading to losses foreign exchange positioning also detracted from performance as both trend and nontrend strategies saw declines a short new zealand dollar position proved to be a profitable trade given the continued downtrend but most of the other currencies in the trust saw negative performance due to choppy directionless trading in interest rate markets nontrend strategies provided some partially offsetting gains to the losses encountered by the trend systems global bond markets experienced some very choppy price action that was difficult for the trend systems to navigate for example in the us interest rate markets were under pressure early in the month after some better than expected economic data these markets then sharply reversed to the upside later in june driven by safe haven buying amid the worsening greek financial crisis and the uncertainty that it fueled the trust showed a gain in july as profits from commodity and foreign exchange positions more than offset losses experienced on stock index and interest rate holdings some of the largest gains were produced by commodity positions from both trend following and nontrend strategies short positioning within precious metals was one of the most profitable trades during the month gold and silver both fell sharply amid the ongoing strength of the us dollar demand for gold by the chinese government was shown to be much weaker than expected sending the metal to its lowest level in five years short holdings on the industrial metals namely copper also proved profitable copper fell sharply amid growing concerns over the health of the chinese economy the trust experienced some offsetting losses in the grains a long position in wheat suffered as the commodity experienced a harsh selloff due to healthy crop expectations and continued us export weakness additional profits during the month came from foreign exchange positions especially within the trend following systems short positioning on the australian dollar canadian dollar and new zealand dollar commonly referred to as commodity currencies all proved profitable the global commodity weakness seen during july as evidenced by a more than  decline in the sp gsci index a measure of a basket of  commodities pressured all these currencies lower stock index positioning detracted from performance as both trend and especially nontrend strategies saw declines shortterm nontrend models struggled to successfully navigate several riskon  riskoff shifts in the equity markets the greek financial crisis provided some of the market moving news as headlines shifted from dire to hopeful interest rate positions showed a decline during the month as losses from trend following strategies overwhelmed gains from nontrend systems the greek crisis proved to be a major driver of interest rate markets in addition to ongoing expectations that the us federal reserve is getting closer to its first interest rate hike in years   the trust had offsetting gains and losses in august as profits from commodity positions were offset by losses in interest rate positions foreign exchange and stock index holdings had little positive or negative impact on the trust some of the largest gains were produced by commodity positions from trend following systems as nontrend strategies showed some losses in the sector short holdings on the industrial metals namely zinc nickel and aluminum were some of the largest gainers amid growing concern that the chinese economy is in worse shape than previously thought china is a huge consumer of these metals short positions within the energy subsector also proved to be profitable trades during the month with brent and wti among the best gainers chinese growth concerns coupled with ongoing abundant petroleum supplies conspired to put downward pressure on prices the trust experienced some offsetting losses in the precious metals and soft commodities a short position from gold suffered from flight to safety buying amid a sharp decline in global equities a short holding on coffee was hurt in the first half of the month amid concerns surrounding smaller bean sizes in brazil  foreign exchange was relatively flat for august short positioning on the canadian new zealand  and australian dollars commonly referred to as commodity currencies proved profitable the chinese economic slowdown was the catalyst for the selloff in these markets offsetting losses were incurred by positioning in the euro japanese yen and swedish krona stock index positioning had little impact on monthly performance shorterterm faster reacting nontrend strategies showed gains in the sector while trend following systems with longerterm slower indicators showed offsetting losses poor chinese economic data linked with their surprising currency devaluation sent global stocks sharply lower interest rate positions showed a small decline during the month as losses from nontrend strategies overwhelmed gains from trend following systems interest rate markets experienced choppy price action amid riskoff  riskon buying and selling plus continued uncertainty over the timing of the first us federal reserve rate hike in some nine years the trust showed a gain in september as profits from commodity and foreign exchange positions were the primary drivers during the month although both fixed income and stock index holdings also contributed positively to the months profits the commodity sector produced gains during the month primarily driven by nontrend systems some of the best gains were found in short positioning on natural gas wti and brent natural gas sold off on inventory builds along with moderating power demand both wti and brent resumed their selloffs as supplies remained robust while demand especially from china  continued to show signs of slowing a short position on live cattle was also a standout gainer as prices fell amid lower exports and increased supplies some partially offsetting losses were experienced in the sector from the precious metal and grain markets choppy price action for silver produced losses as the strategies failed to find successful trades short positions on both corn and wheat produced losses as those prices rose amid a variety of more bullish news additional gains were produced by foreign exchange positions from trend following systems as nontrend strategies showed some losses in the sector short holdings on the canadian dollar norwegian krone and australian dollar all versus the us dollar were some of the most profitable trades during the month a renewed selloff in the energy complex linked with softness in commodity prices overall helped to drag these currencies lower benefitting the trusts short positioning interest rate positions also added to profits as trend strategies overwhelmed losses from nontrend following systems long positioning on german and japanese longdated fixed income produced some of the best gains buying seen in these markets was driven by safe haven demand amidst the slump in stock prices stock index positioning added a small gain to monthly performance shorterterm faster reacting nontrend strategies experienced gains in the sector while trend following systems produced small losses global growth concerns plus several bearish highprofile stockspecific news items weighed on equities throughout the month the trust showed a loss in october as profits from stock index holdings were more than offset by losses from foreign exchange interest rate and commodity positions during the month foreign exchange positions from trend following strategies produced some of the largest losses for the trust during october the trust held a net long us dollar positioning during the month a weaker than expected september us employment report early in the month caused a us dollar selloff for the first two weeks as expectations for a federal reserve rate hike began to fade longterm downtrends in many of the commodity currencies such as the australian and canadian dollars reversed which led to losses in those currencies nontrend strategies produced some offsetting gains in the sector interest rate positions contributed small additional losses to the trust dovish comments from the ecb head mario draghi and a more hawkish than expected statement from the us federal reserve were the biggest drivers of interest rate markets the trust experienced gains in europe  but more than offsetting losses in the us uk  and asia from trend and nontrend systems alike commodity positions also detracted from the trusts monthly pl nontrend systems showed some strong gains that were offset by losses from trend strategies some of the best gains were found in the energy subsector with a short position on natural gas fueling profits warmer weather and nearrecord inventory levels pushed natural gas sharply lower offsetting losses across the other commodity subsectors left the sector lower on the month overall the best gains during the month came from long positioning on global stock indexes the sharp selloff in global stocks from august and september was reversed during october signs that the us federal reserve was not quite ready to raise interest rates linked with new stimulus from china and expected stimulus from the ecb pushed stock prices sharply higher which benefitted both trend following and nontrend strategies   the trust showed profits in november from commodity foreign exchange and interest rate positions stock index holdings provided some small offsetting losses during the month commodity positions provided some of the best gains to the trust during november with both trend following and nontrend systems contributing some of the best gains were found in the energy subsector with a short position on natural gas fueling profits warmer weather and record inventory levels pushed natural gas prices lower short positioning on brent and wti also added to gains in the energy subsector as supplies remained abundant short holdings on the industrial metals namely copper zinc and nickel also produced solid profits as a stronger us dollar in addition to weak demand and plentiful supplies kept prices under downward pressure other sector gains came from short positioning on corn and wheat as those prices fell amid steady harvest progress leading to expectations for abundant supplies foreign exchange positions from both trend following and nontrend strategies produced additional profits a short holding on the euro versus the us dollar was one of the best performing trades expectations of divergent monetary policies between europe and the us put downward pressure on the euro the ecb is widely expected to provide additional easing measures in december while the us federal reserve is broadly expected to increase interest rates during the same month a short position on the polish zloty also added to profits the combination of potential ecb monetary policy easing depressed energy prices and the expected interest rate increase by the us federal reserve put pressure on the emerging market currencies interest rate positions contributed small additional gains to the trust driven by the nontrend strategies some of the best opportunities were found in germany  the united kingdom  italy  the united states  and canada  some small losses during the month came from stock index positions primarily from nontrend systems a short position on australian spi  was one of the worst trades in the sector december for the trust comprised of losses from interest rate and stock index holdings while foreign exchange and commodity positions provided some smaller offsetting gains interest rate positions provided some of the biggest losses during december with both trend following and nontrend systems contributing some of the largest losses came from the german year and year notes long positioning on these and other global interest rate markets suffered when ecb president mario draghi disappointed markets early in the month traders had widely expected mr draghi to announce major new stimulus measures at the ecbs december meeting when he failed to live up to the high expectations major bond markets saw a sharp reversal in trend leading to losses for the sector the nontrend systems had a particularly difficult time navigating the choppy price action that occurred after the disappointing ecb announcement some additional losses during the month came from stock index positions primarily from the trend systems long positioning on global stock indexes especially within europe  were hurt by the underwhelming ecb stimulus announcement many major european indexes finished december with losses greater than  for the month foreign exchange positions from both trend following and nontrend strategies produced some offsetting profits one of the best performing holdings was a short position on the canadian dollar versus the us dollar the canadian currency is closely tied to the price of wti and was dragged lower by the selloff in the oil market trend following and nontrend strategies each produced some small gains in the commodity sector short positioning within the energy complex proved profitable as those markets remained under pressure amid high supply and anemic demand the unseasonably warm weather also weighed on those products used for home heating such as gasoil short positioning on the industrial metals namely aluminum zinc and copper produced some losses as oversold conditions led to a bounce in prices  for the year ended december  of the  return for year ended  for series a approximately  was due to trading gains before commissions and approximately  due to investment income offset by approximately  due to brokerage

w approximately  was due to trading gains before commissions and approximately  due to investment income offset by approximately  due to brokerage fees management fees performance fees service fees offering costs and operating costs borne by series w an analysis of the  gross trading gains for the trust for the year by sector is as follows sector  gain loss commodities   currencies  interest rates  stock indices       the trust had losses in january with gains from interest rate and foreign exchange holdings only partially offsetting declines from stock index and commodity investments the largest losses for january came from long positioning in global stock indexes by the trend following strategies dampened growth momentum in china weighed on global risk assets and deepened the negative sentiment toward the emerging markets the peso devaluation in argentina helped push contagion fears to the forefront and added to the selloff somewhat softer employment and housing data in the us called into question the economic growth momentum seen in the second half of  the us feds further tapering of quantitative easing only added to the global unease for risky assets like equities commodity holdings also produced losses primarily from nontrend strategies energy markets were among the largest losers as the models failed to profitably navigate a volatile trading environment the volatility was caused by varying crosscurrents including inventory data cold weather and shifting production expectations industrial metal losses came primarily from positions in copper and nickel which fell on the weaker chinese economic data and resulting emerging market fallout short exposure to gold also produced losses amid safehaven buying and improving physical demand interest rate positioning was successful during the month with trend strategies showing the best gains some of the largest profits came from long positioning on longdated instruments primarily in europe and the united states as investor sought the safety of interest rate instruments amid growing global uncertainties foreign exchange holdings also produced gains during the month the best performing position was a short holding on the canadian dollar the bank of canada downgraded its inflation outlook for  pushing the canadian dollar to a four year low versus the us dollar the trust also profited from a short position on the south african rand which experienced steep losses due to the significant depreciation of emerging market currencies seen during the month the trust continued its losses in february with gains from interest rates not enough to offset losses from foreign exchange and commodity holdings foreign exchange positions produced some of the largest losses with trend and nontrend strategies contributing short positioning in the new zealand dollar and australian dollar both versus the us dollar caused the most significant losses the new zealand dollar strengthened after some stronger than expected economic data and hawkish comments from their finance minister the reserve bank of australia shifted their monetary posture from one of easing to a more neutral stance helping to push the aussie dollar higher rising commodity prices during the month also provided a tailwind to these socalled commodity currencies other large losses for the month came from commodities where the trust experienced declines across most of the subsectors and from both trend and nontrend strategies short positions in precious metals produced the largest losses when silver and gold both rallied sharply on safehaven buying as geopolitical fears rose due to unrest in ukraine  industrial metals also contributed as a weaker us dollar provided upward price pressure hurting shorts short positioning in gasoline especially early in the month hurt the trust as prices rose due to decreasing stockpiles and curtailed production soft commodities namely short positioning in sugar also caused losses as drought conditions in brazil created supply concerns interest rate positioning provided small offsetting gains profits were found in long holdings on longdated instruments japanese government bonds rose as a combination of weaker economic data and further corporate lending activity by the japanese government helped to push prices higher german notes benefitted from tame inflation data and safehaven buying amid geopolitical turmoil in the region stock index holdings were relatively flat on the month the nontrend strategies detracted from positive trend following performance as some short positioning in asia and parts of europe was hurt by a sharp bounceback rally after the january selloff the trust closed out the quarter with continued losses in march the worst declines came from interest rate stock index and foreign exchange holdings some of the largest losses for the month came from interest rate positions where trend strategies produced the declines while nontrend strategies showed some offsetting gains a bulk of the sector losses were found in long positioning on longdated instruments around midmonth the us federal reserve announced additional tapering of quantitative easing qe and even hinted that an outright rate increase might occur sooner than expected sending interest rate markets sharply lower and hurting portfolio positioning stock index positions also produced losses with both trend following and nontrend strategies contributing trend strategies held long positioning on the nasdaq  index which suffered due to technology valuation concerns a tightening of stimulus by the us fed and uncertainty over russias annexation of crimea and recent display of territorial aggression nontrend strategies went short the hang seng index in hong kong  which fell for the first half of the month only to reverse higher on expectations for new stimulus measures in china to combat slowing growth within the country foreign exchange positions showed gains within the nontrend strategies however trend strategy losses in the sector overwhelmed them leading fx into the red for the month the trust was positioned short us dollars when the us fed surprised markets with hawkish language following the march fomc meeting this caused the dollar to rally sharply against other currencies resulting in losses in the sector commodity positions produced losses from the trend following strategies while nontrend systems produced some offsetting gains some of the worst performing subsectors during the month included energy and industrial metals the trust was long crude which declined amid slower chinese growth natural gas longs fell on expectations for warmer temperatures in the us some offsetting gains were found in long grain positioning as the subsector posted its best quarterly rally since    offsetting gains and losses leave the trust slightly lower in april profits from commodities and to a lesser extent from interest rates were offset by losses from foreign exchange and stock index holdings some of the largest losses during april came from foreign exchange positions the nontrend strategies produced the bulk of the declines while trend strategies showed some gains in the sector the nontrend strategies struggled with price action that was not favorable for the underlying model signals the trust was short japanese yen when the us fed minutes dampened bets that us policy makers were moving towards raising interest rates causing the yen to appreciate trend following strategies profited from a long position on the british pound which rose to multiyear highs stock index positions also produced losses within the nontrend strategies while the trend following programs showed some offsetting gains the nontrend models were positioned long the japanese nikkei index when the bank of japan disappointed markets with no new stimulus causing a selloff in japanese equities the german dax index also contributed to losses as the nontrend strategies built long exposure only to see the index trade lower as renewed ukrainianrussian unrest rattled investors commodity positions produced the best gains seen during the month as both nontrend and trend strategies produced profits nickel was a strong performer for the trust as it trended higher throughout the month indonesias ongoing export ban and ukrainian unrest helped to push the metal to a month high gains also came from long coffee holdings which rose on brazilian production concerns natural gas was another market that produced solid gains especially within the nontrend programs cool spring temperatures and inventory concerns led to the rise in prices interest rate holdings added to gains during april losses from short holdings on shortdated instruments were more than offset by gains from long positions on longdated instruments a combination of pockets of softer economic data linked with the civil unrest in eastern europe helped to propel prices higher during the month the trust showed gains in may led by interest rate and equity index positions profits from interest rate and stock index positions were somewhat offset by losses from commodity and foreign exchange holdings the largest gains for may came from positioning in global interest rates driven by trend following strategies profits were seen in longdated instruments where the trust held long positions while small losses came from shortdated holdings where the trust was generally short fixed income instruments rallied during the month amid pockets of weaker than expected global economic data and as global central banks once again indicated accommodative monetary policies overall market positioning also played a role in the rally as some investors found themselves underinvested in global bonds and some hedge funds scrambled to cover shorts amid the rising prices long global stock index positions also produced gains for the trust during may primarily driven by trend following strategies stocks showed choppy price action during the first half of the month but then staged a rally as dovish global central banks and a surge in merger  acquisition activity pushed many global indexes to new highs commodity holdings produced the largest monthly losses with both trend and nontrend strategies contributing the worst performing subsector was the grains where long positioning in wheat and corn suffered amid weak export sales favorable planting weather in the us and easing tensions between ukraine and russia  base metals trading proved unprofitable amid choppy price action a long position in coffee suffered as steady harvest progress in brazil and a healthy global supply outlook pushed prices sharply lower after an almost  runup this year foreign exchange holdings produced losses primarily from trend strategies as nontrend strategies showed gains some of the worst performing fx holdings included long positions in the euro and british pound european central bank president draghi signaled that policy makers are ready to expand stimulus resulting in a weakening of the euro and the bank of england indicated that a rate hike was not as imminent as markets had been expecting causing the pound to fall from multiyear highs the trust closed out the quarter with gains in june profits from stock index commodity and foreign exchange positions were somewhat offset by losses from interest rate holdings the largest gains for june came from positioning in global stock indexes driven by both trend following and nontrend strategies long positions in north american stock indexes benefitted from dovish comments from federal open market committee head yellen despite pockets of stronger economic data strong merger and acquisition activity also provided a tailwind for us stocks a long equity holding in taiwan showed profits as chinese data indicated signs of improving growth smaller offsetting losses came from long european holdings where a rash of weaker than expected economic data and falling confidence readings overwhelmed new european central bank stimulus actions commodity holdings produced additional monthly gains with only trend strategies contributing some of the best monthly gains came from long positioning on zinc which surged in price amid a sharp drop in stockpiles long energy exposure especially to brent and crude rose as instability in iraq rattled oil markets cattle prices rallied to a record high on lingering supply concerns benefitting the trusts position offsetting losses came from short positions on precious metals as prices rose on a blend of geopolitical instability and ongoing accommodative us monetary policy foreign exchange holdings produced profits primarily from trend strategies as nontrend strategies showed losses some of the best performing fx holdings included a long position on the new zealand dollar which strengthened when the reserve bank of new zealand lifted borrowing costs for the third time this year long positioning on the british pound benefitted when the bank of england boe hinted it may raise interest rates sooner than expected a surprise interest rate cut in mexico hurt the trusts long positioning on the peso interest rate trading showed losses during the month with most declines coming from nontrend strategies hawkish comments from boe head carney caused a sharp selloff in gilts which hurt the trusts positioning rising australian fixed income prices also hurt nontrend strategies which expected prices to fall   the trust showed little change during july with profits from commodity positions more than offset by losses in interest rates and foreign exchange the largest gains for july came from positioning on commodities driven by trend following strategies grain markets were among the best performing subsector led by corn and wheat where the trust held short positioning corn and wheat both dropped sharply during the month fueled by favorable weather which bolstered production expectations long positioning on industrial metals produced additional gains zinc rallied to a near threeyear high on supply concerns after stockpiles fell to a multiyear low unfavorable price action within energy markets produced some of the largest offsetting losses within the commodity sector foreign exchange holdings produced some of the largest monthly losses primarily from trend strategies as nontrend strategies showed some offsetting gains long positioning on the new zealand dollar and the british pound produced losses as those central banks dampened expectations for higher interest rates short positioning on the euro versus the us dollar was one of the best performing fx markets for the trust a policy split between the us federal reserve us fed and the european central bank ecb helped weaken the euro versus the dollar the ecb is fighting falling inflation with an accommodative policy while the us fed is steadily removing stimulus interest rate trading showed losses during the month with declines from nontrend strategies overwhelming trend gains cross currents from rising geopolitical risks clashed with some better than expected economic data and a higher than expected inflation reading in the united states  the nontrend strategies failed to profitably navigate this choppy price action especially in the us and germany  stock index holdings were relatively flat in july positioning was long across the three major geographic regions asia  europe  and north america  some gains were seen in asia  the us and canada on improving economic outlooks while losses across europe were fueled by growth concerns which led to lower prices interest rate and foreign exchange positions lead the trust to strong gains in august profits from interest rates foreign exchange and stock indices were only slightly offset by small losses in commodities the largest gains for august came from long positioning on longdated interest rate markets driven by trend following strategies the largest profits were found within europe and the united states  an escalation of geopolitical tension in ukraine  syria  and the gaza strip provided a safehaven buying tailwind weaker economic data in europe  especially within germany  and a dovish speech by ecb president draghi provided an additional boost to rate markets smaller profits were seen in canada  japan  and australia  foreign exchange holdings produced additional gains from both trend and nontrend strategies some of the best performing fx holdings were short positions on the euro and japanese yen both versus the us dollar the dollar outperformed most of its g peers during the month as better than expected us economic data and commentary from fomc officials continued to point toward a hawkish future change in interest rate guidance meanwhile central banks in europe and japan continued to beat a dovish drum which acted to weaken those currencies versus the dollar long stock index positioning tacked on additional gains positions within the us and taiwan were among the best performing holdings improving us economic growth and bullish merger and acquisition activity helped propel some us indexes to record levels the index in taiwan was helped by strong rallies in semiconductor and electronic component shares commodity holdings created small losses during august gains from short positioning across the energy complex were more than offset by losses from various holdings within the industrial metal grain and meat subsectors nearterm trend reversals within copper zinc wheat and cattle contributed to the offsetting losses the trust showed strong gains again in september profits from foreign exchange and commodity positions were only partially offset by losses on interest rate and stock index holdings the largest gains for september came from foreign exchange positions primarily within trend following strategies diverging central bank policy paths were a major fx driver during the month the bank of japan and the european central bank are both focused on keeping interest rates low while the us federal reserve is starting to hint at higher interest rates the trust was positioned short the japanese yen and euro versus the us dollar and benefitted from these sharply different policy paths commodity holdings from the trend strategies produced additional gains while nontrend positioning showed some offsetting losses during the month some of the best gains came from short positioning on corn and wheat both of which made new multiyear lows during the month short positioning across the energy complex and precious metal markets proved profitable as a persistently stronger us dollar helped to push those markets lower nontrend strategies struggled with the persistent downtrend in the grain complex and also saw losses in the precious and base metals interest rate holdings produced losses from both trend and nontrend strategies some of the largest losses were found on long positioning within the united states  leading up to the midmonth fomc meeting us interest rate products soldoff over concerns that the committee would shift their interest rate guidance to reflect a more hawkish view other losses were seen in stock index positions where trend following signals produced declines while nontrend signals produced some offsetting gains trend following strategies produced losses from long positioning on global stock indexes with the exception of japan where a sharply weaker yen led the nikkei index to solid gains more nimble nontrend systems quickly initiated short positioning and benefited from the selloff across asia ex japan  as the chinese economic slowdown and unrest in hong kong near monthend pushed regional indexes sharply lower   the trust continued to show strong gains during october profits from interest rate commodity and foreign exchange positions were somewhat offset by losses on stock index holdings the largest gains for october came from long global interest rate positions global growth fears gripped markets early in the month and drove fixed income products higher persistent economic weakness across europe and asia sparked concerns that the us economic recovery could be negatively impacted sharply falling energy prices also created concern over deflationary pressures which could keep us interest rates lower for longer central banks in japan and sweden enacted additional easing measures during the month to fight slow growth and deflationary forces commodity positions especially from the trend following strategies were another source of profits during the month short energy exposure was one of the best performing subsectors abundant us supplies linked with falling global demand pushed the energy complex lower short positions on precious metals also added to gains as a stronger us dollar and a dampening of geopolitical and ebola fears caused a selloff in gold and silver grains were the worst performing commodity subsector during october short positioning from the trend following strategies on corn and wheat was hurt by market short covering which pushed prices higher reversing the recent multimonth downtrend foreign exchange contributed small gains long us dollar positioning versus the japanese yen and the euro proved profitable diverging central bank policy paths created fresh opportunities for the strategies during october stock index positioning from both trend and nontrend strategies experienced the largest offsetting losses during the month global long holdings early in october suffered from the global stock selloff energy stocks led indexes lower as oversupply and a lack of global demand caused a rout in physical energy prices stock index prices bounced during the second half of the month but by then the strategies had reduced long positioning and were in a more defensive posture in equities overall gains across all major sectors lead to a profitable november for the trust the largest gains for november came from long global interest rate positions within the trendfollowing program global central banks were again in focus as the european central bank head draghi gave his strongest statements yet that the bank could begin a usstyle quantitative easing program in the near future additional stimulus is also expected from the japanese central bank as they continue their long battle over slow growth and deflationary forces commodity positions were another source of profits during the month short energy exposure was the best performing subsector and dominated positive pl within the sector overall both trend following and nontrend following strategies contributed to the energy gains the downtrend in prices within the crude complex continued during november the selloff accelerated late in the month when opec announced that they would not cut production to address the sharply lower prices seen over the past several months the worst performing subsector was industrial metals where nontrend strategies showed most of the losses long positioning on zinc and aluminum suffered as chinese growth concerns linked with low global demand pushed the metals lower foreign exchange contributed additional gains to the trust long us dollar positioning versus the japanese yen proved profitable falling japanese inflation and some weaker than expected economic reports weakened the yen significantly versus the us dollar stock index positioning from both trend and nontrend strategies proved profitable during the month global long holdings rose as major central banks namely within china  europe  and japan  continued to provide or gave indications that they would provide additional stimulus the trust realized solid gains in december to closeout a year of strong performance profits came from interest rate foreign exchange and commodity holdings offset mostly by stock index position losses the largest gains for december came from long global interest rate positions within both the trendfollowing and nontrend following strategies global interest rate products rallied during the month as the collapse in crude oil prices has led to a sharp decline in inflation expectations geopolitical uncertainty also helped to boost prices as the russian ruble crisis and uncertainty around the greek political situation drove safehaven buying gains were particularly strong within japan and europe as those central banks remain committed to additional quantitative easing measures foreign exchange contributed additional gains driven by the trend following systems overall long us dollar positioning proved profitable as the us fomc dropped its pledge to keep interest rates near zero for a considerable time as the american economy continued to show signs of strengthening short positioning on the mexican peso versus the us dollar was one of the best performing fx holdings the peso sank in value as plunging oil prices damped speculation that a projected energy boom in the country would attract foreign investment and spur economic growth commodity positions were another source of profit during the month trend following strategies showed gains while nontrend programs produced offsetting losses short energy exposure was the best performing subsector and dominated returns in the sector as short positions in brent and gas oil provided the largest gains oil prices continued to tumble amid the stronger us dollar and opec failed to intervene in the market to stop the slide some offsetting losses were seen within the grains and precious metal commodity subsectors stock index positioning from both trend and nontrend systems proved unprofitable during the month global stock index performance was mixed during the month with most indices losing value the ongoing decline in the energy complex the russian ruble crisis and greek political uncertainty all fueled a general risk reduction in stocks  for the year ended december  of the  return for year ended  for series a approximately  was due to trading gains before commissions and approximately  due to

fees management fees performance fees sales commissions offering costs and operating costs borne by series w an analysis of the  gross trading gains for the trust for the year by sector is as follows sector  gain loss commodities   currencies  interest rates   stock indices     began on a positive note as the trust posted solid gains equity indices and foreign exchange sectors responded to improved economic outlooks in the us and europe and to the promise of aggressive fiscal and monetary policy in asia  commodities were flat on the month and the interest rates sector was the only significant detractor from performance the trust lost on a netlong position in global longterm rates as the sector moved lower on the same macroeconomic drivers that pushed equity markets higher and a general rotation out of bonds and into stocks from a strategy perspective longerterm trend following models were the most profitable strategies in january with other complimentary strategies providing additional returns long global equity positions primarily from european and asian holdings recorded the majority of gains positive data points out of europe included the softening of tough basel iii regulations a largerthanexpected repayment by banks of ltro funds to the ecb spanish and italian bond auctions bringing the lowest yields in months and german zew surveys of sentiment that were much more optimistic in asia  the new japanese government used every possible opportunity to push for a weakening of the japanese yen and a  inflation target to end decades of deflation exporters rallied as the yen weakened throughout the month the trusts short japanese yen position was the most profitable trade in the portfolio during january losses in interest rates were not enough to offset gains as the sector exhibited a generally negative correlation to equities hurting the trusts long position the trust which consists of both trend following and nontrend following strategies profited in february the majority of gains came from the foreign exchange sector while losses in equity index trading offset some of these gains interest rates and commodities had little impact on performance foreign exchange was the most profitable sector contributing well over  to the trust in the uk  the british pound gbp was down over  in february as weak economic fundamentals led moodys to downgrade the uks aaa sovereign debt rating to aa the trust made over  in gbp on a short position against the us dollar the canadian dollar cad also declined over  in february on global riskoff positioning and developments indicating a slowing canadian economy this led to additional gains on a short position against the currency these gains were partially offset by losses from trading in equity indices where long positioning in european indices was unprofitable political uncertainty in the region threatening a smooth recovery caused downward moves in several major indices and reversed recent upward trends trading in north american indices was relatively flat for trend following strategies and losses in the region were driven by faster nontrend following strategies getting caught in volatile market action trading in both interest rates and commodities was relatively flat in february renewed concerns over european sovereign debt and the impending us sequester drove interest rate markets producing small gains for the trust in commodities gains in metals were offset by losses in energies driven by the same macroeconomic factors that impacted the interest rates sector the trusts strategies profited in three of four major sectors traded in march with the majority of gains coming from commodities major economic drivers included chinese and japanese political developments positive economic data in the us  and the bank bailout situation in cyprus  trend following strategies contributed over  to the trust while other nontrend strategies detracted from performance gains in commodities were led by short positions in copper and aluminum as these industrial metals fell sharply during the month copper was pressured by new property tightening measures in china aimed at reining in overheated housing markets aluminum fell on reports that production climbed  in february soft commodities and energies also added to profits as supply and weather data moved markets in the direction of the trusts positions equity indices specifically long positioning in the united states and japan  also added to monthly gains a sharp uptick in us nonfarm payrolls and a downtick in the unemployment rate followed by data indicating a steadily improving us housing market helped push index levels higher japanese stocks rose for a seventh straight month gaining over  as prime minister abes efforts to end deflation began with his appointment of haruhiko kuroda to lead the bank of japan boj positioning in foreign exchange contributed small gains to the trust the most profitable trade continues to be short japanese yen with the new boj governor stating he will do whatever it takes to achieve his goal of a  inflation target within two years   the trust gained in both trend following and nontrend following strategies in april with gains coming from all sectors traded major moves in metals and longdated interest rate markets led gains each adding over  to the trust slow global growth disappointing economic data low or stable inflation rates and continued quantitative easing pushed rates lower and equity markets higher across major markets extending or establishing trends and other alpha opportunities commodity markets recorded the best gains for the trust led by precious metals base metals and energies short positioning in precious metals benefitted from a sharp decline in prices the weakness in gold can be attributed to several factors including low or falling inflation readings concern that european central banks will sell gold reserves to help fund bailout costs outflows from related exchange traded products and signs of slower global economic growth especially in china  the trust began april short precious metals posting the majority of gains on april    when the sector significantly declined at which point the trust began to take profits and reduce its positions long positions on longdated interest rate markets in the us  canada  and australia were also profitable during april disappointing economic data stable inflation falling commodity prices and dovish stimulus policy in canada pushed fixed income prices higher this particularly impacted the longdated rate contracts as they are more sensitive to the interest rate movements than the shortdated rates stock index positions added further gains during the month with long positioning in japan  australia  and the us leading the way japanese and australian markets moved higher on continued central bank easing while us markets bounced around throughout the month but finished higher hitting record highs in the sp  and dow jones industrial average the foreign exchange sector added small gains during the month trendfollowing strategies lost money in the sector but nontrend strategies more than offset those losses by market the japanese yen and new zealand dollar versus the us dollar were the most profitable trades in april the trusts gross trading was basically flat in may gains in stock indices foreign exchange and commodity holdings were offset by losses in fixed income positions both trend and nontrend strategies showed gains in long equity index positions the gains were concentrated in european and us holdings in europe  gains were led by the uk where manufacturing and business confidence data strengthened in the us stocks rose after employmentrelated data showed signs of improvement and consumer confidence measures were also better than expected foreign exchange gains came primarily from long us dollar positions against the south african rand the british pound and the canadian dollar the us dollar strengthened against all major currencies amid better economic data and signs that the us federal reserve may soon begin to taper its quantitative easing qe measures commodity holdings added small additional gains to the trust gains were found in short precious metal positions as both gold and silver declined on concerns over qe tapering and weak physical demand out of asia  grain positions namely long soybean positioning benefitted from strong chinese export sales and us supply concerns unfortunately these gains were mostly offset by losses from industrial metal and energy positions short positions in industrial metals namely copper and aluminum moved against the trust as prices rose due to signs of tightening supply and amid short covering long positioning in natural gas was the biggest loser in energy holdings as prices fell sharply when seasonal demand waned and inventories rose more than expected overall monthly gains were offset by losses in long fixed income positions within europe  the us japan  and canada  primarily from the longdated holdings within the trendfollowing strategies global fixed income prices fell sharply during the month for the same reasons the us dollar strengthened  mainly over concern that us qe measures would begin to wind down in the near future amid strengthening economic data which could cause interest rates to rise the trust had a net loss in june declines in stock indices and foreign exchange were only partially offset by gains from commodities and fixed income the primary focus of global markets in june revolved around the fear that the us federal reserve was beginning to signal that their aggressive qe measures were going to be reduced or tapered amid stronger us economic trends world markets have enjoyed the benefits of the unprecedented liquidity that the us central bank has pumped into the banking system over the past five years however the announcement by fed chairman bernanke on june th that qe tapering could begin as soon as yearend roiled global markets trend strategies showed their largest losses in long equity index positions the losses were spread across all global equity markets as they sold off on the concern that us qe tapering could be expected in the near future nontrend strategies showed gains in foreign exchange positioning but the trendfollowing models produced losses that more than offset any gains the trend strategies showed the greatest losses on the japanese yen and the british pound as both showed sharp trend reversals post bernankes tapering comments midmonth trendfollowing strategies delivered gains in commodities especially within short industrial metals and precious metals positioning concerns over a chinese credit crunch plus fear over the potential impact from qe tapering pushed both types of metals lower gains were somewhat offset by losses from energy positions which generally saw sharp midmonth trend reversals due to the strengthening us dollar amid fears that monetary accommodation would begin to be withdrawn both nontrend and trend strategies showed gains in short positioning on fixed income instruments global fixed income markets sold off sharply on fears over qe tapering the faster reacting nontrend models quickly built short positions and benefitted from the extended declines   the trust had small gross trading losses in july gains from stock indices were more than offset by losses from foreign exchange fixed income and commodities the largest losses during the month were found within foreign exchange holdings primarily from short positioning against the canadian dollar and the new zealand dollar these currencies both appreciated on hawkish leaning central bank comments and amid better economic data the australian dollar produced one of the largest fx gains as the royal bank of australia indicated that they had room to cut interest rates which was supported by tame inflation data short positioning within both short and long dated fixed income instruments also caused losses especially within the trend following strategies members of the us federal reserve including chairman bernanke emphasized to world financial markets that a tapering of qe programs does not necessarily mean a tightening of interest rates this message helped push fixed income instruments higher hurting the trusts short positioning nontrend strategies showed small losses as well commodity positions were another source of losses during july the qe tapering does not mean tightening message helped gold appreciate over  which hurt recently profitable trend following short positioning long positioning gains within energies especially on crude and brent oil offset some of the sectors overall losses new middle east tensions in egypt  early month inventory draws and some favorable economic data in the us all pushed most energies higher on the month long stock index positions helped to mostly offset losses most global stock markets rallied during july driven by expectations for continued monetary support from major central banks generally better than expected second quarter earnings reports and additional signs that global economic growth is improving especially within europe and the us trend following strategies showed solid gains on long positioning within global stock indices however nontrend strategies showed small losses on the sector the trusts losses continued in august gains from interest rates were more than offset by losses from commodities foreign exchange and stock index holdings commodities produced the largest losses on the month led by short industrial metal and precious metal positions improving macro economic data from china  including better than expected industrial production and importexport data pushed industrial metals higher some weaker us economic data including a disappointing july employment report and softer pending home sales sent precious metals higher on hopes for a delay in us federal reserve quantitative easing qe tapering long energy holdings helped to offset some losses as increased geopolitical tensions related to syria drove petroleum markets higher short positions in corn and wheat led to early month profits as healthy harvest expectations sent the grains lower foreign exchange holdings also produced losses during august long positioning in the euro and swiss franc produced the largest losses as both currencies fell due to a strengthening us dollar supported by a hardening of expectations for fed qe tapering and risk aversion driven by geopolitical concerns over syria  nontrend strategies produced some offsetting gains in foreign exchange as short positioning in the canadian dollar and australian dollar proved profitable due to riskaversion long global stock index positions showed profits early in the month as the strength seen in july continued into august unfortunately losses were incurred as concerns surrounding qe tapering by the us fed and new fears over military tensions between the us and syria caused global stocks to selloff throughout the second half of the month nimble nontrend strategies showed profits in stock indexes by quickly getting short the secondhalf selloff as geopolitical fears gripped world markets short interest rate positions produced gains for the trust during august stronger economic data in germany and the uk linked with expectations for us fed qe tapering helped push european and us interest rate instruments lower gains were limited by late month reversals on flighttoquality positioning due to the syrian situation the trusts losses continued in september gains from stock indexes were more than offset by losses from commodity foreign exchange and interest rate holdings commodities produced the largest losses on the month led by long energy and short industrial metal positions a calming of tensions between the us and syria caused a selloff in energy markets reversing the gains seen during august industrial metals gained on the election of a probusiness prime minister in australia and amid some better chinese economic data the nontrend following strategies were long gold which produced some offsetting gains on the us feds surprise decision to delay a tapering of its monthly quantitative easing qe program foreign exchange positions produced losses as well the us dollar was broadly weaker versus most other g currencies during september with the us dollar index hitting a sevenmonth low the largest losses for the trust were found in short canadian and australian dollar positions the feds surprising decision to delay tapering its  billion monthly asset purchase program sparked a sharp rally in these currencies versus the us dollar some offsetting gains were found from long positioning on the british pound and swiss franc versus the dollar interest rate positions primarily short holdings on the shortend of the curve produced additional portfolio losses the feds surprise decision to delay qe tapering some pockets of softer global economic data including a weaker than expected us employment report and reports of a us government partial shutdown near monthend all helped to push fixed income instruments higher during september long stock index holdings produced the only sector gains in the trust during the month a peaceful resolution of the ussyrian crisis renewed confidence that janet yellen would be nominated to be the next head of the us federal reserve and the feds decision to fully maintain qe helped most global stock markets to post solid gains profits were capped by late month concerns about a showdown in washington over government spending that ultimately resulted in a partial shutdown of the us government   the trust had positive performance in october losses from foreign exchange and commodity positions were more than offset by profits from stock index and interest rate holdings the strongest trust gains for october came from long positioning in global stock indexes driven by both trend and nontrend strategies news during the month was dominated by the us government shutdown which resulted after congress failed to pass legislation to fund operations global stocks initially soldoff as washington dysfunction put the country on a potential path to default in addition many governmentsupplied economic reports were cancelled leaving global investors with limited visibility into the health of the us economy however stocks turned higher as expectations for a funding deal grew and when an agreement was announced near midmonth stocks charged even higher interest rate positions namely from longdated holdings also added to monthly profits although nontrend strategies limited gains global fixed income instruments generally moved higher after the us government reopened and default concerns subsided both fixed income and stock investors embraced the idea that any reduction in us federal reserve quantitative easing qe would be delayed into  due to the economic drag the government closure created for growth foreign exchange holdings produced losses as various long positions against the us dollar declined a long position in the canadian dollar was among the worst performing holdings after the bank of canada dropped its tightening bias after they downgraded their economic assessment and pointed to downside risks to inflation commodity holdings produced losses primarily from nontrend strategies the worst performing subsector was energy where a short position in natural gas early in the month was hurt by cooler temperatures the strategies then flipped to long and were hurt when inventories grew more than expected industrial metals also produced losses due to a choppy trading environment the largest gains came from the grains and softs where short positions in wheat and coffee profited from abundant supplies the trusts positive performance continued in november profits from stock index commodity and foreign exchange positions were only slightly offset by losses from interest rate holdings the strongest gains for november came from long positioning in global stock indexes driven by trend following strategies stocks continued their strong yeartodate run during the month as additional easing by global central banks namely the european central bank ecb early in the month and generally better than expected economic data kept a tailwind behind stocks japan showed some of the strongest gains rising over  as the yen weakened benefitting their exportdriven economy a solid rise in us and german stocks also benefitted the trust commodity holdings also produced profits primarily from nontrend strategies the best performing subsector was grains where a long position in soybeans was helped by strong export sales and frostdamaged crops short positions in wheat and corn benefitted from an improving outlook for both us and chinese production and a bearish us government crop report early in the month short positions in precious and industrial metals also contributed to gains less dovish fomc minutes helped revive quantitative easing qe taper fears which pushed the metals lower soft commodities and meats produced some small offsetting losses foreign exchange holdings produced small gains a short position on the japanese yen versus the us dollar benefitted as the yen weakened steadily throughout the month with some weaker japanese economic data and renewed us qe taper fears to blame the worst performing foreign exchange position was a long holding on the euro versus the us dollar which suffered when the ecb surprised markets with an interest rate cut interest rate positions namely from longdated holdings within the nontrend strategies produced losses for the trust during november a choppy global trading environment for interest rate instruments proved difficult for the strategies to profitably trade the trust had a net loss in december profits from stock index and foreign exchange positions were more than offset by losses from commodity and interest rate holdings the largest losses for december came from positioning in global interest rates driven by trend following strategies losses were seen in both shortdated and longdated instruments anticipation that the us federal reserve would begin tapering its quantitative easing qe program came to fruition around midmonth causing interest rates to generally rise throughout december losses were greatest in shortdated instruments where the portfolio had long positioning which suffered from improving economic data and the beginning of the feds qe taper commodity holdings also produced some losses primarily from nontrend strategies the worst performing subsector was industrial metals where short positioning suffered as a rally sparked by increasing optimism over growth in china and the us boosted metal prices some offsetting gains came from short precious metal holdings which continued to trend lower amid the feds move to begin exiting its loose money policy wheat produced the largest gains within the grains as weaker than expected export demand and ample global supplies pushed the commodity to a month low foreign exchange holdings produced gains the largest gains came from short positions on the japanese yen and the australian dollar versus the us dollar the feds decision to begin tapering linked with ongoing easy money policies in japan pushed usdjpy to new multiyear highs the australian dollar fell almost  versus the us dollar long stock index positions produced the largest gains during december primarily driven by trend following strategies global stocks generally sold off in the first half of the month as investors were anxious ahead of the feds qe taper decision stocks rallied sharply post the feds taper announcement as investors digested the news and found themselves underinvested in an improving economic landscape
