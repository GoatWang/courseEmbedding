foundationmark and wanda shefts honor the memory of their black labs by helping animals in need crystal gibson    may th       contributions oftentimes the pets who come into our lives bring us so much love and companionship that when we lose them the hole in our hearts can be hard to fill and while we cannot bring a pet back when he or she has crossed over the rainbow bridge many pet owners look for ways to honor their pets memory and keep his or her spirit alive when mark and wanda shefts lost their two labrador retrievers  onyx and breezy  within seven weeks of each other in  they knew they wanted to find a way to keep the love they had for their dogs alive by helping other animals to do so they founded the onyx and breezy foundation which through donations provides financial support to credible organizations and individuals that benefit the welfare of animals each grant request that comes in is carefully reviewed before being accepted and mark shefts says the foundation receives multiple requests per day  many for veterinary care and medicine that pet owners cannot afford for their pets themselves  the onyx and breezy foundation founders and trustees mark and wanda shefts with their three black labs shadow rio and tuxie photo courtesy of the sheftsand because many of the requests for financial aid are urgent mark tries to turn around completed applications the same day or within a few days of them coming in but with all the inquiries the foundation gets mark stresses that incomplete applications will not be reviewed since its creation in  the onyx and breezy foundation has helped save tens of thousands of animals in a variety of ways from spayneuter programs to getting dogs on death row out of highkill shelters to providing emergency medical care to animals whose owners have fallen on hard times  gladys skip and kyle were all saved from the euthanasia list along with  other dogs at a high kill shelter thanks to the onyx and breezy foundation photo via the foundations facebook pagei remember a young woman who was dying of cancer and her dog needed lifesaving surgery which she did not have the money for mark says when asked if any of the animals his foundation has helped really sticks out in his mind the foundation paid for the surgery and she had her fur baby next to her until the day she died it still brings tears to our eyes heidi a beautiful black lab who was able to be spayed thanks to the onyx and breezy foundation according to the shefts one of the biggest ways that the foundation helps out animals is by funding spay and neuter programs at animal shelters to help alleviate overcrowding thereby reducing euthanasia rates photo via the foundations facebook pageand just who were these beloved family pets that inspired the shefts to set up a foundation in their namethe shefts got onyx as a puppy and say that the moment she came into our lives we learned of a new happiness and love that we never knew beforethe beautiful black lab loved to play but didnt like the water as most labs do and she was as smart as she was loving towards her family onyx passed away on september   at  and the shefts write on the foundations website that words cannot describe the loss and void we still feel to this day she is in our hearts and through this foundation she will live on forever onyx and breezy both passed away in  but they live on in spirit through the onyx and breezy foundation and its efforts to provide funding to animal welfare causes and pets in need photo courtesy of mark sheftsas for breezy she was a black lab puppy who came to live with onyx and the shefts in  when onyx was six years old her nickname was sugar because of her sweet disposition and even when she was diagnosed with a mass cell tumor at the age of five and having to undergo many tests and treatment she stayed as loving and gentle as beforebreezy passed away of cancer in wanda shefts arms at the age of seven the shefts write that she engraved a special place in our hearts with her courage and will to live she was an inspiration to everyone who was lucky enough to know herand part of the way that the shefts have been sure to honor their dogs memory  and especially breezys  is by helping fund the ongoing lymphoma vaccine trial at the university of pennsylvania school of veterinary medicine where breezy received treatment for her cancer the veterinary school claims that the results of the study could have have direct implications on human cancer patients as well thus helping dogs help people oogie was in a highkill shelter in los angeles but with a grant from the onyx and breezy foundation he was flown to manhattan where he quickly found a new home photo via the foundations facebook pagethe shefts are proud to say that that everyone involved with the foundation is a volunteer and that  percent of donations received go directly to help the animalsnot one penny comes out of the donations for administration or fund raising that is paid for by the trustees or by individualcorporate sponsors says mark  a grant from the onyx and breezy foundation allowed the nokill thompson river animal care shelter in montana to buy food for animals awaiting adoption photo via the foundations facebook pagebut like any foundation or charitable organization the biggest challenge they face is keeping the donations coming in we cannot continue our work without donations mark urges we never want to turn away a qualified applicant because of lack of money no donation is too smallif you would like to help out the foundation
