you just have to say no even when it might benefit you financially suppose youre in line to receive an inheritance—shouldnt you welcome it with open arms in some cases there can be good reasons to turn down the money using a qualified disclaimerwhy would you ever not take an inheritance the best reason is to save your family money on taxes by using a qualified disclaimer the assets bypass your estate and go to the next beneficiary or beneficiaries this enables you to preserve your personal estate tax exemption to use in other ways in addition in many states a disclaimer may be used to avoid claims of creditorsthe combined personal exemption for estate and gift taxes is  million in  an amount that is indexed to inflation and normally increases every year that gives most people plenty of wiggle room but for those whose wealth exceeds that amount or who have already used up part of the exemption estate and gift taxes may still be a major concern in addition most money you might want to transfer to grandchildren will be subject to the generationskipping transfer tax gstt the gstt exemption is the same as the estate and gift tax exemption if you were going to pass along assets youve inherited to the younger generation at some point anyway the disclaimer expedites matters the money ends up with the contingent beneficiaries named by the person who was leaving you the inheritance without ever touching your handsto qualify under the strict legal definition of a qualified disclaimer the document must meet these requirements it must be made in writing and signed by the disclaiming party it must identify the property or the disclaiming partys interest in the property that is being disclaimed it must be delivered in writing to the person or entity charged with the obligation to transfer the assets ie the executor it must be written less than nine months after the date the property was transferred or the transferors date of death note that you cant alter who will receive the property youre disclaiming for instance if the contingent beneficiaries are your nephews and nieces you cant redirect the money to your own children the designations made by the person who made the bequest control where they money goesalso you cant disclaim property once youve accepted it for example if you receive money and use a small portion to pay for funeral arrangements for the decedent you cant disclaim the inheritance afterwardsalthough future changes in the tax code might discourage the use of disclaimers for now this is still a viable technique be sure to consult
