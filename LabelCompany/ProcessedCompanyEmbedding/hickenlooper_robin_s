want a tiny home two dozen are rolling into a colorado festival this weekend reconciling class differences in divided nation days before she assumed the title as colorado’s first lady robin pringle hickenlooper made what amounted to her political debut at the governor’s annual address to lawmakers subtle but sure in an understated white dress and colorful scarf she made her way to the front row to sit with other special guests shaking hands and greeting familiar faces not unlike the politicians next to her gov john hickenlooper still gushing from their recent engagement made a point to single her out in the address “as the most beautiful woman in colorado” and at the end the two left the chamber showered in rice tossed by lawmakers as an early wedding sendoff her presence at the speech marked a departure from the prior first lady and signaled a willingness to embrace the role even as she balances her own career as a topranking woman in what she calls a man’s world denver co – february  the new first lady of colorado robin pringle who is in the process of changing her name to robin hickenlooper talked about her life with molly hughes from the denver post from the governor’s office at the state capitol in denver on tuesday february   pringle and governor john hickenlooper were just married in january of this year photo by cyrus mccrimmon the denver post a career in corporate acquisitions and investment prepared hickenlooper well for a political life but she remains cautious about stepping into the public spotlight she is slow to share her own story feeling the new weight in her words and avoids discussion of her own political ideology watch robin hickenlooper’s full interview with the denver post “it’s all different for me i get nervous and i represent john” she said referring to the governor “and the most painful thing for me is for people to say bad things about john so i just have to be a little careful” how she envisions her new role as first lady remains unsettled in her mind “it’s something that i’m still thinking about” she said “to the extent i can … i want to be by his side and enjoy everything with him i’m more than happy to go out there” born robin stevens pringle she grew up outside san francisco as the oldest of three children her mother left her teaching career to raise a family and her father works at a highdollar law practice as an expert in antitrust litigation and attorney for prominent companies the yearold changed her name after marrying the governor one of the most pivotal moments in her life came in ninth grade when she applied to the exclusive phillips exeter academy a boarding school in new hampshire that counts facebook founder mark zuckerberg among its graduates she applied on her own only telling her parents after she was accepted “it was just this sheer determination to make it happen and i did” she said “it gave me a sense of independence and it opened my mind to all sorts of possible experiences” it’s a drive that she connects to successes throughout her career and even her brief stint as an amateur triathlete when she graduated from business school in  she wanted another change and moved to denver she describes landing her job at liberty media in englewood as “a fluke” “i went in and interviewed and they said they never had job openings” she told a wake forest university student in a video posted to youtube “i said ‘great’ i just kept going back in for interviews and one day someone quit and they just gave me the job” in nearly eight years she climbed to her current position as vice president of corporate development for liberty media where she identifies investment opportunities in media and ecommerce companies and helps guide the company’s broad portfolio “she’s real smart but as important to me she’s trustworthy” said jim meyer ceo at sirius xm who worked with hickenlooper given liberty media’s controlling stake in the company “and when she says she’s going to do something she does it” through her company pringle helps leads an effort sponsored by liberty media called the women’s ecommerce network which pairs female entrepreneurs with veteran business leaders mentoring women in the business world is one of her passions but whether she will champion the issue as first lady remains unclear “that will sort of evolve” hickenlooper said for now “it’s really just sort of baby steps into the role let people get to know me let me get to know the role the people of colorado and then i will decide what the most effective way is if i think there is a reason to kind of dive into an issue” the governor and his new wife orbited the same social circles for years — and met a handful of times — but only came together by chance in late  at the museum of contemporary art’s luminosity fundraising gala she recounted the story in the governor’s office one recent day glowing and nervous in the light of the denver post’s video cameras recording the interview “i sat down and i was waiting there” she started only to see the governor walk in the room for an impromptu visit unable to stand with the microphone attached to her dress she lifted her arms to hug him and he leaned down to kiss her “i didn’t want to interrupt but i couldn’t resist” he said with a huge grin “i just was passing by and heard the voices” asked about his marriage the governor said “i could not be happier i feel blessed and lucky i keep telling people i feel like the blind squirrel that found an acorn” she rolled her eyes blushing when he exited she resumed the story “honestly there were like  people in the room — it was a warehouse and a huge party and the room went silent and i forgot who i was and i couldn’t stop talking”she said months after the museum gala the two began dating privately at first and then the governor introduced her as his girlfriend at a party in december  a year later he proposed the couple married jan  in a small ceremonyin denver before meeting the governor hickenlooper said she never before fell in love and started to doubt it existed for her “your friends say ‘oh it is going to happen one day” she said “and i’m three and a half decades into my life and i haven’t even found someone to introduce to my parents and you don’t believe it “and then all of the sudden it does and you stop thinking about whether he’s the one and it’s so natural” she continued emotional as she talked her friends say they can see the difference “it’s just so magical to see her fall in love with john and have john love her so much” said emma fuerst frelinghuysen a longtime friend who met hickenlooper in san francisco after college it is the governor’s second marriage he separated from his first wife author helen thorpe in july  after being married for a decade though they didn’t divorce until  the couple have a son teddy  robin hickenlooper said thorpe who attended the new couple’s wedding “has been incredibly welcoming … from the very start” and offered her advice along the way thorpe shunned the role of first lady when the governor took office in january  she remained mostly “elusive” as she put it and avoided the traditional functions that come with the job a week ago robin hickenlooper attended an event with first ladies from other states at the white house where she met michelle obama hickenlooper is reticent to describe her personal politics she described her upbringing in a “liberal environment” only to scold herself “gosh i shouldn’t have used a politically charged word” she said once a registered republican she now is unaffiliated and describes herself as an independent again she declined to elaborate she has donated to republican state treasurer walker stapleton and two other republicans in recent years but otherwise puts her money behind democrats including a  maximum contribution to us sen michael bennet and a  check to clinton in  according to federal and state campaign finance records “i see both sides” she said but she is not entirely comfortable with the political arena “oh my golly it’s so hard for me” she said taking a folksy tone as she did often in the interview “it’s always takes my breath away and stings a little “ hickenlooper said she doesn’t put much thought into her husband’s political future and how it will balance with her career but she said she’s “totally supportive of whatever john wants to achieve in life” the age difference she said is the biggest misunderstanding about their relationship “i think anybody who actually knows me thinks i’m older than he is so it doesn’t actually phase most people once they spend an hour with us because i’m a fairly old soul” she said she considers herself “a friend” to teddy — “i’m not an instant mom” she said — and is not sure whether she will have children of her own “maybe” she said “who knows i really have the attitude i’ve rolled with things my whole life and made the most of what i’ve been given so if god gave us children that would be wonderful my golly i would love to have somebody with john’s blood who was my child and with his personality but also if we didn’t there’s a lot of wonderful things
