global high yield bonds global high yield bonds as a natural extension of our us and european high yield bond strategies oaktrees global high yield bond strategy targets the most attractive riskreturn opportunities we identify across the developed world the strategy seeks to achieve superior riskadjusted returns by investing in the lowerrated yet creditworthy performing bonds of north american and european corporations our global high yield bond portfolios are comanaged by sheldon stone and david rosenberg oaktrees us high yield bond coportfolio managers and james turner oaktree’s european high yield bond portfolio manager and benefit from a highly experienced research team our investment philosophy centers around employing a highly disciplined creditintensive research approach to construct a diversified riskcontrolled portfolio says mr stone we believe the avoidance of defaults is the most reliable source of superior performance allocations between north america and europe are based on an issuebyissue relative value framework and market technicals we do not select investments based on anticipated interest rate movements and resulting price fluctuations since we view these events as beyond our ability to predict with sufficient accuracy in constructing our portfolios we avoid concentrations by industry or company because as we see it thoughtful diversification is one of the most

the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuers ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline the funds may engage in “short sale” transactions of us treasuries where losses may be exaggerated potentially losing more money than the actual cost of the investment and the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms causing a loss to the funds while the funds attempt to limit credit and counterparty exposure the value of an investment in the funds may change quickly and

navigating global bond markets navigating global bond markets    the global bond markets are changing the global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes challenging the traditional role

rates may challenge investors opportunities exist across the globe across the spectrum divergence in global growth lower liquidity may mean higher volatility can your portfolio keep up we believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns  overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds
