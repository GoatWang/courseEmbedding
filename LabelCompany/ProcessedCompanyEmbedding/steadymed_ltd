orphan and other diseases the companys lead candidate consist of trevyentr a development stage drug product which utilizes steadymeds patchpumpr technology to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension steadymed ltd is headquartered in san ramon california full development of patchpump® platform technology  team consulting full development of patchpump® platform technology steadymed ltd specialty pharmaceutical company steadymed ltd came to team to help take their patchpump® wearable injector prefilled with a therapeutic drug from proofofprinciple to an approved drug product that is small discreet waterproof and easy to use conceived as a platform technology patchpump® is designed to be highly customisable and is intended to deliver volumes greater than ml over a period of minutes for bolus delivery or a number of days of continuous infusion depending on the needs of the particular therapy and disease state the first drug device combination product candidate based on the company’s patchpump® platform is known as trevyent® and is being developed to treat patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension pah steadymed’s singleuse trevyent product is designed to accurately and continuously deliver a subcutaneous or intravenous infusion of the drug treprostinil  hours a day every day with each trevyent unit lasting  hours   our approach the project has required us to employ our broad skills in electronics mechanical engineering software design and human factors in order to harness a novel technology and support steadymed through to submission of a new drug application nda to the us fda steadymed’s research team had developed a novel expanding battery the ecell which powers itself to drive a piston against a flexible drug container to administer liquid drug steadymed wanted support and technical leadership from us to turn the technology into an approved manufacturable product according to tight timescales and rigorous regulatory standards as a company in the early stages of development steadymed needed a partner who was flexible cooperative accommodating and used to working with young companies to meet tight timelines and strict budgets it was also critically important to steadymed that their partner possessed expertise and a history of execution in the key disciplines of human factors engineering and design our first job was to look at the architecture and structure of steadymed’s proofofprinciple patchpump® device we proposed a number of refinements in terms of construction sensor type and electronics architecture and confirmed steadymed’s confidence in the technology and initial design we developed an uncomplicated aesthetic form for the device reinforcing its strengths of comfort discretion and ease of use as with many projects of this nature we also managed a number of multinational subcontractors on steadymed’s behalf and worked with the client’s teams in israel and california to evaluate and select the most appropriate manufacturing partners as well as full development we also undertook formative usability testing in the uk and us to better understand the needs of pah sufferers from the outset it was important to ensure that the prefilled preprogrammed trevyent drug product was easy to use we have made the process of drug administration from trevyent very simple offering patients just three steps to operate the project posed several difficult technical challenges many of them related to meeting the tight requirements for delivery accuracy across a range of conditions – including vibration and drop rapid temperature fluctuations and electromagnetic interference with flow rates measuring a few μl per hour accuracy and precision were of paramount importance but still had to be achieved with low cost components suitable for a disposable device a sophisticated closedloop control system was developed providing robust and responsive delivery and rapid detection of infusion line occlusions we have successfully addressed all of these challenges in parallel with the development of the device and working closely with the steadymed team we also developed a series of test methods and test equipment to enable fast and accurate evaluation of the patchpump®’s performance   outcome development stage trevyent units have now been manufactured and working with steadymed we will soon be undertaking stability studies and design verification testing ahead of submission of an nda to the us fda as well as trevyent for pah patients we are developing a patchpump® device based on the same ecell technology that includes integrated and automatic cannula insertion   from our client “we reviewed a number of proposals from toptier product development consultancies for this project and concluded that team had a unique combination of worldclass expertise in design human factors and engineering” “they also excel at the essential ‘softer’ skills such as being supportive accommodating and flexible we had an ambitious vision with this project and our decision to work with team has resulted in a highly effective collaborative effort we couldn’t be happier with the end result”
