edytachristina earned every word of this review she truly is an expert and professional in her field of work edytachristina takes pride in her work she will accept nothing less than a perfect immigration packet to send to immigration officers she will ask you for a lot of pictures documents bills and anything that will assist showing proof of your immigration status or in my case relationship status it will be exhausting finding all these requested documents and other forms of proof it will take quite awhile to gather everything together but i promise it will be worth it edytachristinas expertise truly showed when we first arrived to the uscis office for my wifes parole in place appointment our name was called and my wife was issued her parole in place at the window making her status in the us officially legal we did not have to do an interview or anything extra like other applicants did due to the application edyta christina sent in being perfect our second visit was for my wifes green card we did an interview together with an immigration officer for a total time less than 0 min he truly did not have any questions for us other than confirming information that was in our adjustment of status packet everything he needed was in our packet making it easier on the officer to make his decision he also said your lawyer did a great job with the paperwork a week later my wife received a letter in the mail stating her the decision was made and she was approved for a 0 year green card i will never forget edyta she is truly an amazing person and you can tell she truly cares about her clients thank you edytaimmigration in america  law offices of edytachristina grzybowska grantpeter l ratedi am an irish national who came to the us under the visa waiver program to visit my us citizen partner  we subsequently married and applied to adjust my status to that of a permanent resident we knew nothing of the process beforehand so decided given that we are a gay couple and the recent changes to the law it would be better to use the services of an attorney we searched high and low and spoke to several different attorneys but none impressed us as much as edytachristina grzybowskagrant we decided on retaining her over all the others due to what we first saw as her friendly approachable efficient manner and her excellent knowledge of the law we had a couple of potential complicating factors to our case thank goodness we chose to hire her and trusted our initial thoughts she was the most amazing attorney and successfully helped us get my green card in a very quick timeframe less than  months from application to approval without edyta this process would have been daunting stressful and we would definitely have done something wrong she is so knowledgeable not only about the law but also about uscis systems and processes she saved us from being apart and without her kind and supportive help when we needed it we would have been lost i can not recommend her highly enough and i will definitely suggest to anyone considering using her services to do so you will not find a more compassionate professional organized and knowledgeable attorney

experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship
