more important than that of their client though of course the health of their client can have a direct impact on their own health internal consulting positions can be used to recruit and develop potential senior managers of the organization note corporations need to be conscious of and consistent with how internal consultant costs are accounted for on both a project and organizational level to evaluate cost effectiveness it is likely that the time and materials cost of internal consultants is significantly less than external consultants operating in the same capacity internal relationship provides opportunities to keep certain corporate information private often the internal consultant requires less ramp up time on a project due to familiarity with the corporation and is able to guide a project through to implementation — a step that would often be too costly if an external consultant were used if properly managed and empowered internal consulting groups evaluate
