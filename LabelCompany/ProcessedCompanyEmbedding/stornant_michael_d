turn the call over to blake krueger blake blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc thanks chris good morning everyone and thanks for joining us earlier this morning we reported first quarter revenue of  million and adjusted earnings per share of  both better than we anticipated entering the new year on a constant currency basis adjusted earnings per share grew nearly  over last year very good performance given the continued tepid consumer environment and challenging conditions at retail based on the strong start in our outlook we are raising our adjusted earnings guidance for the year in addition to delivering strong results to start the year we continue to make excellent progress on our enterprise wide strategic transformation initiative the wolverine way forward the most comprehensive transformation effort in our companys long history during the quarter we took steps to better position our portfolio of industryleading brands for the changing marketplace accelerated our store closure program and continued to optimize our global operations platform im also pleased to report that we remain on track to achieve our target of attaining  adjusted operating margin by the end of  our teams hard work over the past year is already yielding meaningful results weve accelerated our efforts to leverage deep consumer insights to amplify our product innovation and compelling storytelling both critical drivers of sustained growth future growth will require agility and deep consumer connections in the face of what we are calling the new normal a global slow to nogrowth environment challenging retail marketplace and shifting consumer expectations despite these continuing realities our goforward strategy is already yielding positive financial results for todays call ill briefly review the performance of our brand groups and provide a more indepth update on the wolverine way forward mike stornant will then provide additional detail on the first quarter financial results and our operational excellence initiatives and well discuss our updated outlook for the remainder of  reviewing our brand groups performance starting with the wolverine outdoor  lifestyle group underlying revenue was up  compared to the prior year with merrell growing low singledigits chaco posting very high single digit growth cat up mid single digits and hush puppies down midteens merrell saw broadbased growth in the quarter growing in the us canada latin america and asia pacific stores and ecommerce also contributed to a solid quarter with ecommerce up over  which helped to offset some headwinds associated with bankruptcies and store closures in the domestic marketplace the new moab  and the natures gym collection both drove growth in the performance outdoor category and the launch of the new merrell work program was very well received at retail we expect these product initiatives to gain additional traction and placement in the coming months the launch of the chameleon  collection one of the brands largest franchises and the new mqm collection featuring pinnacle innovation to enable agile movement in rugged terrain is expected to contribute to the continued momentum in the performance outdoor category in the back half of the year the active lifestyle category continued to be challenging in the first quarter although the rate of decline was significantly lower than the last couple of quarters this category remains an important opportunity and focus for the team going forward the brands product innovation pipeline is as strong as ive ever seen it and im encouraged by merrells start to  moving to the wolverine boston group underlying revenue declined  versus the prior year slightly better than we expected with sperry down lowdouble digits saucony down midsingle digits and keds down midteens as that brand continued to implement its new distribution strategy by selectively reducing pointsofsale and exiting certain distribution in the us marketplace sperry performed better than anticipated entering the quarter with strong growth in own dtc operations especially ecommerce which grew over  although sperry took market share in boat that category remains pressured in the current fashion cycle the sperry team continues to shift product focus and efforts to be less reliant on the boat shoe category sperry boots performed well in q despite market challenges for the boot category overall in the quarter the strong performance of more athletic styles like the crest and the seaside also contributed to the betterthanexpected q revenue results for sperry sperry continues to diversify its product category assortment with more athletic designs vulcanized styles and new collections like  seas which sold then very well in the quarter sperrys boot program has been one of the bright spots in the industry over the last couple of years and the brand will build on this success with the introduction of new mens and womens collection this fall an expanded gold cup collection is also in the works saucony also performed better than expected in q given the impact of bankruptcies and store closures in the broader athletic and sporting goods sector the brands core technical run business was up more than  behind the success of new introductions under the freedom iso and guide franchises both with everun technology this success was offset by softness in the originals category as some international distributors remained focused on reducing their inventory positions in this category although bankruptcies and store closures persisted in the quarter saucony continues to deliver groundbreaking product innovation in both the technical run and at leisure categories looking ahead to the remainder of the year saucony has a robust pipeline of new product introductions in both of these categories in closing with the wolverine heritage group underlying revenue was nearly flat down  compared to the prior year with wolverine up highsingledigits fades down doubledigits the base performance is driven by lower demand in the quarter from the department of defense and delayed timing of contract awards compared to the prior year wolverine drove strong revenue growth across its key categories and channels in both footwear and apparel with the wolverinecom business up nearly  a steady stream of new product introductions in the core work business drove strong q performance ill now take a few moments and provide you with an update on our transformation the wolverine way forward is a holistic enterprisewide business transformation designed to rewire the company to excel in the new normal a fast evolving consumer and global marketplace this transformation is comprised of four critical work streams or what we call our sprint lanes in the past quarter we made great progress in each of these critical lanes and im pleased to share some updates with you our first sprint lane is focused on innovation and growth driving sustained organic growth across the portfolio is the number one priority for the company were intently focused on becoming a designled consumerobsessed growth company and our recent investments in consumer insights and innovation including the opening of our first consumer and innovation hub are providing a real return we are seeing the results of this investment through global trend spotting consumer prelining and ab testing precise marketing mix analysis to assess and improve the effectiveness of our consumer engagement speed initiatives that bring select collections to market in only  of the normal time and our enhanced search digital capabilities and targeted content to drive our ecommerce business we are also in the final stage of launching our first unified consumer database which will allow us to know our consumers better understand how they engage and shop our brand and enable us to drive growth across channels in all  brands im encouraged by the tremendous progress weve made here in a short period of time based on the progress made across the portfolio on our innovation and growth initiatives we expect the company to return to midsingledigit underlying growth in  our second sprint lane is focused on operational excellence we are creating an organization that will be more efficient less complicated and perhaps more importantly faster the significant work the team did over the last  months has us well positioned for  these efforts were reflected in our q results our operational platform which has always been a core strength of the organization is getting stronger and executing with greater speed some of our most important work in the operational excellence area has been our omnichannel realignment plan focused on closing underperforming stores and reinvesting in our fastgrowing highly profitable digital and ecommerce businesses mike will provide a more detailed store closure update in a few minutes weve set up our dtc operations to be significantly more profitable in the future and provide the pinnacle brand experience to our consumers our third sprint lane is portfolio management weve always been active portfolio managers with a sharp focus on our highest value opportunity as you know we recently completed a strategic review of our existing portfolio and have been exploring a variety of alternatives for several of our brands this work is continuing and we expect some announcements in the very near future our business model is fueled by a bestinclass operational platform and a broad global distribution footprint that positions us to successfully integrate new brands and businesses we remain active in assessing the strategic fit of new brands and businesses to our portfolio as our ma activities have historically provided significant profitable growth for the company to this end were pleased to announce the acquisition of the onlineshoescom domain site and consumer database last year onlineshoescom had over  million site visits and has a database of nearly  million consumers we believe leveraging this existing traffic and consumer database will enable us to accelerate growth across our portfolio of brands we will continue to look for new and innovative ways to drive growth consumer connections and ultimately shareholder value by actively managing our portfolio our fourth sprint lane is people and teams it always begins with people i continue to believe that we have not only the best but also the deepest team in the industry over the past year weve added some great new talent and weve realigned some of our key talents to support our most important strategic initiatives and growth opportunity including the wolverine way forward ultimately the team with the best players wins and i believe our team has never been stronger than it is today i couldnt be more pleased with the great progress weve made already this year on our wolverine way forward transformation this work is touching every facet of the company and our associates are embracing the hard work thats underway there is a keen understanding that the company has to change and evolve if we are going to achieve our bold goals of growth and profit improvement in the new normal global consumer marketplace we have a culture of winning and the strategies and tactics under each of our sprint lanes have created a very clear roadmap for our enterprisewide transformation and future success with that ill now turn the call over to mike stornant our senior vice president and chief financial officer who will provide additional commentary on our performance in the quarter as well as provide more details regarding our expectations for the balance of the year mike michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc thanks blake and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today our first quarter financial results were better than expected as the benefits from our operational excellence initiatives in  begin to take hold im very encouraged by the strong start and like blake the incredible progress made on the wolverine way forward transformation the transformation model that we are now deploying will reinforce our focus on the consumer and help provide a new level of pace and urgency for our global teams im excited to share some of the future opportunities and benefits that we can expect from the wolverine way forward but first ill provide a brief review of our q financial results first quarter revenue of  million was better than expected as all brands met or exceeded their revenue plans we were pleased to see good momentum in the quarter from merrell and wolverine in particular underlying revenue declined  and reported revenue declined  compared to the prior year adjusted for an additional week of operations as blake mentioned weve accelerated store closures under the realignment plan that was announced last december since the beginning of the year we have closed  stores and we intend to close  to  more stores by yearend all of our stride rite and trackntrail stores are now closed during q we incurred  million in operating losses related to stores planned to close this year including  million of incremental inventory markdowns related to accelerated store closures losses for these stores will not reoccur in  we have adjusted gross profit and operating profit for the impact of the incremental inventory markdowns adjusted gross margin on a constant currency basis of  was  basis points better than  driven by lower product costs and supply chain efficiencies offset by a change in mix due to fewer retail stores adjusted operating margin on a constant currency basis of  was  basis points better than prior year due to the benefit from actions taken in  including store closures and certain organizational changes q adjusted diluted earnings per share were  and further adjusting for currency were  despite a  decline in underlying revenue we delivered nearly  adjusted constant currency earnings growth compared to last year we incurred  million of discrete costs related to our transformation efforts during q of which  million were noncash these costs were incurred to address underperforming areas of our business and relate to accelerated store closures and the implementation of transformation activities during the quarter including these nonrecurring costs q reported earnings per share were  cash flow from operations improved by  million during the quarter driven by a  decline in inventory our focus on working capital management has been very effective we ended the quarter with  million in cash and cash equivalents up over  versus last year our priorities for cash remain the same drive organic growth return value to shareholders through share repurchases and consistent dividends pay down our debt and pursue potential valueenhancing acquisitions now id like to provide additional insight and detail on the wolverine way forward operational excellence initiatives that are now in progress one of the four sprint lanes that blake discussed earlier during  we dedicated significant effort to drive operational excellence with a focus on speed efficiency and profit improvement specifically we established an internal goal of expanding the companys adjusted operating margin to  by the end of  during the first quarter of  we launched the wolverine way forward and established several operational excellence initiatives to achieve our future operating margin goals while reinvesting to drive growth we are especially focused on a healthier and faster supply chain and omnichannel transformation that addresses underperforming stores and emphasizes our ecom opportunities and an agile operating model that will enable growth our global operation team continues to identify opportunities to reduce product cost and operate at a faster pace we have initiated new work to further reduce suppliers optimize our sku productivity shorten our concepttomarket process and drive further efficiencies the team is also piloting several speed initiatives that will drive down lead times for key programs our accelerated store closure plan is moving forward on schedule with significant progress made since the beginning of the year as a result we will realize  million of operating profit improvement from these closures in  we continue to build a more agile operating model by focusing on indirect spending and our global infrastructure we believe we can harvest meaningful savings here that can be reinvested into future growth opportunities the full benefits from these incremental operational excellence initiatives are still being developed however our current line of sight gives us continued confidence that we will achieve our stated  operating margin goal by the end of  i would like to transition to our revised outlook for the balance of  we remain cautious in our view of the global macroeconomic and retail environment specifically we anticipate global demand for consumer soft goods to remain tepid the us dollar to remain relatively strong negatively impacting product costs in most international markets and the retail environment to remain challenged especially in the us with certain channels facing continued pressure due to the potential for additional bankruptcies as a result we are reaffirming our reported revenue outlook for fiscal  in the range of  billion to  billion essentially flat underlying revenue with  this represents a reported revenue decline in the range of approximately  to  currency and store closures are expected to impact revenue by approximately  million to  million resulting in  underlying revenue to be in the range of down  to up  during q we saw an improvement in adjusted operating margin driven in large part by the benefits from our  operational excellence activities we expect to recognize further improvement in the second half of the year related to these efforts as well as early benefits from the wolverine way forward initiatives we now expect fullyear adjusted operating margin in the range of  to  as a result we have raised our adjusted earnings guidance with full year fiscal  adjusted diluted earnings per share now expected in the range of  to  which includes the negative impact from foreign currency of approximately  per share on a constant currency basis adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of  to  growth of  to  our strategic transformation initiatives are planned throughout  and these efforts are now estimated to include approximately  million of discrete costs of which  million are noncash with over  million for store closures and associated inventory markdowns other related costs include consulting and organizational transformation costs given these adjustments reported earnings per share are expected in the range of  to  the change in our quarterly calendar accelerated store closings and other factors have all impacted the quarterly flow of revenue and earnings for this year so before closing let me provide some additional direction based on the timing of store closures and insights from the phasing of our order book we now expect a fairly consistent flow of revenue by quarter with approximately  of total revenue in the first half and  in the second half of  we expect adjusted operating margin to improve about  basis points versus the prior year in q with progressive improvements in q and q as benefits from the wolverine way forward and transformation are realized for q we now expect earnings per share in the range of  to  the wolverine way forward has created a strong platform for our team as we work to rewire the company to succeed in the new normal our diversified brand portfolio remains strong our biggest brands continue to make excellent progress towards returning to growth with specific emphasis on accelerating our ecom business our operating platforms are stronger than ever and our global network of partners remains one of our key strategic advantages although headwinds persist we like our global competitive position and believe we are poised to accelerate innovation deliver earnings growth generate healthy cash flow and return value to our shareholders thanks for your time this morning we will now turn the call back over to the operator operator questionandanswer session operator yes thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session and the first question comes from edward yruma with keybanc capital markets edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets inc hi good morning guys and thanks for taking my question blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc good morning edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets inc first on the wolverine way forward as you guys dimensionalize this and rewire your business longer term do you think the benefits are going to be driven primarily on the top line or should we see the kind of continued margin improvement that your  cost reduction plans are kind of driving blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc we really think its going to happen in both areas especially shorter term on the bottom line but frankly weve been working hard the last couple of years to create more robust innovation and product pipeline for each of our brands and were starting to see some of the benefits of that already some of the investments we made over the last  months in particular so we think its going to contribute to both top line and bottom line i would also say that our bottom line goal for next year by the end of  to hit a  adjusted operating margin is really not tied to any kind of significant organic growth in  so internally weve tried to separate those concepts although we do believe were going to return to a fairly decent growth in this environment next year weve tried to stay separately focused on our goals there edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets inc got it and one housekeeping question if i may i noticed you guys called out kind of incremental markdowns for some of the store closures and i think you removed that from the nongaap earnings i guess did you also remove the kind of corresponding revenue and as you guided are you also excluding some additional markdowns that are nonstorerelated going forward thank you michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc yeah no we – the revenue from those stores is included in the results we called out the incremental markdowns just the pace of those closures and the finality of certainly the stride rite and trackntrail concepts put us in a position to really have to accelerate some of the inventory liquidation there unusual i guess based on our normal cadence of store closures so we adjusted out just the inventory markdown impact in q well have a similar impact in q and then that will be behind us but its a relatively small amount compared to the amount of inventory that we were able to liquidate through the process edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets inc great thanks so much blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc great thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from jim duffy with stifel jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks good morning guys blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc good morning jim michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc hi jim jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc two questions for me first the  stores thats a lot of stores to close yeartodate is that ahead of pace relative to your expectations or is that in line with what you have anticipated as you entered the year michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc well we called out back in february that we had line of sight to close about  stores so you can imagine the work and the effort on negotiating the additional stores the team did an amazing job to kind of line that up and even though we had intentions to get through the store fleets at the level we did we certainly didnt have line of sight to that in february so the  stores certainly were closed on an accelerated basis and as i mentioned we have about  or  that are going to continue to run out through the balance of the year some of them on normal lease expirations and some will close at yearend but that was about twice as many as weve kind of guided to at the beginning of the year jim jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay that leaves me my next question whats the impact of revenue from accelerating those store closures is there some consequence from that thats contemplated in your guidance and where do you see yourself making that up elsewhere michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc yeah i mean we had a range in our guidance for that i think fundamentally theres a small amount of revenue that by pulling some of those closures ahead id say its probably  million to  million at the most related to the accelerated stores that we didnt necessarily anticipate in our revenue guidance but not fundamentally different some puts and takes in the revenue overall including some upside in the latter part of the year from our international business but fairly small so really not a big impact on the revenue side jim jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and then mike a stepup in the onetime charges implied in the spread between the gaap and nongaap guidance more than  million can you put some shape around that please michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc sure yeah first its really related to our ability to get clarity around the additional store closures so starting the year we had  in the estimate for nongaap costs about  store closures that we had line of sight to obviously now thats closer to  stores so a big increase there as we were able to negotiate through the closing process with landlord and then we finalized our transformation initiatives in the middle to latter part of q which included setting up our own transformation office weve got a professional consulting firm onboard now to support our efforts here to accelerate the benefits around the wolverine way forward those were all in process when we provided our early guidance there so those are the two big changes all discrete costs all costs that we expect to incur this year that wont recur obviously next year but really important for us to achieve the accelerated benefits that we want to get into  from all these key initiatives jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and then my last question i think you mentioned that  million of the charges are noncash michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc right jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc whats the outlook for free cash flow inclusive of the impact of all the cashrelated charges michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc yeah were – our free cash flow this year will be obviously a bit lower than last year because of the  million result from these charges but our free cash flow delivering about  million to  million range for the year jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thanks for that guys operator thank you and the next question comes from jay sole with morgan stanley jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks so much blake you kind of gave us a lot of great detail on the four lanes can you talk to us about just the path to get from the ish range that youre at at operating margin right now to  what are the main buckets and like what – how many basis points from each bucket will contribute to getting to  michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc yeah its pretty – this is mike ill take that question its pretty consistent with what we kind of laid out in our original guidance i mean when we look at the path from  to  and the  run rate that we expect coming out at  its really going to come out of the same categories supply chain continues to be an ongoing opportunity for us and even though weve made amazing progress so far this year the team is even more focused there i think the opportunities now go beyond the normal activities and really focus on engineering and developing a more nimble supply chain with a focus on sku management and some other things we think about half of the overall benefit in  will still come from the supply chain we only got about half of the benefit from our store closures in  so another  million is going to come from that improvement in  and then we continue to look at the organizations some of the indirect spending areas that we can be leaner and meaner on it really comes from a variety of areas there but obviously supply chain and store closures are the big drivers and then the other thing that i would say its really important to appreciate the magnitude and the breadth of the way forward initiatives i mean it really – its touching every part of our business all global campuses and so the effort here by the team on the first quarter or so of activity has been pretty amazing to really uncover additional opportunities we dont expect to take all of these savings to the bottom line and we have a pretty robust plan to reinvest what weve been able to harvest so far and what we will harvest as we move into  and were still developing all that so well be able to give more clarity on that in the future okay but right now we have a pretty high level of confidence as were starting to see this materialize jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc got it and then – thats super helpful now on inventory you talked about how sales were impacted by store closures and you kind of gave an adjusted sales number and an underlying sales growth rate on inventory how much of the decline in inventory is just being impacted by the store closures and how much of it is just clearing through aged goods if you could give us a sense of like what the growth in inventory would look like on a normalized basis and then given the extra store closures that will be happening over the rest of the year how you see inventory growth trending as we go through q and into q and q that would be super helpful michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc its a good question so at the end of the year we were in a high decrease in inventory than at the end of q and we were down again  its really coming from sort of both channels our stores obviously having a positive impact to closure stores a positive impact on inventory but all of our wholesale businesses are also seeing a similar decline i will say that weve taken advantage of some of the store closures to move some aged inventory out of our wholesale warehouse but ultimately were seeing that kind of discipline and improvement really across the business and as we continue to drive sku productivity going forward we expect to be able to be even – be able to drive inventories down even further by the end of the year jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks so much operator thank you and our next question comes from chris svezia with wedbush christopher svezia  wedbush securities inc yeah hi good morning everyone blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc good morning christopher svezia  wedbush securities inc i guess the first question i have is just on the – im trying to sort of understand something with regard to the inventory and what is in the first quarter numbers in terms of store closures i guess specifically blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc sure christopher svezia  wedbush securities inc so of the  million that i think youre taking out of nongaap numbers is that just related to more aggressive inventory reductions that you took or does that also take into effect the over  stride rite stores that you actually closed michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc its all related to the stores that are already closed now and its really the kind of accelerated timing of doing that and having to kind of clear out the store inventory at a faster pace we just didnt have the normal cadence to our store closure strategy this year and so we had to take some additional markdowns but thats all related to stores that were in closing mode during the first quarter christopher svezia  wedbush securities inc okay so its not in addition to something you did more aggressively its just in aggregate all those stores closing michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc yeah christopher svezia  wedbush securities inc  million was related to the inventory okay michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc and that would be above what we would normally incur in a kind of normal closure cadence christopher svezia  wedbush securities inc okay switch gears for a second saucony i think in the past you had talked about saucony potentially growing for this year i know you dont talk about brands specifically but i think you alluded to the fact that you expected it to grow is that still the plan despite how q unfolded blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yes we currently plan for saucony to grow this year i would say virtually all of the q decline was directly related to the bankruptcies we all know about in the athletic and sporting goods sectors for saucony those – that string of bankruptcies probably had the biggest impact of all of our brands on saucony and then after saucony probably merrell so when we look at the saucony product innovation pipeline we anticipate some pretty good performance of the remainder of the year michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc they were ahead – chris they were ahead of plan in the quarter we were just comping up against a good quarter last year before those bankruptcies really took effect so the run rate for the rest of the year is certainly on schedule and were comfortable that saucony is in a strong position christopher svezia  wedbush securities inc okay and then blake you made some comment earlier about midsingledigit growth potentially organically as we think about  im sure that does take into consideration any residual impact from store closures but what – looking – given the environment looking that far forward what would give you the level of confidence to make that observation what are either some of the just primary or basic sort of drivers thought process changes in channels in distribution whatever the case might be that kind of gives you that comfort level blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah i would say a couple of things first of all the last  months couple of years we put a lot of work in behind the seam on our product pipelines for our various brands so we have pretty good insight into what is coming down the road for merrell for sperry for saucony and certainly all of our largest brands so that gives us a great deal of confidence especially the takeup on the new product introductions in q of last year and q of this year i think the other thing that gives us some confidence is about half of our pairs are sold offshore so last year was an interesting year last year was the year when our international business held serve i would put it in that context and we kind of anticipate that again this year as we travel the world and talk to all of our international distributors most of whom will be in here in just a week for our international sales conference a lot of their countries are doing okay i would say today the weakest country and channel around the world probably is the us wholesale channel in consumer soft goods in general not just in footwear so we think our balance of domestic and international business puts us in a pretty good position and we still have of – despite our broad geographic reach we still have plenty of opportunities around the world christopher svezia  wedbush securities inc okay thank you and final thing here just real quick just mike for you things like the tax rate for the year being in the high s interest and other being in the  to  million and i think share count  to  million shares will still hold is that correct michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc theyll hold yeah thats correct christopher svezia  wedbush securities inc okay all right thanks very much guys michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc okay thanks chris operator thank you and the next question comes from corinna van der ghinst from citi research corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc hi good morning thank you mike your comments on cadence for this year were really helpful thank you for sharing that can you guys give us a sense of what your order book currently looks like for fall and how youre expecting sperry boot penetration to compare to last year blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah i mean we really dont give that metric any more in any great detail i guess i can say that our order book has been improving gradually over the last three or – a couple quarters so theres been a steady – theres still a lot of volatility retailers are playing it close to the vest the see now buy now not only applies to consumers it also applies to retailers and weve had a couple of warm winters in a row so – and we all know that the us is over stored and so retailers are being conservative but weve seen a gradual improvement in our order book over the last couple of quarters corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc okay great and then just aside from the fiscal calendar change are you guys planning to make any shifts in the timing of your orders your shipments for this year michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc yeah i think there are – i mean again as our international business begins to ramp up thats always going to be a stronger q kind of a position for the international team and we are seeing some of that in the order book but i think overall the pace of delivery of some of the new introductions for sperry boots and even for merrell as they kind of leverage their arctic grip programs thats going to be late q early q so not a lot of changes in terms of that obviously we have more frequent introductions of new product coming out of both of our big brands i think that fundamentally may change just the timing of some of the shipments into the marketplace as we bring new programs and not unlike the new merrell work a tactical product that started to hit late q so therell be some timing shifts for things like that but fundamentally things are fairly stable corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc okay great thats helpful and then you mentioned that you expect some of your merrell launches to continue gaining traction over the next few quarters which i think is pretty consistent with your previous statements that some of the growth would be somewhat backhalf weighted so i was just wondering does your guidance also assume an acceleration from this low singledigit rate that we saw in q for the merrell brand is that into your numbers right now blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yes its all included in our estimates for the year we expect merrell to grow this year probably right now a midsingledigit growth underlying growth in  and its a pretty robust product pipeline not just the work in tactical and – but in the moab  and natures gym collections which were introduced in q but you look at the new chameleon  and a much expanded arctic grip line the siren collections for women and the mgm collection so merrell has a very robust product pipeline that will keep flowing from now through the end of the year corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc okay thank you so much blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from erinn murphy with piper jaffray erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co great thanks good morning blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc good morning erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co i guess blake you talked about the us environment being the most challenging right now could you just talk a little bit more about how the channel looks from an inventory perspective you go into the back half of the year and just maybe boots versus nonboot product blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah i think frankly when i compare the wholesale channel in the us to last year its in a much better position when it comes to inventory so inventories retailers kind of conservative erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co and youre speaking broadly blake broadly blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yes i erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co youre not just speaking about your business okay blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc correct im speaking broadly when i say that so thats encouraging the entire industry is really not in the same position it was last year when it comes to inventory we know the consumer is still out there the consumer hasnt totally quit shopping the consumer is looking for something fresh and innovative and is using some different – continues to use some different channels as well our mobile traffic in the quarter was again up over  so you really have to be in that digital social mobile space in todays environment so we feel pretty good about inventory positions overall and especially the inventory positions for our brands domestically erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay and then just in the us market i mean i know you guys probably didnt change your full year guidance from a sales perspective are you making any assumptions that there could be potential further bankruptcies for the sporting goods channels or other maybe independent channel that you fell into blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah we dont erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co or youre moving at status quo blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah we dont really see that changing i guess thats just part of the new normal right now we dont see that environment changing in the short term so we think therell be some continued retailers that are challenged therell be some additional bankruptcies one estimate on store closures that i read last week now predict at least at this run rates store closures this year in the us to equal  and  combined thats a little bit of a startling fact now thats all retail thats not just consumer soft goods or footwear thats all retail but clearly the us remains in an overstored position given the changing consumer and we as a company tried to adjust to that with accelerated store closures in q so we tried to take our medicine as quickly as we could possibly take it because we just thought that was the smart thing to do erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay well i guess im just a little confused just in the guidance though when you think about just kind of not changing your sales guidance are you assuming now versus where you were three months ago that there are more bankruptcies that will impact your business directly or – im just trying to make sure if there are certain accounts that you fell into that youre more worried about that youve effectively risked the guidance for or are you just kind of assuming what you thought last year with sports authority and some of the other businesses that kind of had some derivative impacts on your kind of sales or core brands like a merrell that that just flow through im just trying to understand whats in or not in the guidance at this point michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc erinn i think our visibility to all that was – and our level of conservatism was really built into our original revenue guidance back in february erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc so we still feel the same way we still feel theres risk out there and there are some concern with certain channels and certain retailers keeping a very close eye in all that but i think we had an early read on that and already factored it into our guidance erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co got it and then just – i know you changed your president for sperry in the last i think three to four months can you just talk about kind of any impacts on the product that we should see over the next  to  months when will they have an impact on the business what we have to look forward to there just given where the trends are today blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah tom kennedy had been with us for a little less than a year and a half before we made the move on sperry i would say hes a very quick mover clearly anchored in the fashion world and hes already in just the last couple of months focused sperry – which has an excellent product team by the way – but focused them on a wide range of opportunities in adjacent categories casual shoes athletic shoes and pretty much like the move weve seen over the last couple of years where sperry moved into boots and so were going to see some very fast expansion into these other categories for sperry the great news there is from the consumer and the retailers no impediment with respect to the sperry brand whatsoever they want the sperry brand to be a big business for them so were really excited about that change erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay and then just with merrell any update on the president there i think thats been a big deal right now blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah we brought – yeah as you know we brought todd spaletto on board two and a half months ago and we kind of put that on pause to get erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc todd into the business and to continue that search we should certainly be in a position to make an announcement before next quarterly call erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co got it and so will he be – hes effectively looking for someone to work alongside with him for that brand specifically blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc correct yes erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay got it blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc were working together on that important position erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay thanks blake operator thank you operator instruction and the next question comes from jonathan komp with robert w baird jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc yeah hi thank you a bigger picture question just on the guidance for the year i think the press release theres a mention of the strong q results plus improving business conditions and i just wanted to ask is that entirely focused on the cost initiatives and the timing of some of the savings from the internal actions or are you seeing some underlying improvement in the end markets for any of your brands michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc no i think a lot of it has to do with the things that we have executed on and can deliver but also as blake mentioned i think overall our inventories and our customer inventory positions are in a better shape and so what were seeing and i think moab  is a good example where the channel is a little bit cleaner and we can flow goods in at a more normal basis and i think that is – were not seeing that everywhere but thats a good example of where were starting to see a little bit better kind of environment for some of our brands and some opportunities so – but fundamentally jon i think the pace and the timing of the benefits that are coming to fruition through way forward and some of the work we did last year is probably the biggest driver for blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc the bottomline michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc our bottomline guidance raise jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc okay great and then when you look at the year at the underlying revenue embedded in the guidance close to flat with the range on both sides and you started the first quarter down  so i know some of this was asked about already but any more detail on the key drivers of the progression you see as the year progresses blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc no i think its pretty straightforward jon i think it really related to the product flow from our bigger brands coming into the market so weve got pretty good line of sight to that and both product pipelines are getting more robust every season and its just simply a question of the timing of the new product introductions jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc okay and last one for me and this might be getting too detailed relative to your internal goal to get to a midsingle digit topline trajectory im just wondering is that something youre thinking about for all of  or in other words as you exit  and into early  do you see a pathway to getting to that type of growth on that timeline or blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah i think its something were thinking of for all of  i know thats a few quarters out right now but again weve got pretty good line of sight to our product pipelines for our more significant brands and we feel very good about the innovation and the focus on the consumer and the market intelligence that we have for this growth around the world jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc okay thank you michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc thanks jon operator thank you and the next question comes from mitch kummetz with b riley mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc yeah thanks for taking my questions i apologize i got on the call late so forgive me if youve already addressed this but im curious as far as q revenues what was the beat relative to plan you guys obviously crushed the consensus number but mike if i recall it correctly youve kind of indicated that the additional week would have been about  million kind of across the first three quarters and obviously you guys were reporting that the impact was actually  million so im just kind of curious how much better did you guys actually come into plan and what was the main driver there michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc well i mean the important – i think the important outcome we had over performance from just about everybody our stores – yeah i will say just the acceleration of some of the store closures added a little bit of additional revenue that we werent anticipating because we were able to get into that closing mode a little faster and we obviously accelerated the liquidation of inventory there that was a small impact i mean merrell was a big driver sperry certainly over delivered it really was across the portfolio so – and typically we obviously monitor the sort of the timing of pullaheads and things like that there were really not any major intentional pullaheads or anything like that that had any major impact on revenue in the quarter it was just good performance mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc got it okay and then secondly blake you already talked about this you said the channel inventory is looking a lot better than a year ago you guys obviously arent giving us kind of what the order book is but i think your comments also suggest that even though theres been sequential improvement that retailers are still being pretty cautious in terms of how theyre writing orders so im just curious like whats the reorder assumption kind of in – well particularly in the fourth quarter it would seem that with channel inventories clean and retailers cautious on orders that that could set up for a good fourth quarter in terms of reorders and im just wondering kind of how youre thinking about that sort of whats the assumption thats embedded in the guidance and i guess as a followup to that i think historically youve talked about kind of reorders or atonce to prebooks being sort of a  split and actually maybe leaning a little more towards reorders in the fourth quarter is that still about accurate blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah i mean on the first part of your question in our guidance we have not really planned on anything out of the ordinary when it comes to atonce orders mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc okay blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc logic would tell us that maybe we can expect some improvement here in this fall given the inventory position of retailers but we havent really factored anything material into our guidance in that regard michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc right and in the fourth quarter it really is a pretty good blend of futures and atonce but again the future orders for international business are pretty heavy in q so probably a little more weighted to future orders mitch than atonce mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc got it michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc but to blakes point weve seen pretty sporadic activity in our atonce trends generally its been a little bit better but weve seen some weeks that are great and some weeks that are not great its pretty indicative i think of the retail channel especially in the us where when theres an open to buy opportunity and retailers are placing reorders and when they have to scale back they just dont so its still not back to normal times and were being mindful of that in our guidance mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc got it all right thank you blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc thanks mitch operator thank you operator instruction and the last question comes from scott krasik with buckingham research scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc hey guys thanks for fitting me in here just a few fast ones so can you say how big or what was the merrell work launch this quarter blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc i mean yeah merrell launched work this quarter very good position of that product at retail in the context of the overall merrell business i would say a good launch but not certainly anything unusually significant so merrell is taking a very focused approach here a very restrictive approach on which retailers its going to and what channel for distribution focusing a lot on our own ecommerce site scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc it also didnt get launched until late in the quarter so it didnt have a huge impact on q scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay thank you and then on – did you say youre buying shoescom or onlineshoescom blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc onlineshoescom shoescom in a related bankruptcy proceeding and this – we had in canada and the us that was bought by walmart just the domain site and we ended up buying the domain site of onlineshoescom plus the complete database scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay is that blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc i might just add for an amount significantly less than what walmart paid for shoescom scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc is that an operating site are there sales or no blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah not right now michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc not yet blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc but its the database we were most interested in as well as the domain site itself but its the database of consumers scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay and then just one thing off of chriss question so early look at  to grow revenues midsingle digits but you kind of achieve a  operating margin on flat rev so if you do grow revenues in  organically does that mean that theres upside to that  blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah if that occurs we would anticipate upside scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay all right thanks very much and good luck blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc thanks operator thank you and we have time for one more question and that comes from laurent vasilescu from macquarie laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc good morning and thanks for taking my question i wanted to follow up on gross margins i think the last quarter it was outlined that store closures will lead to  bps headwind for the fullyear gross margins can you tell us how much the impact was for the first quarter and are you still comfortable with the  bps headwind guide blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah in the first quarter it was probably in a similar range right in that range obviously more because of the closure from the previous year and thats what were really talking about is the – at the gross margin level obviously without the benefit of the stores we lose leverage there but so the similar impact in q and thats about what we would expect for the full year as we work through the rest of our stores that were closing and anniversary the store closures from  laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc okay great and then i think in the remarks it was called out that there are some product cost headwinds maybe related to fx how should we think about the underlying gross margin the first half versus the second half of  if product cost inflation becomes a headwind blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc well we arent seeing any product cost headwinds right now impact the work that were doing really its helped us mitigate any of those and actually improve product cost the fx impact for the year that can have about a  basis point impact on margin and thats pretty consistent thats what we experienced in q and you see that being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc okay very helpful and then a question on stride rite and i want to follow up on that on the wholesale business i think in the february call it was called out that the wholesale business was roughly half of what the stride rite retail business with the stride rite blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc  laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc yeah with stride rite now the store is actually closed how should we think about the wholesale business for this year michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc i mean theyll continue to operate on that same level i dont – we see some progress – obviously that stride rite business includes all of our takedown brands as well so we have the stride rite brand and then we have our adult brands that are part of that its about a  mix of both our wholesale business – actually the stride rite wholesale did well in the first quarter beat their plan in revenue and earnings we expect the business to continue forward laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc okay thank you and then lastly on saucony just on that midsingledigit decline can you parse out how much the us did yearoveryear in terms of growth or decline blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc yeah i dont have those figures right in front of me but i think the us was basically flat maybe down very lowsingle digits with respect to footwear in q laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc okay thank you very much and best of luck blake w krueger  wolverine world wide inc thanks michael d stornant  wolverine world wide inc thanks laurent operator and that does conclude the questionandanswer session i would like to return the call to
