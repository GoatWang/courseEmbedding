years at the tuskegee institute in alabama for six years at wilberforce university in ohio and since  at howard university then the most prestigious african american university in the country at howard he also held the post of dean of the college of arts and sciences though he excelled and was hugely popular as an academic administrator woodard was also an intellectual in the early s he began taking advanced mathematics courses in the summer sessions at columbia university it then became clear that he was among the gifted mathematicians in the nation columbias loss was penns gain when in  woodard took scholarly leave from howard and spent a year at penn working under the direction of john r kline one of the best and brightest of penns mathematics faculty on wednesday  june  woodard became the th person to receive a phd in mathematics from penn more significantly woodard was only the second african american in the nation to receive that degree dr woodard returned to howard where

enrolled at penn in the  academic year won a harrison scholarship in mathematics in his second year and took the most prestigious award offered at penn at that time a harrison fellowship in mathematics in his third and final year of graduate studies claytors dissertation delighted the penn faculty for it provided a significant advance in the theory of peano continua  a branch of pointset topology in which kline was an expert on wednesday  june  penn conferred its phd on claytor who thereby became the third african american in the nation to earn the degree in mathematics when claytor published his dissertation he had every reason to expect competing offers from americas leading research universities but in that era of pervasive racial discrimination only a predominantly african american institution west virginia state college welcomed him to its faculty in  dr claytor published his embedding theorem which stated a peano continuum k is homeomorphic to a subset of the surface of a sphere if and only if it contains neither a primitive skew curve nor a topological image of either of the figures  or  see illustration at the top of this page proceedings of the eleventh annual meeting of the national association of mathematicians  photograph courtesy of the national association of mathematicians the polish mathematician casmir kuratowski had introduced figures  and  but claytor advanced the theory and incorporated it into an effective whole professional mathematicians began to refer to these figures as claytor curves john r kline continued to mentor claytor and on his recommendation claytor obtained a rosenwald fellowship in  he spent a year at the university of michigan working with professor rl wilder and a group of talented topologists claytor developed further his theory on imbeddability working with wilder on questions concerning homogeneous continua despite the support of his colleagues michigan failed to offer him a faculty position friends intervened and opened the possibility of a position at the institute for advanced study in princeton but something had changed within him and he declined the offer after service in the united states army during world war ii claytor renewed his teaching but ceased his research in  a year after woodards retirement claytor joined the howard university faculty where he remained until taking early

opportunity to partner in the celebration of its centennial we also wish to thank professor jerry porter who conceived the woodard  claytor exhibition and whose determination played a large part in bringing it to fruition professor bob engs played a huge role in our success by recruiting rahsaan maxwell from the department of history and we are delighted that professor howard stevenson the fellows and dean at dubois college house will be providing the exhibition a permanent home in the dubois college house library prior to this exhibition the extraordinary achievements of dudley woodard and william claytor were virtually unknown at penn eighteen years ago also under the auspices of the university archives extensive research established the names and biographies of the first african american alumni at each of penns twelve schools no corresponding effort however has expanded our knowledge to include the first african american graduates of the two dozen distinct academic disciplines in the school of arts and sciences perhaps this exhibition will serve to encourage such additional research surely it answers any questions concerning the distinguished presence of african americans in the history of mathematics at penn the success of the research writing and illustration of the exhibition is largely due to the research strategy which mark lloyd and rahsaan maxwell developed early last summer utilizing published sources at penn and through interlibrary loan rahsaan prepared for two visits to howard university and one to morgan state university the institutions of higher education where woodard and claytor spent their professional careers on site in the district of columbia and baltimore respectively rahsaan interviewed former colleagues of both men and obtained copies of primary source materials found in the university archives at both institutions over a period of six weeks he steadily assembled detailed and reliable biographical accounts by early august he had prepared draft text and submitted it to the mathematics faculty editing particularly of the technical phrases in the text was completed rapidly the exhibit materials were soon placed in the hands of the fabricators who installed them in the display case in early september by the time it is removed next month for delivery to dubois college house the exhibit will have enjoyed a full
