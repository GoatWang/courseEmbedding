do this for longterm success according to sir martin sorrell eunice yoon  saheli roy choudhury sunday  mar    pm etcnbccom shares show chapters the rise of the chinese multinational    sunday  mar    pm et   chinese multinational companies in search of global domination should probably build their business around specific product groups instead of trying to diversify into too many verticals said sir martin sorrell the ceo of wpp group speaking to cnbcs squawk box at the sidelines of the china development forum sorrell said companies that focus on developing their products tend to be more successful in the longer term i think focused strategies around very strict product groups are the way to go not the diversified conglomerate strategy which seems to be driven more by trying to diversify assets outside of china and obviously invest abroad he said sorrell added that chinese companies should first attempt to conquer chinas vast domestic market before looking to expand abroad so exhaust all the opportunities in china first then you have to start looking at whether you go for the bigger markets obviously like the us or western europe or you start to pick up some of the smaller markets that are contiguous to china in the context of asia pacific particularly given the belt and road strategy he said on monday wpp and kantar millward brown released a study that examined the top  most valuable chinese brands where technology banks and telecom providers led category brand value contribution in the country tencent remains chinas most valuable brand and among other recognizable technology names alibaba came second baidu fifth and huawei sixth many chinese brands are now becoming internationally recognizable due to their presence outside the mainland according to the wpp ceo a lot of chinese companies now are expanding abroad said sorrell huawei is a very strong example of that lenovo is another these are all companies that are building businesses abroad and you see two different strategies — one a very diversified strategy like a fosun or a wanda which probably is lacking a bit of focus the second was the very focused strategies like that of huawei zte and others that are building strong brands both domestically and abroad he added neil hall  wpa pool  getty images the study found the standout performers were brands operating in products and services that are catered for the urban middle class as china pivots to a more consumptionled economy education and travel agencies were the fastestgrowing sectors while technology and retail sectors remained strong according to the study sorrell said this years study showed the rise of the chinese multinationals in fact this year for the first time in our survey of the  top brands here in china i think the fifth time weve done it  weve seen chinese brands eclipse some of the foreign mncs he said adding the real competition that foreign mncs now face come from companies in china india vietnam

 edt last modified on monday  june   edt for more than three decades sir martin sorrell has run wpp – the worldleading advertising group he built from scratch out of a small maker of wire baskets – with an iron grip since jacking in his job as finance chief at saatchi  saatchi to start his own business at the very undotcom age of  sorrell has built wire  plastic products – the shell company he used as his vehicle for global domination and which still makes metalware to this day – into a business with a stock market valuation of £bn investors have been rewarded handsomely £ invested at wpp’s inception in  would be worth £ today sorrell has been rewarded too two years ago he took home more than £m one of the biggest pay deals in uk corporate history and over the last five years has pocketed £m for years investors were placated by wpp’s relentless growth and questions about the control exerted by its founder were put to one side “like domino’s wpp continues to deliver” said the company’s former chairman philip lader once using fast food as an attempt to justify sorrell’s proprietorial management style and ballooning pay the chief executive’s big paydays have been seen as symptomatic of what critics call “sorrellcentricity” at wpp – the view that sorrell is autocratic and dominates decisionmaking – which in turn has led investors to increasingly challenge the governance of the company “sir martin identifies very closely with wpp as his personal creation” says sarah wilson chief executive of shareholder advisory service manifest “the cult of the superstar chief executive does not create a healthy corporate culture they’re increasingly the only person we associate with the organisation its successes or failures and in fact with any of its business decisions at all” a change in attitude to corporate pay from the public and investors – and more recently theresa may’s warning that she would curb boardroom excess – has started to loosen sorrell’s once unquestioned control a series of investor rebellions against his pay the biggest being in  during the “shareholder spring” when  of investors rejected his annual pay package has forced wpp’s board to cut his remuneration dramatically last week wpp revealed sorrell was paid £m in  the last year of the controversial “leap” incentive scheme it has been forced to scrap a new policy capping his annual pay at about £m had already been agreed but continued unrest among shareholders led the company to announce it would reduce pay further to a maximum of just over £m this would put him much more in line with his peers john wren the longserving chief executive of the world’s secondbiggest ad group omnicom was paid m last year michael roth chief executive of rival ipg was paid m however the £m cap won’t come in until  when sorrell is  this raises the spectre of what wpp has called the “succession elephant” which has now superseded pay as the no  issue facing the company and its founder facebook twitter pinterest maurice lévy of publicis left and john wren of omnicom photograph bertrand langloisafpgetty images “discussions with wpp have been partly about pay the quantum and also very much about succession” says one major investor in wpp who does not wish to be named “partly the reason sorrell’s pay has been so large is that the company has done very well but he also got away with negotiating big pay packages because of the whole unanswered issue of succession” roberto quarta who is a year into his job as wpp’s new chairman said last week that succession planning had become “even more focused and detailed over the last year” he explained there was an “exceptional team of potential candidates” from wpp’s top management as well as a “constantly refined list of external candidates” claire enders of research firm enders analysis said the perception of sorrell’s domination is a fallacy “martin has a thousand great people across the world in the first tier” she says “year in year out the company makes wpp a systemic largescale success rather than the daily product of one man spinning” at  even with a new baby to deal with sorrell’s health and indefatigable work ethic seem to make the issue of age irrelevant indeed gerontocracies are common in medialand rupert murdoch is  barry diller is  as is sorrell’s erstwhile adversary maurice lévy who this summer will step down as chief executive of publicis the world’s thirdlargest advertising company ipg’s roth is  while omnicom’s wren is the sprightliest of the bunch at  nevertheless a new generation is on the horizon lévy’s successor arthur sadoun is just  for example one quirk of sorrell’s relationship with wpp is in his contract instead of the standard notice period of  months it says he can terminate his service – or that the company can – “at will” sorrell may only own a few per cent of the company he founded – his stake and that of his family trust is currently worth £m – but the idea of retirement couldn’t be further from his mind “only when they shoot me” he has said topics wpp the observer sir martin sorrell wpp media executive pay and bonuses advertising features share on

published on saturday  july   edt when sir martin sorrell got himself a puppy a red setter he named it savage as our car crawls through central london from wpps mayfair head office to millbank where sorrell is to sit on a panel the dog sits placidly in the back lolling its head in the sun the name couldnt seem less apt when sorrell gets out he offers a firm handshake and urges me to be nice to the mutt i called him savage because he isnt he says the comment is left hanging in the air asking to be grasped as a metaphor for sorrell himself who comes with a formidable reputation but in the space of the previous hour squeezed between meetings is charm itself he laughs at being called a beancounter and an outsider in the advertising world he bemoans being stereotyped as a north london jew he makes repeated slightly awkward jokes about his short stature and later sends an email apologising again for turning up late it is easy to be drawn in but for all the easy manner and selfdeprecation sorrell has proven time and again that unlike savage he has considerable bite it is  years since sorrell took a loan out against his shares in saatchi  saatchi where he had been finance director and bought a small company called wire and plastic products which made wire baskets and which he would build into the largest advertising and marketing services group in the world he has amassed so many companies that he has lost count got no idea but it is a lot it is a lot some of the larger ones have included the advertising networks j walter thompson ogilvy  mather grey and young  rubicam the public relations firms hill  knowlton and bursonmarsteller and a growing number of digital businesses revenues last year reached £bn and the group employs  people its bigname clients include ford bp vodafone and unilever along the way he has engaged in some bitterly contested hostile takeovers including jwt and research business taylor nelson sofres tns making it clear that he is not above putting the odd nose out of joint david ogilvy famously called sorrell an odious little jerk although he later had a change of heart took a job at wpp and became lavish in his praise chris ingram former boss of mediabuying group tempus once said he would rather lick an abattoir floor than work for sorrell weve done what are euphemistically called hostile situations sorrell says it is very interesting was it jimmy goldsmith the late financier who said there is no such thing as a hostile takeover there isnt really it is hostile to one person the chief executive of the target company it is not hostile to the share owners it is not hostile to the clients it is not hostile to the people who work there so it becomes more personal in that sense sorrell perhaps got some of his ruthless streak from the saatchis who when he worked there broke the gentlemens agreement in the industry that agencies did not go after each others client bases he says it was also where he honed his takeover skills when he assumed control of wpp the only way to grow quickly was through acquisitions he set about building a portfolio of belowtheline businesses in less glamorous industries such as direct marketing and sales promotion unloved and therefore cheap he had no clear idea how big the firm would become he says but knew he wanted to do something of size i didnt want forgive the phrase a mickey mouse kind of thing i wanted to do something of scale putting it grandly from an intellectual point of view i thought it interesting he puts the decision to strike out on his own down to the andropause the male menopause after reaching  the advertising industry at the time he says was very boys clubby it was also highly fragmented and consequently didnt reflect the growing global outlook and reach of its clients making it ripe for consolidation plus there were very few barriers to entry he says i mean you needed a desk and a phone you could go into a hotel and start an agency from a room which you see in mad men the deal that announced he had arrived was the m takeover of jwt in  the funniest thing about it was we were in this tiny sort of subbasement rather like rats underground bidding for a company  times our size it was quite amusing the hostile takeover of om for m two years later almost bankrupted the business he says he rarely sees the saatchis any more although he sometimes runs into charles in mayfair restaurants sorrell has become one of the best known businessmen in britain but has never been able to shake off his own industrys view that he is something of an interloper the harvardtrained financier who ran roughshod over advertising outsider i think i am an outsider he says i think when we did our first highprofile deal which was jwt i was definitely the outsider the picture on ad age had me in shirt sleeves with a plastic coffee cup and a pen and that was it the man who would be king was the headline i always remember that very funny a cod psychologist might think his outsider status had driven his desire to emerge as the most powerful figure in the industry his nose pressed against the windows of advertisings charlotte street establishment well a psychologist could say i have a napoleonic complex because of my size i am exactly the same size as napoleon as i have pointed out and people have criticised me for saying it five foot six and a half which you know french metrics it is five foot four and a half their feet are  inches or something it is the third joke he has made about his size in a matter of  minutes well everybody likes to make it so i like to sort of do it first he says people say i am an only kid a spoilt only boy from a middleclass family i do find it intensely irritating that they always say jewish northwest london background – they dont often say catholic northeast background or whatever there have been books written about why people do things and dont do things and they point to things like i am second generation my grandparents came from russia in  you can go through it all … i think i had a pushy mother a pushy jewish mother he laughs who used to wrap everything in plastic rich rewards the business has made sorrell enormously wealthy – he has banked tens of millions from incentive schemes £m in  alone from programmes stretching back a decade and the stake he still has in the company is worth over £m mention of the criticism directed his way over his rich rewards is the only time he becomes faintly prickly rivals have it differently he notes i think this is a function of the uk omnicom can issue options at very low prices with very little criticism publicis quoted in france can put in incentive schemes without revealing performance criteria senior staff at wpp he adds are asked to invest their money in the company and hold the shares for five years before any payouts are possible through its share scheme you mention criticism but what did i do virtually with one exception i kept all my stock for  years and suffered with the recent changes in legislation he says referring to the increase in capital gains tax the fact that i have held it for  years is not taken into any account at all so i am going to have to pay  more and the person who holds the stock for  minutes is treated exactly the same way it is just not right that is an incentive to go not stay in a testament to sorrells status george osborne the chancellor recently said the government would change rules on the taxation of foreign earnings in the hope that wpp would come back to britain after decamping to dublin two years ago so will he come back i havent moved the company has moved but the pleasing thing is that the conservatives have honoured their election pledge revoking taxation of overseas profits would be very meaningful he says but of course one of the things is that what the coalition government guarantees does not bind the next government the decision he says will be for the board bathshaped recession if viewed huffily by his own peers sorrell is feted elsewhere with invitations to the obama inauguration and to the world economic forum in davos he has attained fame for his pronouncements on the economy his comment that the advertising recession at the start of the decade was bathshaped was often repeated  poor mans sage of soho as michael grade damningly describes me it is a putdown isnt it he asks his reading of the recent economic runes was luvshaped – the l representing western europe the u the united states and the v the fastgrowing emergent economies such as china or india that has since been altered to lvv reflecting his belief that the us will rebound faster than thought providing evidence wpps revenues in the first five months of  are up  on a likeforlike basis  in may alone but then in his last big interview with the guardian in  he said with some certainty that there would not be a global recession he laughs we have been pretty accurate after the recession though tanned and looking at least a decade younger than his  years sorrell still keeps to a punishing schedule splitting his time between london and new york his devotion to the company apparently cost his first marriage which ended in a £m divorce settlement in  his former wife complaining she had been marginalised the first half of the interview is in his office down the road from film director guy ritchies pub the punchbowl the rest is in the car he pulls out a piece of paper and reads that days schedule a presentation to institutional investors a session with an analyst lunch with google a meeting with a client this interview the industry panel and then a business dinner he doesnt consider retirement only when they shoot me he says in hushed tones the increasingly global nature of the business the fragmentation of media and technology and the everquickening pace make it all the more absorbing he says but can it just all get too much in a medical sense i probably get stressed but i dont regard it that way i am just annoyed when things arent going right and it is very personal you know the bill shankly quote about football it is not a matter of

robert andrews on march  june   robertandrews what does a  billion market cap earn the world’s largest ad agency holding group a status as amongst the most diversified and forwardthinking of communications agencies out there when sir martin sorrell took a controlling stake in what was then a shopping basket maker wire  plastic products in  little did most peers suspect the former saatchi  saatchi finance chief would go on to make wpp as influential as it is today wpp’s scale has grown steadily through a seeminglyneverending series of acquisitions and investments these days it is almost rarer for a week to go by when wpp hasn’t been involved in such a deal as the company builds up an arsenal of marketing data analytics content production and other units so what is in sorrell’s crystal ball for the years ahead “i think we’ll see more consolidation there will also be a blurring of the lines” he tells beettv in this video interview for beettv’s “media revolutionaries” series that blurring is occurring partly as marketing technology vendors who already help clients understand customer data buy in to datadriven adtech platforms and vice versa wpp’s ceo sees an emerging middle ground on which multiple large players will all offer all manner of services their founders could not have dreamed of but these days marketing firms are also editorial content makers and content platforms are also analytics providers “when people talk about who our competitors are we think about omnicom or we think about publicis ipg havas or dentsu or ipsos gfk or nielsen” sorrell says “but we also think about google facebook amazon alibaba we also think about deloitte consulting and accenture “those lines are going to get more and more blurred you see what salesforce is trying to do what adobe is trying to do what oracle with its acquisition of datalogix is trying to do this is all a blurring of the lines” it is no wonder lines are blurring wpp itself has lately been buying in to an array of mead segments recent deals include pieces of spanish football rightsholder imagina house of cards studio mrc and youtube multichannel network fullscreen longform digital video producer indigenous media fullscreen and vice media the company has even invested in the formation of a new sports marketing firm bruin sports capital to double down on popular live sports and sorrell calls wpp “a content company” as well as everything else but it is recent stakes in measurement firms comscore andrentrak and stake in ad tech company appnexus that underscore wpp’s interest in numbers “all these are good examples of us putting a stake in the ground in tech data sports and entertainment” sorrell adds “from a functional point of view it’s going to become more and more competitive” next wpp is rumoured to be preparing a bid to buy dunnhumby the data marketing specialist that has been the catalyst behind much of uk supermarket giant tesco’s growth according to wsj so

martin sorrell simon rogers jul  wpp chief executive sir martin sorrell oversees operations in over  countries and a workforce of thousands hes an evangelist for the new technologies shaping our world  not as a geek or a gadget freak but as the hardest of hardheaded businessmen in this wideranging interview he discusses his approach to marketing technology and the changes affecting the business world great white sharks cannot stop swimming if they do they suffocate and die similarly sir martin sorrell finds it hard to stand still our meeting in a london pub is squeezed between a visit to turkey talks at downing street and a flight to mumbai the head of the world’s largest advertising corporation also has his eyes on iran and cuba change and innovation are his lifeblood sorrell’s rise would make great material for mad men creator matthew weiner our plucky protagonist buys a shopping basket company and uses it to take over the world well some of the world’s bestknown ad firms anyway when he’s done he goes to china and becomes the top man there now he’s got his sights set on the middle east and all this against three decades of momentous social political and economic change such are sorrell’s dramatic fortunes the yearold head of wpp oversees operations in over  countries and a workforce of thousands he’s an evangelist for the new technologies shaping our world – not as a geek or a gadget freak but as the hardest of hardheaded businessmen nor can he stay out of the public eye the day after the uk’s chancellor of the exchequer george osborne’s  budget announced big slashes to corporation tax sorrell announced he would take wpp back to the uk having relocated to dublin in  as we meet half a million people have just marched through london protesting against government spending cuts a few hundred rioted through the capital keeping one step ahead of the police via social networks and cell phones it’s against this backdrop that sorrell points to the difficulty in maintaining a single message “while some demonstrators were trying to get their message across in a peaceful and ordered way it gets inextricably interlinked with the more violent stuff the two things get confused” he says clients have the perception that the bigger you are the worse you get we try and break that down innovation is the ability to differentiate “in the old days you could segment happily you could put out one message to one segment of the audience and one to another that has now gone you say something to one community and instantly literally at a click it’s available to everybody what it means is that if you’re trying to craft a message it’s very difficult” for sorrell that lack of control is symptomatic of the new world “i’m in a business where there’s complete anarchy you can’t control it – you can only react to it the control that people traditionally had over their message is gone look at wikileaks you have to approach everything you write on the basis it’s going to be on the front page of the newspaper” stocky and toughlooking his face bears the legacy of a car accident at  which required extensive plastic surgery sorrell is a coiled spring – restlessly shifting while we talk he attributes his drive to “the pressure cooker effect” of harvard business school after graduating he joined saatchi  saatchi rising to the role of group finance director before striking out on his own at february’s mobile world congress in barcelona sorrell gave a talk entitled ‘the power of apps’ his business increasingly revolves around mobile communications and what they can offer the client wpp is encouraging its established brands to invest in mobile talent and exhorting its online agencies to embrace mobile in a more aggressive way “mobile for us is part of the online revolution” he says the side effect of all this is that “our willingness to sit down and really dig deep and take time to digest turn over and develop more is rapidly diminishing because so much stuff is coming at you at such a pace – literally  “it’s a disadvantage of the revolution” he continues “people used to say that information is power but that’s no longer the case it’s analysis of the data use of the data digging into it – that is the power you get so much of the stuff and everyone has access to it” his interest in technology isn’t so much personal he doesn’t innovate for its own sake but as a means to an end sorrell cares about what it can do not what it is he plunks down a blackberry and an ordinary nokia mobile on the table in front of us he has two phones because he says he hasn’t “got the mental stamina to unite the two” he doesn’t use twitter or facebook “i suppose i’m a bit of a fuddyduddy” but his day revolves around breaking news live business channels and his new ipad  he no longer uses his pc “i don’t like schlepping a laptop around the place so i don’t travel with one” with its global reach and profile has wpp become too huge to be innovative sorrell’s argument is that wire and plastic products plc was itself a genuine game changer a british shopping basket manufacturer acquired by sorrell when he was casting around for a listed corporate shell in  it now owns famous ad brands such as jwt ogilvy  mather young  rubicam and grey – as well as media investment giant groupm “we’re interested in the application of technology – not its origination we’re not in the garage with sergey and larry” wpp’s first board meeting in china was in  now the country accounts for around bn of business and sorrell describes its government’s fiveyear plan as a “charter for wpp” he retains a tight control but is quick to point out that wpp is an amorphous agglomeration of  different companies “clients have the perception that the bigger you are the worse you get” he admits “we try and break that down innovation is the ability to differentiate” for sorrell this means working out what technology can do “we’re interested in the application of technology – not its origination” he explains “we’re not in the garage with google cofounders sergey and larry coming up with the ideas or dropping out of stanford or harvard to do that we’re taking those ideas and applying them in a way that differentiates us” an interesting question is whether an innovator like facebook’s mark zuckerberg could have flourished at a company like wpp “mark zuckerberg wouldn’t have been comfortable working in any company – other than going into the garage and starting his own” replies sorrell “that’s what i did in  my garage was wire and plastic products” though a man whose business relies on hard data and evidence sorrell isn’t averse to leaving some things to fate he wears two brazilian wristbands given to him on a new year vacation each one promises to make three wishes come true when the string rots away “it’s not for effect” he insists “i am a bit superstitious the wishes haven’t come true yet so i can’t tell you what they are” away from the office one of sorrell’s big passions is cricket he tries to play  matches a year but is frustrated by being “a plodder a grafter slow but sure… you’re either good or you’re bad” he muses as our time draws to a close “it’s black or white isn’t it you don’t want to be average” sir martin sorrell unvital statistics what is your earliest memory my mother closing my little

lawsuit against television audience measurement tam a joint venture of the former competitors nielsen and kantar media research which for years has provided the only tv audience measurement system in india wpp plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of kantar and imrb ndtvs lawsuit filed in the new york state supreme court under the foreign corrupt practices act and seeking  billion for negligence and hundreds of millions for interference and breach of fiduciary duty cited a public conversation between vikram chandra ceo of ndtv and martin sorrell ceo of wpp in which chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful wpp responded that the lawsuit had not been served on wpp or any of its operating companies the new york court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal seeking legal costs and that it was considering a lawsuit against ndtv for defamation a threat which ndtv in turn called baseless the motion to dismiss was filed a week later with the statement in its memorandum of law that this case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff a television station in new delhi india to drum up media coverage in india to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years  new delhi tv has crossed the globe and come to new york state supreme court to complain about an indian company tam and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in india the motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on  december  nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal writing that ndtv attempts to transform a potential contract claim against tam into tort and oral contract claims against the nielsen defendants nothing in the law supports such a magic trick simply put ndtv fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action referencesedit  a b c preliminary results  pdf wpp plc retrieved  april

nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff a television station in new delhi india to drum up media coverage in india to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years  new delhi tv has crossed the globe and come to new york state supreme court to complain about an indian company tam and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in india the motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on  december  nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal writing that ndtv attempts to transform a potential contract claim against tam into tort and oral contract claims against the nielsen defendants nothing in the law supports such a magic trick simply put ndtv fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action referencesedit  a b c preliminary results  pdf wpp plc retrieved  april
