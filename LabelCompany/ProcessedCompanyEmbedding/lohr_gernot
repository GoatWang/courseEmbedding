current apollo global management llc private equity apollo global private equity is a contrarian valueoriented investor with significant expertise in distressed opportunities the firm focuses on opportunities where they can serve as a catalyst for businesstransforming events and create significant value they invest primarily in the following sectors  chemicals  commodities  consumer and retail  distribution and transportation  financial services and business services  manufacturing and industrial  media cable and leisure  packaging and materials and  satellite and wirelessapollo global private equity seeks to capitalize on market dislocations through a traditional and distressed buyout approach they seek to make attractive investments by buying the debt of quality businesses converting that debt to equity creating value through active participation with management and ultimately monetizing the investment the firms private equity investment activities are executed through several strategies including traditional buyouts distressed buyouts and debt investments and corporate partner buyoutshistorically traditional buyouts have comprised the majority of the firms investments apollo global private equity generally targets investments in companies with entrepreneurial management teams that are comfortable operating in a leveraged environment they also pursue acquisitions in which they believe a noncore business owned by a large corporation can function more effectively if structured as an independent entity their lbos generally involve consolidation situations through merger or followon acquisitions carveouts from larger organizations seeking to shed noncore assets situations requiring structured ownership to meet a sellers financial goals or situations in which the business plan involves a substantial departure from past practicesfor their distressed buyout and debt investments apollo global private equity targets assets with highquality operating businesses but lowquality balance sheets the distressed securities they purchase include bank debt public highyield debt and privatelyheld instruments often with significant downside protection in the form of a senior position in the capital structurethough corporate partner buyouts the firm seeks to capitalize on investment opportunities during environments in which purchase prices for control of companies are at high multiplies of earnings apollo global private equity focuses on companies that need a financial partner to consummate acquisitions expand product lines buy back stock or pay down debt in these investments the firm does not seek control but instead makes significant investments that typically allow them to obtain control rights similar to those that they require in traditional buyoutsin addition to traditional distressed and corporate partner buyout activities apollo global private equity also deploys the capital of their private equity funds in other types of investments such as the creation of new companies the firm seeks to capitalize on market opportunities they have identified particularly in assetintensive industries that are in distress in
