condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included in item  of this quarterly report on form q and with our audited financial statements included in our form k for the fiscal year ended june   filed with the securities and exchange commission on october   overview acquisition of imetabolic corp on december   we entered into an agreement of share exchange and plan of reorganization the share exchange agreement and consummated a share exchange the share exchange with imetabolic corp imet a nevada corporation as a result of the share exchange agreement the imet shareholders transferred all their interest in imet to the company and as a result imet became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company as a further condition of the share exchange agreement the then current officers of the company resigned on march   and mark w conte was appointed president ceo and a director of the company kevin j pikero as cfo treasurer secretary and a director and andrew d smith as a director the imet acquisition is discussed more fully in the form k we filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on march   included as an exhibit to that form k is a copy of the share exchange agreement name change on december   the company filed articles of merger the merger with the nevada secretary of state the merger was between the company and our whollyowned subsidiary upd holding corp the subsidiary pursuant to nevada corporate law we amended our articles of incorporation by the merger to change our name to upd holding corp we believe our new name more properly indicates our current lines of business because the company has not been in the water and beverage industry since  upd stands for united product development which is the name of one of our whollyowned subsidiaries we will be applying to finra to have our common stock traded under the new name and for a new trading symbol as soon as possible imet products imet was formed on july   for the purpose of marketing products under the brand imetabolic that were previously being sold by the brands licensor international metabolic institute llc imi as well as to develop new products that would be specifically suited for a national marketing plan imi transferred certain product and trademark rights to imet on july   the license the license was amended on march   to clarify imets and imis future rights see imet license agreement below the mission of imet is to build upon preexisting brand equity and the expert copy and other literature authored by dr kent sasse as applied to the national launch of products with extraordinary profitability and novel market appeal a preexisting line of five  softbound books authored by the founder of the imetabolic brand dr kent sasse is available for sale under the brand a sasse guide on both the wwwimetaboliccom and wwwsasseguidecom websites these books are titled i lifechanging weight loss ii doctors orders   medically proven tips for losing weight iii outpatient weight loss surgery  safe and successful weight loss with modern bariatric surgery iv weightloss surgery  which one is right for you and v after weight loss surgery a preexisting line of products including but not limited to proprietary blend meal replacements dietary specialty foods and nutraceuticals have been sold by imi at imis company store  doctors office pursuant to a reservation of rights in the license and online at wwwimetaboliccom an amendment to the license provides that after imi has sold its entire inventory existing or ordered on march   imi will not sell any more products which may be deemed to compete with imets products table of contents imet has developed the following four new products to be marketed a new product concept to be marketed under the name imetabolic catalyst which is intended to provide the essential vitamins and plant compounds that are necessary to aid in metabolic functions such ingredients include broad spectrum bcomplex vitamins as well as green tea extract and resveratrol polyphenols a new product concept to be marketed under the name imetabolic minimeal which is intended to provide the essential whey protein isolate intake for a person who is on a fourtofive meal per day diet or needs a snack that will act as a lowcalorie high nutritional value appetite suppressant a new product concept to be marketed under the name imetabolic multipro which is intended to provide the essential broadspectrum vitamins and minerals that are typically marketed as multivitamin supplements however this product is specifically tailored to dovetail with the catalyst so as to virtually eliminate the duplicate consumption of overlapping ingredients that routinely plagues supplement users a new product concept to be marketed under the name imetabolic bittx this product is premised on the scientific theory that modern horticulture and food producers have systematically promoted foods that are sweet or lack bitterness which is the flavor typically associated with foods that have the greatest health benefits accordingly this product is intended to reform the bodys disposition toward bitter foods in a subtle inoffensive way we believe imets current four products can be successfully marketed through the use of infomercials and have made progress with identifying a creator and producer for an infomercial to sell the products additionally the company is building a new website with ecommerce capabilities and plans to use seo search engine optimization social media email marketing and ppc pay for click venues as well to drive the business however there is no assurance imets infomercial marketing strategy will be successful we have also investigated using regional distributors for our products and may use them in the future on a region by region basis as working capital permits the company has identified some prospects and is working to move those prospects forward we believe imet has located experienced nutrition and supplemental manufacturers who have indicated an interest and an ability to manufacture imets initial four products we have received written cost quotations from these manufactures and production timetables as well the company is in the process of evaluating the best venue to move forward the company was hopeful that it was going to be able to secure its new website marketing program and product manufacturing schedules to begin marketing our products within six months of the closing of the exchange in reality these details are taking more time to prepare and thus the company is now targeting some initial product and marketing launches in    imet license agreement imet entered into a license with imi a nevada limited liability company on july   the license in the license imi granted to imet the exclusive licenses to use produce market and sell i five marks the licensed marks ii four books written by dr sasse the licensed content and iii approximately  supplements and foods created and previously sold by imi the licensed articles the licensed marks include the trademark imetabolic the domain name wwwimetaboliccom the trademark imetabolic catalyst and a trademark and domain name related to dr sasse in conjunction with closing the exchange on march   imi and imet executed an amendment to the license the license amendment in the license amendment i imet returned to imi all rights to the licensed content dr sasses books the two dr sasse licensed marks and all revenues from the sale of the licensed articles since july   through the date of closing the exchange ii the initial term was increased from three to four years iii a provision was added stating that after the closing of the exchange imi shall not sell any more of the licensed articles or any other products imet deems as competing with the licensed articles iv a provision was added stating that upon reaching the  million milestone imi shall transfer and or assign to imet the three remaining licensed marks and v a provision was added stating that upon completion of the initial term imet shall have all rights obligations and burdens of enforcing the licensed marks during  the trademark imetabolic expired at the us patent and trademark office in conjunction with the closing of the exchange imi reapplied for that trademark and the service mark imetabolic on december   in may  we engaged drinker biddle  reath llp to correspond with the us patent and trademark office regarding our application as of april   the company was awarded registration

initiate a proposed funding arrangement for future capital demands this  escrow was funded by two private placements which have convertible notes associated with them the notes the companys efforts to secure funding are continuing and the company is hopeful without assurance that substantial funding will be obtained in the near future the notes are convertible on march   at  per share if share conversion is not elected then interest will be due on the notes in the amount of  at december   the company had a total of  shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of the notes  of the  private placement was funded by the companys president over the next twelve months we have estimated that in order to maintain reporting company status as defined under the securities exchange act of  as amended we will require cash for general and administrative expenses and professional fees which include accounting legal and other professional fees as well as filing fees we believe we will be able to meet these costs through the use of existing cash and cash equivalents or additional amounts as necessary to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors however no assurance can be given that we will be able to raise additional capital when needed or at all or that such capital if available will be on acceptable terms in the absence of obtaining additional

   table of contents   item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included in item  of this quarterly report on form q and with our audited financial statements included in our form k for the fiscal year ended june   filed with the securities and exchange commission on october     overview   acquisition of imetabolic corp   on december    we entered into an agreement of share exchange and plan of reorganization the “share exchange agreement” and consummated a share exchange the “share exchange” with imetabolic corp “imet” a nevada corporation  the effective date of the transaction was march   the “effective date” and resulted in the acquisition of imet the “acquisition”  pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of imet from the  imet shareholders for an aggregate of  shares or  of the company’s common stock   as a result of the share exchange agreement the imet shareholders transferred all their interest in imet to the company and as a result imet became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company   as a further condition of the share exchange agreement the then current officers of the company resigned on march   and mark w conte was appointed president ceo and a director of the company kevin j pikero as cfo treasurer secretary and a director and andrew d smith as a director   the imet acquisition is discussed more fully in the form k we filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” on march   included as an exhibit to that form k is a copy of the share exchange agreement   name change   on december   the company filed articles of merger the “merger” with the nevada secretary of state the merger was between the company and our whollyowned subsidiary upd holding corp the “subsidiary” pursuant to nevada corporate law we amended our articles of incorporation by the merger to change our name to upd holding corp we believe our new name more properly indicates our current lines of business because the company has not been in the water and beverage industry since  “upd” stands for united product development which is the name of one of our whollyowned subsidiaries we will be applying to finra to have our common stock traded under the new name and for a new trading symbol as soon as possible   imet products   imet was  formed on july   for the purpose of marketing products under the brand “imetabolic” that were previously being sold by the brand’s licensor international metabolic institute llc “imi” as well as to develop new products that would be specifically suited for a national marketing plan  imi transferred certain product and trademark rights to imet on july   the “license”  the license was amended on march   to clarify imet’s and imi’s future rights see “imet license agreement” below the mission of imet is to build upon preexisting brand equity and the expert copy and other literature authored by dr kent sasse as applied to the national launch of products with extraordinary profitability and novel market appeal   a preexisting line of five  softbound books authored by the founder of the imetabolic brand dr kent sasse is available for sale under the brand “a sasse guide” on both the wwwimetaboliccom and wwwsasseguidecom websites these books are titled i lifechanging weight loss ii doctor’s orders –  medically proven tips for losing weight iii outpatient weight loss surgery – safe and successful weight loss with modern bariatric surgery iv weightloss surgery – which one is right for you and v after weight loss surgery  pursuant to the terms of the license amendment these books will continue to be the property of and sold by imi    a preexisting line of products including but not limited to proprietary blend meal replacements dietary specialty foods and nutraceuticals have been sold by imi at imi’s company store  doctor’s office pursuant to a reservation of rights in the license and online at wwwimetaboliccom  an amendment to the license provides that after imi has sold its entire inventory existing or ordered on march   imi will not sell any more products which may be deemed to compete with imet’s products    table of contents imet has developed the following four new products to be marketed     • a new product concept to be marketed under the name imetabolic “catalyst” which is intended to provide the essential vitamins and plant compounds that are necessary to aid in metabolic functions such ingredients include broad spectrum bcomplex vitamins as well as green tea extract and resveratrol polyphenols     • a new product concept to be marketed under the name imetabolic “minimeal” which is intended to provide the essential whey protein isolate intake for a person who is on a fourtofive meal per day diet or needs a snack that will act as a lowcalorie high nutritional value appetite suppressant     • a new product concept to be marketed under the name imetabolic “multipro” which is intended to provide the essential broadspectrum vitamins and minerals that are typically marketed as “multivitamin supplements” however this product is specifically tailored to dovetail with the “catalyst” so as to virtually eliminate the duplicate consumption of overlapping ingredients that routinely plagues supplement users     • a new product concept to be marketed under the name imetabolic “bittx” this product is premised on the scientific theory that modern horticulture and food producers have systematically promoted foods that are sweet or lack bitterness which is the flavor typically associated with foods that have the greatest health benefits accordingly this product is intended to reform the body’s disposition toward bitter foods in a subtle inoffensive way   we believe imet’s current four products can be successfully marketed through the use of infomercials and have made progress with identifying a creator and producer for an infomercial to sell the products additionally the company is building a new website with ecommerce capabilities and plans to use seo search engine optimization social media email marketing and ppc pay for click venues as well to drive the business however there is no assurance imet’s infomercial marketing strategy will be successful   we have also investigated using regional distributors for our products and may use them in the future on a region by region basis as working capital permits the company has identified some prospects and is working to move those prospects forward   we believe imet has located experienced nutrition and supplemental manufacturers who have indicated an interest and an ability to manufacture imet’s initial four products  we have received written cost quotations from these manufactures and production timetables as well the company is in the process of evaluating the best venue to move forward   the company was hopeful that it was going to be able to secure its new website marketing program and product manufacturing schedules to begin marketing our products within six months of the closing of the exchange in reality these details are taking more time to prepare and thus the company is now targeting some initial product and marketing launches in  –    imet license agreement   imet entered into a license with imi a nevada limited liability company on july   the “license”  in the license imi granted to imet the exclusive licenses to use produce market and sell i five marks the “licensed marks” ii four books written by dr sasse the “licensed content” and iii approximately  supplements and foods created and previously sold by imi the “licensed articles”  the licensed marks include the trademark “imetabolic” the domain name “wwwimetaboliccom” the trademark “imetabolic catalyst” and a trademark and domain name related to dr sasse  the license had a term of three years commencing on july   the “initial term” with a provision stating that the term of the license would automatically become perpetual if imet sold  million of licensed content or licensed articles before july   imet is to bear all expenses of the creation and sale of the licensed content and licensed articles  the license contains other provisions standard in licenses   in conjunction with closing the exchange on march   imi and imet executed an amendment to the license the “license amendment” in the license amendment i imet returned to imi all rights to the licensed content dr sasse’s books the two dr sasse licensed marks and all revenues from the sale of the licensed articles since july   through the date of closing the exchange ii the initial term was increased from three to four years iii a provision was added stating that after the closing of the exchange imi shall not sell any more of the licensed articles or any other products imet deems as competing with the licensed articles iv a provision was added stating that upon reaching the  million milestone imi shall transfer and or assign to imet the three remaining licensed marks and v a provision was added stating that upon completion of the initial term imet shall have all rights obligations and burdens of enforcing the licensed marks   during  the trademark “imetabolic” expired at the us patent and trademark office  in conjunction with the closing of the exchange imi reapplied for that trademark and the service mark imetabolic on december    in may  we engaged drinker biddle  reath llp to correspond with the us patent and trademark office regarding our application  as of april   the company was awarded registration number  in the class  category additionally on september   the company was awarded registration number  in the class  category at this

 through unanimous approval by its board the company opened a  escrow to initiate a proposed funding arrangement for future capital demands this  escrow was funded by two private placements which have convertible notes associated with them the “notes”  the companys efforts to secure funding are continuing and the company is hopeful without assurance that substantial funding will be obtained in the near future   the notes are convertible on march   at  per share if share conversion is not elected then interest will be due on the notes in the amount of  at december   the company had a total of  shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of the notes  of the  private placement was funded by the company’s president   over the next twelve months we have estimated that in order to maintain reporting company status as defined under the securities exchange act of  as amended we will require cash for general and administrative expenses and professional fees which include accounting legal and other professional fees as well as filing fees we believe we will be able to meet these costs through the use of existing cash and cash equivalents or additional amounts as necessary to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors however no assurance can be given that we will be able to raise additional capital when needed or at all or that such capital if available will be on acceptable terms in the absence of obtaining additional financing we may be unable to fund our operations as a result the company’s independent registered public accounting firm
