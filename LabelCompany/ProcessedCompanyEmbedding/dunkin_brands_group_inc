million a number only exceeded by two other brands this is according to nations restaurant news top  chain results survey for the consumers needs the expectations are shifting and that is why we invested significantly in consumer research last year so that we could position ourselves to address the change in marketplace we are very excited about the progress that we have made on our multiyear

growth opportunities for baskinrobbins in the us and canada these changes represent our commitment to people by developing talent within dunkin brands to build for the future i believe we have a nice balance of established leaders and people who have been internally groomed through our succession process and leaders like dave who have come from outside of the company im proud of and energized by how the organization has handled our recent leadership changes now back to our second quarter results ill let dave cover dunkin us comps but our  comps for the quarter was an encouraging improvement over the first quarter id like now to revisit a topic that i addressed on the first quarter earnings call and thats our franchisees commitment to dunkin donuts brand over the past two years our dunkin donuts us franchisees have invested more than  billion in their restaurants and they continue to open more net new stores than almost any other brand in the qsr space which has led to top tier systemwide sales increases year by year additionally as you know from time to time we offer our franchisees the opportunity to renew the term remaining on their franchise agreements to get them back to  years thats of course assuming they are uptodate with their remodel schedule we opened this opportunity earlier this year and our franchisees have responded so positively to it that they have well exceeded our expectations yeartodate for renewals of their agreements as a matter of fact at the end of q nearly  of all dunkin donuts restaurants had greater than  years remaining on their franchise agreements this constancy in our franchise base is a major contributor to the consistent results that our  franchise business model delivers obviously this level of term renewal is great news financially but more importantly its a sign of our franchisees longterm commitment to the brand they continue to demonstrate that they want to put their money back into dunkin donuts and indeed are pushing to extend their contracts on a concerted basis which brings me to our updated development guidance that we provided in our press release earlier today we now are expecting dunkin donuts us franchisees to open between  and  net new restaurants this year previously we expected them to open approximately  so let me discuss why we are doing this firstly were underway on the design of our next dunkin donuts restaurant image and we plan to have beta locations in market later this year and have it ready to begin a national launch in the second half of  we believe this new design will be transformational from a design equipment and technology perspective and we want our franchisees to have the capital to build the greatest number of restaurants in the new image over the next few years secondly our franchisees have significant numbers of renewals coming due in the couple of years and we want them to be able to convert as many of these as possible to the new look with these factors in mind we recently sat down with a group of leadership franchisees to walk them through all the work thats been done to evolve the dunkin donuts brand and the planned timing of the new image we discussed the most effective use of that capital over the next few years so that we can strike the right balance between driving smart growth and ensuring the current store base reflects our new image which we believe will bring even stronger returns to our franchisees and to dunkin brands as a result of this were revising our expected net openings for  i truly believe its a testament to our ongoing focus on franchisee relationships and franchisee profitability that were having this strategic conversation with our franchisees and that were aligned as a system to ensure continued quality growth across the us and the longterm relevance and sustainability of the dunkin donuts brand i want to be clear this does not mean that all new restaurants and remodels that our franchisees complete in  will be in the new design were also working through plans on how and when to make it available to franchisees particularly for remodels and once we release the new design franchisees will begin incorporating it into their development plans but we are laying the groundwork now to ensure that they can build and convert the greatest number of restaurants to the new image over the next few years i also want to emphasize very clearly that were not changing  guidance for revenue operating income or earnings per share a couple of more things id like to share in regards to dunkin donuts us restaurant growth first our franchisees have opened more than  net new stores from  to  and have added nearly  billion in new first year sales to our dunkin donuts us system going forward systemwide sales growth is a number we will likely focus on in our discussions with you as this metric really demonstrates organic growth of our business and the quality of our net new restaurant developments and additionally we are pleased to announce that the  cohort of traditional new stores in the west and emerging regions finished at approximately  cashoncash returns this is truly great news and as a reminder the west for us means everything west to the mississippi not just california i agree its a slightly strange region obviously in an area that contains states as widely diverse as california utah and louisiana cashoncash returns will vary widely however this is the point i think youve been waiting to hear however in our most important high opportunity states like california our franchisees are enjoying higher returns than the average in closing we expect that dunkin donuts us will finish the year yet again as one of the fastest growing restaurant concepts in the country by both unit count and by increases in systemwide sales with that im going to hand it over to my friend dave who will cover the dunkin donuts us performance dave david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc thanks nigel and hello to everyone on todays call in the next few minutes i plan to touch on results and also tease out how were operationalizing elements of our plan so let me begin with results in the second quarter our systemwide sales grew nearly  in the us driven by new store growth and comparable store sales comparable store sales were  as ticket growth was offset by traffic declines ticket and traffic remained largely the same as q apart from a slight easing in traffic declines from a daypart perspective we are encouraged by our morning comp growth as it outpaced our reported full day comp growth price held steady while weather was a slight headwind in the quarter particularly in the month of may which was unseasonably cool and wet in our core markets now from a category standpoint breakfast sandwich sales were strong driven by wakeup wraps and core sandwiches as well as through innovative offerings like our pretzel croissant breakfast sandwich and on the beverage side iced coffee sales continued to grow as a result of our cold brew platform the iced tea category was also up driven by the launch of fruited iced tea and while we had a very successful launch of frozen dunkin coffee which is a strong addition to our beverage lineup youll continue to see us build that out and that platform out through the addition of flavors such as the recently introduced smores going forward we continue to expect low singledigit comparable store sales growth for dunkin us for the remainder of  weve talked extensively in the past about our sixpart strategic plan to transform dunkin into a beverageled onthego brand now we are bringing that plan to life at the restaurant level as we operationalize this plan let me take you through the progress todate and the sequencing going forward its worth noting that we built this plan with our franchisee leadership and it speaks to our alignment and laserfocus to drive our future together looking first at menu for the balance of  we will have a maniacal focus on our core strengths first and foremost extending our coffee leadership in the category through products like our newly launched frozen coffee platform to the highly successful readytodrink coffee line with cocacola as well as advertising that speaks to our unmatched quality the recent campaign this is coffee highlights why we are number one in the hot drip coffee market second well continue to focus on donuts this is a category in which we have significant equity as the number one retailer nationally and given our scale we have an ability to offer fun and innovative products at a great value as compared to the boutique players in this space the recent cake batter donut and current smores donuts are great examples of this and youll continue to see us double down on our donut mojo in the back half of  and finally well focus on delivering a compelling national value message such as the two for  wakeup wrap offer thats underway now and its important to note that while we have had regional value offerings in the past the focus on national value is relatively new to us and underscores the alignment and unity that we have with our franchisees behind the plan now id like to provide an update on our menu simplification efforts and while it may sound counterintuitive a key underpinning of menu innovation â again a key underpinning of menu innovation is menu simplification which enables us to take complexities that have crept into the restaurants over the last several years out of the system menu simplification is all about creating room for growth for the next wave of innovation as a beverageled onthego brand as you know we introduced a simplified menu into  restaurants earlier this year and are very pleased with the results and as nigel mentioned upfront we will be expanding the streamlined menu to an additional  restaurants by october for a total of  locations we will roll it out in two phases the first by the end of august and the second by october providence rhode island a major market for us will be included in the first wave in august i know that there is significant interest in the number of skus being eliminated and the percentage of the menu that has been removed at this point its still premature for us to share specifics but we can assure you that classics like the bacon egg and cheese on a croissant are staying on the menu some examples of things that have been removed are afternoon sandwiches a few muffin and bagel varieties and some bakery items like danishes and cookies we will continue to tweak the simplified menu using feedback from customers franchisees and employees as we move into the next phase going forward however we still believe that benefits of the simplified menu in the long run will help drive top line and bottom line from improved customer throughput happier crew and managers and ultimately increased restaurant level margins as weve said before simplification will continue to be a cultural mindset for our system we want to make our restaurant simpler and easier to operate in addition to this we are also working on an updated pos system design to make life easier at the store level as well besides menu the next strategic aspect of the plan is to offer our customers unparalleled convenience that sets us apart from any other concept in the category we know from our research that guests use us as an onthego brand so making ourselves increasingly more convenient for consumers is an essential part of who we are and who we want to be our goal is to be agnostic as to how our guests use dunkin essentially allowing them to order how they want pay how they want and get the beverages and food the way they want taste and quality are still king for us but we also want to offer a frictionless experience for our guests bringing about this transformation demands that we look at every aspect of our restaurant operations and our store design including the drivethru in fact going forward we expect to see an even greater percentage of dunkin restaurants opening with drivethrus in  we anticipate that approximately  of our traditional store openings will have a drivethru compared to only  five years ago this increased emphasis on drivethrus is a big part of our strategy to be an onthego brand and we want to make the dunkin drivethru experience the best in the industry in addition to unparalleled convenience this also relies very heavily on new uses of technology key to this is our perks loyalty program and today we sit at nearly  million members dd perks makes our members feel valued and appreciated via offers rewards and access to onthego mobile ordering and in return we receive rich customer data that we can leverage to drive onetoone marketing and incremental sales quality of the user experience is a constant focus for us and as we approach the five star ratings in both the itunes app store and google play we believe this is how todays guests want to interact with their favorite brands additionally under the headline of differentiating ourselves through unparalleled convenience were pleased to announce that we are now making curbside delivery an option for all of our franchisees curbside will provide dd perks guests the option of having their orders brought right to their cars and gives us one more avenue to build on with our super convenience strategy worth noting we are also expanding our delivery program to the miami market this month via our partnership with doordash and coming later this year we will be piloting a catering test on our newly designed website dunkindonutscom catering is not new to us as many franchisees have been providing the service for years however what will be new is the online catering feature and a more unified approach across the system part three of our strategic plan is to give consumers increased accessibility to our brand and thats going to be through the addition of new restaurants through partnerships like our agreement with amtrak to serve our hot coffee on the acela express highspeed trains and also through branded consumer products offered outside our restaurants such as what i recently mentioned the new readytodrink iced coffees in partnership with cocacola and in fact were very pleased with the early progress of this product as we just did doubledigits on market share as for new unit growth in q dunkin us franchisees opened  net new restaurants versus  net new units last year our franchisees also completed a  remodels during the quarter okay finally the fourth element of our plan is restaurant excellence our franchisees take a lot of pride in running great restaurants but we all know that youre only as good as your last visit that said we believe structural initiatives such as the simplified menu will help our franchisees reduce labor turnover a major concern in the state labor market obviously and allow them to focus on the basics of fast accurate and friendly service as you can hear we are well underway with our multiyear plan to transform dunkin into a beverageled onthego brand weve a lot of heavy lifting still to do but i am confident in our us blueprint for growth focused on menu innovation unparalleled convenience broad accessibility and restaurant excellence then you wrap all of this with a more modern and relevant brand expression including new restaurant designs that nigel talked about and were confident that this plan will put our system on the next wave of longterm sustainable growth in closing i am energized by the alignment of our great franchisees and brand employees alike together we are committed to growing dunkin in a smart responsible way to ensure the continued relevancy of the brand and i look forward to sharing and most importantly showing you more about our brand evolution at our investor and analyst day which well be hosting in boston this february  so stay tuned for more details on that so with that i will now turn the call back over to nigel to go through our baskinrobbins us and international results nigel nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc thanks dave baskinrobbins us restaurant store sales were negative during the second quarter driven by a decline in traffic offset by increased average ticket we were excited to announce the launch of home delivery following on the trend that dave talked about of home delivery through our partner doordash which rolled out on june  now more than  baskinrobbins locations in  cities will be supported by doordash delivery including atlanta chicago dallas los angeles new york city and san francisco given that were experiencing comparable store sales declines two quarters into the year we are revising our full year  target for baskinrobbins us to slightly negative comparable store sales now to international baskinrobbins international had a strong quarter from a comparable store sales point of view the focus on value and trade up programs were particularly impactful in the key markets of japan and korea restaurant growth was driven by the middle east and korea dunkin donuts international continues to be in stabilization mode with dunkin korea being responsible for the majority of store closings in the second quarter for the segment theyre conducting a review of their restaurant portfolio and closing older unprofitable locations as a result they informed us that they will be closing more locations than they previously expected therefore we now expect international franchisees and licensees to open between  and  net new restaurants outside of the us in  im passing on now to kate jaspon kate jaspon  dunkin brands group inc thank you nigel revenue for the second quarter increased approximately  million or  compared to the prior year period due primarily to increased royalty income as well as an increase in rental income the increase was offset by a decrease of sales in companyoperated restaurants as a reminder we sold all of our companyowned restaurants in fiscal  also offsetting the increase in revenue was a decrease in sales of ice cream primarily through our licensees in the middle east as well as a decrease in other revenues operating income and adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased  million or  and  million or nearly  respectively from the prior year these increases were primarily the result of increase in royalty income and increase in rental margins and a decrease in our general and administrative expenses the second quarter decrease in ga reflects our ongoing focus on being diligent around our expense the increases in operating income and adjusted operating income were offset by a  million gain recognized in connection with the sale of our companyoperated restaurants in the second quarter of the prior year as well as a decrease in other revenues net income and adjusted net income for the second quarter each increased by approximately  million or  compared to the prioryear period primarily as a result of the increases in operating income and adjusted operating income offset by an increase in income tax expense diluted earnings per share and diluted adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter increased by approximately  to  per share and  to  per share respectively compared to the prioryear period as a result of the increases in net income and adjusted net income respectively offset by an increase in shares outstanding the increase in shares outstanding from the prioryear period was primarily due to the exercise of stock options and the new accounting standard adopted in the first quarter of  offset by the repurchases of shares since our second quarter of fiscal  excluding the impact of excess tax benefits recognized diluted earnings per share and diluted adjusted earnings per share would have been approximately  lower for the quarter at the end of the second quarter we had a debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of  our effective tax rate for the quarter was  during the quarter we generated approximately  million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with  million of cash and shortterm restricted cash on the balance sheet of that  million  million represents cash associated with our gift card programs and the marketing fund balances we used approximately  million of cash during the quarter to pay our q cash dividend to our shareholders during the second quarter we repurchased approximately  million shares of common stock at a weighted average cost per share of  under the  million accelerated share repurchase agreement that we entered into may this accelerated share repurchase essentially offsets any dilution that we expect for  from the exercise of options and therefore was contemplated in our original  eps guidance in closing i think its important to once again highlight that despite revising certain store development expectations for the year we are maintaining our revenue growth operating income growth and earnings per share targets for fiscal  with that i will turn it over to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question will come from the line of john glass with morgan stanley please go ahead your line is now open john glass  morgan stanley  co llc thanks very much first just on the reduction in the store growth for this year nigel do you think this is the right run rate to think of the dunkin growth in future years or is this a half step as you think about more investment needs in the core business for the existing stores so that it may slow further as that process unfolds nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so john thank you for the question good morning what id say is that we always regard our ourselves as a truly strong development company i outlined some of the statistics this was a guide for this year only we only ever give guidance for the year we never go beyond the one year i think our franchisees are excited about our returns i think theyre excited about the new image theyre excited about the transformational plan that dave has laid over the last several months so well keep our foot to the ground the accelerator will go right down and i think    and so on will be as high as we can possibly achieve john glass  morgan stanley  co llc and do you think getting that incremental growth combined with the amount of remodels and some of the technology investments et cetera that franchisees are willing to fund that themselves or do you contemplate at some point as other brands have maybe coinvesting in some of these initiatives to make sure that they get done and that franchisees are pleased with the investments they need to make nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc very good question and i think its something thats historical certainly in my time the franchisees have funded it themselves and theyve done a great job so they are a group who really do like investing in their restaurants i mean its always intrigued me that franchisees truly like spending capital having said that i think the transformation is going to be so significant that its something well certainly consider weve made no decisions its something weve actually talked about we have noted as you point out what other brands have done cash is not a problem for us cash is something that could be helpful so its something that we will consider but i want to be absolutely clear we have made no decisions on investing with our franchisees so i dont want anyone to go away thinking that i said that we will john glass  morgan stanley  co llc okay thank you nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc thank you operator thank you sir our next question in queue will come from the line of john ivankoe with jpmorgan please go ahead your line is now open john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc yes hi thank you two questions if i may first just looking at the menu simplification just wondering what the learnings were in wave one on those first  stores how wave two might change just in terms of the overall focus more units less units how its priced what have you any type of operational organization and even going from  units to  units is obviously or approximately  units is a pretty big leap so what are you looking for in the completion of that  unit test to get it in all  units and if you wanted to do that how quickly could that happen nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so im going to pass over to dave david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah thanks john hey look chris is leading this effort for us so im going to have him jump in here as well on this but were very pleased with the first  some of those markets dont represent all of our core markets and so it was important that we be responsible and scale this to the next level so thats why the next  are in place but again we are excited about what we see in terms of especially the velocity that were seeing on the pl in food cost and then also the feedback that were getting in terms of crew and manager satisfaction theyre doing hand stands over this and then also one of the biggest things first and foremost is customer throughput and so across those three dimensions were very excited but we felt like we needed to drop in another wave to make sure we could validate everything but ill let chris touch on anything else there chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc sure thanks dave so great question john i think the reality of the operational benefit is being felt by people within our restaurants and youre seeing improvements in food costs youre seeing an easier labor model to execute and thats probably the biggest challenge that we face with our franchisees together on a regular basis as we look forward to expanding this we really want to make sure that the consumer benefits from it as well so all of the different things that you have to do within a restaurant to make sure that the consumers understand which products they might switch to if their favorite product is no longer available we want to make sure that were clearing room for growth so that the innovation pipeline can really kick in as we clear that room for growth and that we have products that are easy to execute along the model of what will be remaining â will be part of the blueprint for the future so this is a very deliberate process we went out and did consumer research we tested in small modules we expanded to a small set of stores now were going to  stores and then we go to the whole system and our franchisees are  behind this nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so i think its worth emphasizing that this is very complicated very datadriven as you just suggested but we will probably end up as we always have had with different solutions for different parts of the country so there is not one size fits all chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc absolutely i mean were trying to become a much more simple brand but obviously there will be things that you could do in different parts of the country on a oneoff basis i think the reality is this is all about simplification of the menu simplification of everything else that we do in the restaurants as well will be part of the next wave john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc and maybe related to that and nigel in your prepared remarks you talked about like kind of like the next modern wave of dunkin stores having completely different design equipment and technology could you focus on the equipment and technology piece i mean even if youre just seeing distant prototypes or even in a warehouse somewhere how significant equipment and technology could be to transform both the throughput and the labor model at dunkin as it currently exists today nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so we have a very open mind on technology theres a lot of different formats that are being developed in the restaurant business were looking actively at all those and if we see something that works for dunkin we will integrate it i think weve already transformed our business significantly and we feel really proud of the fact that were this onthego brand i mean look at our drivethru numbers as dave referenced look at the success of onthego and that is â as ive said probably  times â the architecture for the future because i deliver it  so there is a lot of technology thats going to come in the opportunity for you guys to see it will happen i think fairly quickly im not going to promise anything yet but will happen fairly quickly and chris what else can you add to what i said chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc absolutely so if you think about menu simplification as the unlock for menu innovation and really making sure that were delivering a modern relevant menu for our guests in the future i think equipment and technology help us with the unparalleled convenience aspect that dave mentioned in his remarks so if you think about smart technology in some of our pieces of equipment and if you think about really extending on our ability to talk about grinding fresh and brewing fresh and the fact that we put a new cup of coffee out every  minutes to our guests unlike anybody else in the industry if you look at what we did with the sandwich station over the last couple years to make it easier to deliver throughput things around the drivethru and then onthego this is all about advancing technology across the entire enterprise so that we can make our guests happy when they come to the restaurants david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc and john its important that under that pillar of unparalleled convenience when we talk about being agnostic technology is going to play a critical role so that the customer can order the way they want pay the way they want and get the food the way they want that type of frictionless experience is whats going to be underpinned by all of the technology that nigel and chris just mentioned thanks john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator thank you our next question will come from the line of jeffrey bernstein with barclays please go ahead your line is now open jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc great thank you very much two questions as well first one just on the q us dunkin comp i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks and then the press release the traffic was negative seems like thats similar to the past couple of quarters but directionally nigel i thought you mentioned that it was â you were pleased with the improvement in the comps im just wondering if you can provide some color on the comp i just thought there was a comment that the traffic was actually slipped versus the first quarter yet the comp was stronger so any color in terms of the components of the comp maybe the regions of the comp where it was better or worse with the dayparts would be very helpful and then i had one followup david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc okay yes jeff on that just the opposite traffic was improved so it wasnt worse traffic was improved and in terms of check relative about the same in terms of the increase there so less negative on the traffic side and about on par with q on the check side jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc and in terms of region or daypart is there any area thats more challenged nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc no we dont break down by region or â what ill say on daypart and i think ive already commented on this on national tv so were really really pleased with the morning i mean we are excited about whats happening in the morning and dave and i everyday talk about how we can improve the pm so if i had to choose where id be really pleased id be pleased if the morning was doing well which is when youre an onthego brand like ours and led by beverages you want to be strong in the morning were strong in the morning breakfast continues to grow we do have some questions to ask about how we can stimulate the afternoon were trying innovation were using perks offers were using some selective discounting its not just national discounting its some regional so we really are tackling the afternoon but im delighted with the trends both in traffic and comps in the morning david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah and jeff as you know there is an industry issue with traffic declines and were not immune to that but every quarter were going to continue to make progress in this area and its a laser focus for us in terms of driving traffic in the business jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc understood and then just a followup on the dunkin us unit commentary nigel i mean i know you dont give  guidance this early on but more qualitatively if the franchisees are balancing their capex needs and i think you mentioned the new store model is really not going to be national until the second half of  and then theyre all doing remodels in the equipment and technology it would seem like its fair to assume that at least as we start  that this type of reduction is appropriate and likely to persist is there any reason why those investments would abate so quickly that  could see a reacceleration or are these investments presumably a little bit longer lasting and its the right thing to do in the short term nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so jeff that was a very sophisticated way to get me to comment on  which im not going to do what i will do though is to say that our franchisees have stores already in the pipeline for next year they have stores in the pipeline for  thats the same every year we have inyear stores a lot of those apods but sometimes in areas like new york philadelphia you can add inyear stores but the franchisees are making their decisions the franchisees sometimes decide they want to put stores ignoring the new image to block out a competitor or to add to their portfolio there is all kinds of reasons they do it but im not going to make any more commentary about what may happen in  jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc understood thank you operator thank you our next question will come from the line of andy barish with jefferies please go ahead your line is now open andrew marc barish  jefferies llc hey guys just on the unit development is â have you seen an increased level of cannibalization in core markets and is that factoring in or is it more just the strategic brand changes that you highlighted obviously this morning nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so andy you and i talked about this before cannibalization happens every single store you open thats a reality if youre a brand new brand and you open your second store youre cannibalizing the first so cannibalization happens all the time we decided long time ago not to call out cannibalization if we did we can probably add it to our accounts but we decided because were a development company were never going call it out so it happens in certain markets sometimes it deliberate franchisees sometimes had stores that they deliberately cannibalized their own stores to keep out competition or they hear a competition coming in so that happens all the time but were not going to break it down by region which is consistently what we do with the rest of our results andrew marc barish  jefferies llc okay and then one modeling question to get kate involved here obviously the unit development stuff is negative to the broader guide but youve kept the numbers intact i guess just trying to see what the offset is thats coming in a little bit more positive relative to the slower unit count numbers kate jaspon  dunkin brands group inc sure good question from time to time we offer our franchisees the option to renew their term on the remaining agreement i think we mentioned within the script to allow them to get back to  years of term assuming theyre uptodate with their remodel schedule so this year franchisees have exceeded our expectations yeartodate for renewals so thats driving it and then we have a line of sight into the additional renewals that we expect will come in the back half of the year so thats primarily the offset andrew marc barish  jefferies llc okay thank you kate jaspon  dunkin brands group inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question will come from gregory francfort with bank of america your line is open gregory r francfort  bank of america merrill lynch hey guys can you just talk about the readytodrink market sort of what youre seeing there and maybe do you think youre expanding that category or taking share from other major competitors and if so maybe who do you think youre taking share from sort of the higherend guys or who else david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah thanks greg you know what were really delighted with the partnership that we have with cocacola to get into this space we think its incredible white space for us and we did our launch early this year and very pleased you heard me talk about â we just broke through double digits on national share from the reporting that were getting back and coke is excited about the partnership along with the bottlers as well as we move forward in terms of what were seeing were expanding the category of course im sure there is going to be â were going to be taking sure as well but more broadly were expanding the category right now but were excited about our initial launch and were excited about the innovation that were going to be putting behind that as well going forward gregory r francfort  bank of america merrill lynch okay got it and maybe just one other just on the changes to the assets and the potential reimage that youre guys are doing can you talk about the drivethru and how that fits into it with mobile or inpay  do you think there is any need to change kind of the layout or set up of the drivethru going forward david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah thats one where were continue to tackle look weve got a strong drivethru presence i think you heard the say same as this before that  of our fleet of restaurants have drivethrus curbside is another avenue for us to get into that super convenient market but in that space when we talk about a frictionless experience inside we also mean that for the drivethru as well and so onthego ordering were looking at available ways that we might be able to make that even more advantageous for our onthego customers so that is all in play and youll see iterations of that as we start testing that and looking at things on how we can make that throughput even better and that proposition for the customer even better nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc great ill just add one thing in slightly broader were so excited about our drivethru performance in the us im really pushing hard to see how we can take drivethru into international we do have some international stores particularly in the saudi arabia with drivethru i think we could do more and im also intrigued by baskinrobbins where i think ill have to check the number but i think there were  stores of drivethrus and some of them have a very high percentage going through the drivethru i think jason with his leadership will understand how strong drivethru has been in dunkin and migrate at the baskin so i think this â unparallel convenience that dave talked about is the trend that we can apply elsewhere gregory r francfort  bank of america merrill lynch thanks thanks nigel operator thank you sir our next question comes from jason west with credit suisse please go ahead your line is now open jason west  credit suisse securities usa llc yeah thanks guys sorry to go back to the unit outlook again but obviously its pretty critical for the growth model here so can you talk a bit more about the decision to lower the guidance i mean you talked about the new prototype or design that you want to focus on for remodels and new units but it seems like there must be more to it in that in terms of why you would lower the number midyear here and is this decision coming more from the corporate office saying we think the system should slowdown or is this just adding up sort of the franchisee commitments and the numbers coming in a little bit lower than expected and any other pressures out there that are driving this whether its competition or real estate pickup and closures anymore color would be helpful thanks nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so good question so most of the things you put out there i can say no to the first thing is someone wrote this morning about is it unit economics no were actually delighted with our unit economics and weve done some internal comparisons which i wont go into in explicit detail today but we believe we are right up the league table of unit economics when you look at it in several ways particularly when you look at things like food paper labor which we call fpl here and were way up there compared with all kinds of other chains secondly its not corporate office mandate in corporate office works with the franchisees most franchisees as i said earlier plan well over a year in advance so you dont just suddenly knee jerk it i think every year we have instore deals some of them are apods and some of those stores we are not opening to be brutally honest appropriately they are  average weekly sales i mean there is a mix there so im far less concerned about the new i think ive given you the reasons which just to reiterate is about the new image coming along the franchisees where theyre going to invest their money in the future and i think probably the thing you said was as we look to that we decided that were always transparent with the street that wed just be transparent and say our guidance is coming down you never know right until the end of the year what the number is going to be some stores can be opening on the th of december moving to next year or stay in this year so with all that we decided to bring down guidance but none of the things like unit economics were a driver behind this jason west  credit suisse securities usa llc okay and any color on the regional change thats occurred i know you guys arent given the regional breakdown until year end now but in terms of the pull back on some of the units is it in more of the corn established i would assume or maybe not nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc yeah i think theres some pullback there but i think one number that i always get this number wrong so ill get dave to do it if i take california we are expecting this year to have over  growth in california is that right david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah  on the base will be new store growth so any boutique out there if you look to this youd say thats unbelievable but on our size and how were evaluated it doesnt show up yet as something that significant but again we are pursuing greater exposure out west weve talked to you about that extensively and id say as nigel pointed out and said earlier during his talking point say there is normal ebb and flows and as i saw it in my previous role as well and we are focused on quality and quality openings and again you heard nigel talked about first year sales and look there is a lot of excitement and im spending a lot of time out on the road with our franchisees and there is a lot of alignment unity behind not only this plan but what were doing around new growth and remodels going forward nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc yeah i took a look for later making us uptodate at some of our competitors and their openings and every time i look at it one change that got a lot fanfare earlier in the week closed  stores in the quarter look at our numbers look at our years numbers the only chain change has beaten us in the us is starbucks so were way up there so we feel actually very good about what weve continued to do and the great thing is franchisees feel good about their openings â the stores they are opening jason west  credit suisse securities usa llc thank you operator thank you sir our next question will come from david palmer with rbc capital markets your question please david palmer  rbc capital markets llc hi i got first a followup back there on the unit growth and particularly about the format in the regions i have a feeling that there is differences in the returns youre getting between california versus other and drivethru versus inline so for instance drivethrus in california maybe the answer but those dont get built over night with the zoning that must be out there the pipeline may take time to build for something like that and therefore the ramp could you talk a little bit more about these differences and how the development â this would affect the development the rate of development thanks david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yes david good morning as you point out look were late to california we have to be a little bit more ingenious on how we go after sites and get into the sites but thats the brilliance of our model drivethru is going to be core asset for us so thats one piece of this but we also think curbside also with our inline restaurants is also going to be an element of this that mirrors and very much resembles the returns that were seeing with drivethru so look on returns the returns out in california as nigel said upfront are great the operators are bullish and so were still very much forging ahead but were trying to give the franchisees more options and more avenues and more tools in their toolbox to be able to penetrate a market that is heavily penetrated and where were coming in from behind to make sure that we can get the great sites that are needed out there for longterm success david palmer  rbc capital markets llc and then also you had talked previously about doing more with advertised value perhaps nationally advertised value what have you done so far there its hard to tease out whats local versus national and is more of that to come than what weve seen so far thanks chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc thanks david this is chris so we have alignment with our franchisees on nationally advertised value every month for the rest of the year two for  wakeup wrap is a great example every restaurant in our system is offering that as a national promotion currently and youll see more of that to come in the months ahead david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc and david the other thing is when i came into the business here in january franchisees are aggressive had great regional programs but when you move as one voice nationally it puts you in a stronger position and so as i mentioned earlier the two for  wakeup wrap are the things the types of promotions that youre going to see the back half of the year and then into next year and were very pleased with this and the attachment that were getting with these type of offers so were very encouraged by the momentum but its a competitive marketplace out there nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so david i know value is very close to your heart since you and i have debated it many times but i think dave has done some fantastic things in his â was it nine months now david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah six months since taking over the business nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc six months since taking over the business two of them are the focus on drivethrus hes really added value hes a drivethru expert and secondly hes really made us think hard about national values so two great things hes brought to the company and i think you should take that as a trend for the future david palmer  rbc capital markets llc thank you operator thank you sir our next question will come from matt difrisco with guggenheim securities please go ahead your questions please matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc thank you very much i guess moving over to digital a little bit and changing the topic can you give us some detail and some metrics on what youre seeing as far as dd perks and the loyalty how much as a percentage of sales stems from that some of your peers have really only seen growth based off of their most loyal customers where there seems to be this stagnant business in from the guys who are nonloyalty based so if you could tell us maybe compare yearoveryear what youve progressed as far as your dd perks participation as a percent of overall sales in the quarter sherrill kaplan  dunkin donuts llc hi there this is sherrill kaplan we are pleased with the sequential growth however were not going to chat about it on this call today matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc can you tell us any sort of metrics on it how many members you have versus last year how much did they outcomp your nonperks customer sherrill kaplan  dunkin donuts llc so last quarter we added  members and we are pleased with that progress nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc yeah what we have now got is just about  million perks members obviously we feel good about it the reason we dont comment on it is we would comment every single quarter we tend to do it once a year in detail but perks continues to grow the comps continue to be â actually we have a debate internally the comps are very good we then look at outside data which tells us they are actually even better than we think so the bottom line is were really pleased with our perks numbers david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah as sherrill mentioned the  new acquisitions that we got we are really pleased with those numbers we continue to see us growing on that base this is going to be a great lever for us going forward of course theyre our most loyal guests as you mentioned about the performance of the nonperks members is one that we want to continue to expand this and bring people in but as soon as â when we bring people into loyalty and especially when we also bring them into the onthego ordering process the velocity and rate of how they use our brand continues to accelerate so this is going to be a critical lever for us as it is for many players in the industry and we think we have some of the very best consumer facing technology out in the marketplace and its just making sure that we get awareness and trial and so we will continue to push on our recruiting efforts going forward because its critical to our longterm success sherrill kaplan  dunkin donuts llc yeah one thing i would just add to that is onthego did see sequential growth and as we talked about before once people try onthego weve seen over a  retrial rate so once they try onthego mobile ordering they really stick so were thrilled about that and as dave mentioned were going to double down on awareness and acquisition into that platform nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so for the record for those matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc did you disclose  nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so for the record for those who heard me talk about it i finally got my wife onto onthego and she cant stop using it now so once you get people to try it thats a big breakthrough matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc what was onthego in this quarter versus â you said it sequentially improved from q sherrill kaplan  dunkin donuts llc yeah weve decided to just release it when weve hit some significant milestone so today we chose not to share the numbers matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc okay sherrill kaplan  dunkin donuts llc but were pleased about the growth matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc okay operator thank you sir we have a question from the line of david tarantino with rw baird please go ahead your line is open david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc hi good morning i have a question about the new image and design of the restaurant youre rolling out and i just wonder if you could talk about philosophically how youre thinking about the investment costs and whether this is an opportunity to streamline the design in a way that lowers the investment costs and increases the roic profile david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah dave its a great question were excited to have you see all of this at our investor day in february as well look our go to market strategy on cost is front and center not just in the designs but also in the equipment package and the size of the facility as well so this is all part of our return model its something that we work very closely with our franchise leadership to make sure that we get this right so i think there is a great opportunity for us to continue to streamline this and balance that with new technologies as well that come into this so there is a lot of cross currents there but making sure we have the right affordable model that we can scale is what we partner with our franchisees on so that we can deliver the best and something that we can get out in the marketplace as quickly as possible nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc i think its worth saying that the focus weve had in this call on drivethru is its something that will continue into our development of the new store because our guests are telling us they like to go through the drivethru i mean weve got one store that has both drivethru and front counter  of the revenue goes through the drivethru now that is an exception i dont want anyone to write that thats a trend but it does demonstrate that people want convenience and if you can get the convenience like that that does mean that we should be able to develop a smaller box david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc great thats helpful and nigel can you just clarify the comment you made about focusing the conversation on system sales growth rather than unit development nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc yeah david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc that would be helpful thanks nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so david im pulling up on the nations restaurant news that youll all probably go away and look up is the june  edition and it has the top  and its kind of interesting when you read through it and we took our board through it in our last meeting and we come out number three in terms of system growth some brands there it was an interesting exercise of asking people whos the number one which wont surprise you but its starbucks we are number three you can find out who number two were but systemwide growth really shows the quality that we are opening and i go back to my earlier comment will you as analysts and investors rather open a store doing lets say  a week or a store doing  a week the answer is  a week because you want to get that royalty so we are very focused on that in the future i think we can put more through our boxes as we just said so were very focused on that and i want to repeat as ive said many times were a development machine despite the fact we took down guidance and you put development together with comps that is a model that hardly anyone of us has thats what makes us different it is constant development and most other businesses can talk about comps they cant talk about development in the us the way we can stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc operator we probably have time for one more question operator okay our final question will come from the line of will slabaugh with stephens incorporated please go ahead your line is now open will slabaugh  stephens inc yeah thanks guys i had a question on the simplification initiatives as it relates to menu innovation it seems like menu innovation and new product introductions have been a primary reason that your comps have remained mostly positive here in the past couple of years so im curious how this strategy as it evolves might impacts your thoughts around future menu innovation and should we think about this just going maybe deeper into current platforms or is there still the potential to add platforms going forward david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yes we definitely see a potential to add platforms and as chris rightly pointed out and i said in my opening look simplification we think is the unlock for innovation that gets us to lean into that position of being beverageled on thego brand we are certainly going to be very focused on food like we had been in the past and donuts as well but we like the idea of going after multiple platforms under beverages and being that beverageled onthego brand but the sequencing of this has to be right and the first thing is we have to as we go through this simplification effort call some of the things and the complexities that have gotten into our restaurants and we feel like this is the responsible way to go after that but we brought in some new culinary talent into the organization as well im in the marketplace for a cmo candidate in addition to that and so were excited about the folks that were bringing in here to complement the great team that we have and to fill the pipeline on innovation going forward will slabaugh  stephens inc thank you operator thank you that will conclude our time for questions id like to turn the program back over to nigel for any additional or closing remarks nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc thank you very much so in closing i think its worth saying we have a beautiful business model looking at various numbers around the room not many brands can sit up here and talk about continuing to grow their margins over  as adjusted operating income margins weve got a model thats enabled us to deliver consistent results through the years as we talked about and i think key to this is the engagement of our franchisees thats very important at dunkin franchisees are fully committed to the brand and to daves vision for the future he has been true added value to our company im confident also that jason will bring a similar leadership and passion to baskinrobbins i think were doing all the right things for our future and were truly focused on the future of our company and the key today is making the customers central to everything we do in digital leadership convenience obviously cost controls is also something thats important currently we didnt talk about that but i think we exhibited great cost control in the quarter and then talking about costs and profitability franchisee profitability is absolutely critical in every part of our business and were really focused on that so i think when you put all those ingredients together that will enable us to continue to deliver strong growth into the next decade so with that thank you for listening and ill speak to you again soon operator thank you presenters ladies and

of distribution are traditional restaurants consisting of endcap inline and standalone restaurants many with drivethrus and gas and convenience locations in addition we have alternative points of distribution âapodsâ such as full or selfservice kiosks in offices hospitals colleges airports grocery stores wholesale clubs and other smallerfootprint properties we believe that dunkinâ donuts continues to have significant growth potential in the us given its strong brand awareness and variety of restaurant formats for fiscal year   the dunkinâ donuts franchise system generated us systemwide sales of  billion  which accounted for approximately  of our global systemwide sales and had  us points of distribution with more than  of our restaurants having drivethrus at period end

and frozen beverages baskinrobbins enjoys  aided brand awareness in the us and we believe the brand is known for its innovative flavors popular âbirthday clubâ program and ice cream flavor library of over  different offerings additionally our baskinrobbins us segment has experienced comparable store sales growth in each of the last six fiscal years we believe we can capitalize on the brandâs strengths and continue generating renewed excitement for the brand baskinrobbinsâ â flavorsâ offering consumers a different flavor for each day of the month is recognized by ice cream consumers nationwide for fiscal year   the baskinrobbins franchise system generated us systemwide sales of approximately  million  which accounted for approximately  of our global systemwide sales over the last ten fiscal years total baskinrobbins us points of distribution declined from  to  as of decemberÂ    international operations our international business is primarily conducted via joint ventures and country or territorial license arrangements with âmaster franchiseesâ who both operate and subfranchise the brand within their licensed areas increasingly in certain markets we are migrating to a model with multiple franchisees in one country including markets in the united kingdom germany china and mexico our international franchise system predominantly located across asia and the middle east generated systemwide sales of  billion for fiscal year   which represented approximately  of dunkinâ brandsâ global systemwide sales as of decemberÂ    dunkinâ donuts had  international points of distribution in  countries excluding the us which grew from  points of distribution as of december   and represented  million of international systemwide sales for fiscal year   as of decemberÂ    baskinrobbins had  international points of distribution in  countries excluding the us which grew from  points of distribution as of december   and represented approximately  billion of international systemwide sales for fiscal year   we believe that we have opportunities to continue to grow our dunkinâ donuts and baskinrobbins concepts internationally in new and existing markets through brand and menu differentiation overview of franchising franchising is a business arrangement whereby a service organization the franchisor grants an operator the franchisee a license to sell the franchisorâs products and services and use its system and trademarks in a given area with or without exclusivity in the context of the restaurant industry a franchisee pays the franchisor for its concept strategy marketing operating system training purchasing power and brand recognition franchisees are solely responsible for the daytoday operations in each franchised restaurant including but not limited to all labor and employment decisions such as hiring promoting discharging scheduling and setting wages benefits and all other terms of employment with respect to their employees franchisee relationships we seek to maximize the alignment of our interests with those of our franchisees for instance we do not derive additional income through serving as the supplier to our domestic franchisees in addition because the ability to execute our strategy is dependent upon the strength of our relationships with our franchisees we maintain a multitiered advisory council system to foster an active dialogue with franchisees the advisory council system provides feedback and input on all major brand initiatives and is a source of timely information on evolving consumer preferences which assists new product introductions and advertising campaigns unlike certain other qsr franchise systems we generally do not guarantee our franchiseesâ financing obligations from time to time at our discretion we may offer voluntary financing to existing franchisees for specific programs such as the purchase of specialized equipment we intend to continue our past practice of limiting our guarantee of financing for franchisees franchise agreement terms for each franchised restaurant in the us we enter into a franchise agreement covering a standard set of terms and conditions a prospective franchisee may elect to open either a singlebranded distribution point or a multibranded distribution point in addition and depending upon the market a franchisee may purchase the right to open a franchised restaurant at one or multiple locations via a store development agreement or âsdaâ when granting the right to operate a restaurant to a potential franchisee we will generally evaluate the potential franchiseeâs prior foodservice experience history in managing profit and loss operations financial history and available capital and financing we also evaluate potential new franchisees based on financial measures including liquid asset and net worth minimums for each brand    the typical franchise agreement in the us has a year term the majority of our franchisees have entered into prime leases with a thirdparty landlord the company is the lessee on certain land leases theÂ company leases the land and erects a building or improved leases lessor owns the land and building covering restaurants and other properties in addition the company has leased and subleased land and buildings to other franchisees when we sublease properties to franchisees the sublease generally follows the prime lease term our leases to franchisees are typically for an overall term of  years we help domestic franchisees select sites and develop restaurants that conform to the physical specifications of our typical restaurant each domestic franchisee is responsible for selecting a site but must obtain site approval from us based on accessibility visibility proximity to other restaurants and targeted demographic factors including population density and traffic patterns additionally the franchisee must also refurbish and remodel each restaurant periodically typically every five and ten years respectively we currently require each domestic franchiseeâs managing owner andor designated manager to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us including minimum periods of classroom and onthejob training we monitor quality and endeavor to ensure compliance with our standards for restaurant operations through restaurant visits in the us in addition a restaurant operation review is conducted throughout our domestic operations at least once per year to complement these procedures we use âguest satisfaction surveysâ in the us to assess customer satisfaction with restaurant operations such as product quality restaurant cleanliness and customer service store development agreements we grant domestic franchisees the right to open one or more restaurants within a specified geographic area pursuant to the terms of sdas an sda specifies the number of restaurants and the mix of the brands represented by such restaurants that a franchisee is obligated to open each sda also requires the franchisee to meet certain milestones in the development and opening of the restaurant and if the franchisee meets those obligations we agree during the term of such sda not to operate or franchise new restaurants in the designated geographic area covered by such sda in addition to an sda a franchisee signs a separate franchise agreement for each restaurant developed under such sda master franchise model and international arrangements master franchise arrangements are used on a limited basis domestically the baskinrobbins brand has one âterritoryâ franchise agreement for certain midwestern markets but more widely internationally for both the baskinrobbins brand and the dunkinâ donuts brand in addition international arrangements include joint venture agreements in south korea both brands australia baskinrobbins brand and japan baskinrobbins brand as well as single unit franchises such as in canada both brands we utilize a multifranchise system in certain markets including in the united kingdom germany china and mexico the company also had an interest in a joint venture in spain for the dunkinâ donuts brand which it sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  master franchise agreements are the most prevalent international relationships for both brands under these agreements the applicable brand grants the master franchisee the exclusive right to develop and operate a certain number of restaurants within a particular geographic area such as selected cities one or more provinces or an entire country pursuant to a development schedule that defines the number of restaurants that the master franchisee must open annually those development schedules customarily extend for five to ten years if the master franchisee fails to perform its obligations the exclusivity provision of the agreement terminates and additional franchise agreements may be put in place to develop restaurants the master franchisee is generally required to pay an upfront market development fee and an upfront initial franchise fee for each developed restaurant and for the dunkinâ donuts brand royalties for the baskinrobbins brand the master franchisee is typically required to purchase ice cream from baskinrobbins or an approved supplier in most countries the master franchisee is also required to spend a certain percentage of gross sales on advertising in such foreign country in order to promote the brand generally the master franchise agreement serves as the franchise agreement for the underlying restaurants operating pursuant to such model depending on the individual agreement we may permit the master franchisee to subfranchise within its territory within each of our master franchisee and joint venture organizations training facilities have been established by the master franchisee or joint venture based on our specifications from those training facilities the master franchisee or joint venture trains future staff members of the international restaurants our master franchisees and joint venture entities also periodically send their primary training managers to the us for recertification    franchise fees in the us once a franchisee is approved a restaurant site is approved and a franchise agreement is signed the franchisee will begin to develop the restaurant franchisees pay us an initial franchise fee for the right to operate a restaurant for one or more franchised brands the franchisee is required to pay all or part of the initial franchise fee upfront upon execution of the franchise agreement regardless of when the restaurant is actually opened initial franchise fees vary by brand type of development agreement and geographic area of development but generally range from  to  as shown in the table below restaurant type initialÂ franchise fee dunkinâ donuts singlebranded restaurant   baskinrobbins singlebranded restaurant   dunkinâ donutsbaskinrobbins multibranded restaurant    fees effective as of january   and excludes alternative points of distribution in addition to the payment of initial franchise fees our us dunkinâ donuts brand franchisees us baskinrobbins brand franchisees and our international dunkinâ donuts brand franchisees pay us royalties on a percentage of the gross sales made from each restaurant in the us the majority of our franchise agreement renewals and the vast majority of our new franchise agreements require our franchisees to pay us a royalty of  of gross sales during fiscal year   our effective royalty rate in the dunkinâ donuts us segment was approximately  and in the baskinrobbins us segment was approximately  the arrangements for dunkinâ donuts in the majority of our international markets require royalty payments to us of  of gross sales however many of our larger international partners including our south korean joint venture partner have agreements at a lower rate andor based on wholesale sales to restaurants resulting in an effective royalty rate in the dunkinâ donuts international segment in  of approximately  we typically collect royalty payments on a weekly basis from our domestic franchisees for the baskinrobbins brand in international markets we do not generally receive royalty payments from our franchisees instead we earn revenue from such franchisees as a result of our sale of ice cream products to them and in  our effective royalty rate in this segment was approximately  in certain instances we supplement and modify certain sdas and franchise agreements entered into pursuant to such sdas with certain incentives that may i reduce or eliminate the initial franchise fee associated with a franchise agreement ii reduce the royalties for a specified period of the term of the franchise agreements depending on the details related to each specific incentive program iii reimburse the franchisee for certain local marketing activities in excess of the minimum required and iv provide certain development incentives to qualify for any or all of these incentives the franchisee must meet certain requirements each of which are set forth in an addendum to the sda and the franchise agreement we believe these incentives will lead to accelerated development in our less mature markets franchisees in the us also pay advertising fees to the brandspecific advertising funds administered by us franchisees make weekly contributions generally  of gross sales to the advertising funds franchisees may elect to increase the contribution to support general brandbuilding efforts or specific initiatives the advertising funds for the us which received  million in contributions from franchisees in fiscal year   are almost exclusively franchiseefunded and cover all expenses related to marketing research and development innovation advertising and promotion including market research production advertising costs public relations and sales promotions we use no more than  of the advertising funds to cover the administrative expenses of the advertising funds and for other strategic initiatives designed to increase sales and to enhance the reputation of the brands as the administrator of the advertising funds we determine the content and placement of advertising which is done through print radio television online billboards sponsorships and other media all of which is sourced by agencies under certain circumstances franchisees are permitted to conduct their own local advertising but must obtain our prior approval of content and promotional plans other franchise related fees we lease and sublease properties to franchisees in the us and in canada generating net rental fees when the cost charged to the franchisee exceeds the cost charged to us for fiscal year   we generated  or  million of our total revenue from rental fees from franchisees and incurred related occupancy expenses of  million we also receive a license fee from dean foods co âdean foodsâ as part of an arrangement whereby dean foods manufactures and distributes ice cream and other frozen products to baskinrobbins franchisees in the us in connection with this agreement dunkinâ brands receives a fee based on net sales of covered products for fiscal year   we generated  or  million of our total revenue from license fees from dean foods    we distribute ice cream products to baskinrobbins franchisees who operate baskinrobbins restaurants located in certain foreign countries and receive revenue associated with those sales for fiscal year   we generated  or  million of our total revenue from the sale of ice cream products to franchisees primarily in certain foreign countries other revenue sources include online training fees licensing fees earned from the sale of kcupÂ® pods retail packaged coffee and other branded products net refranchising gains other onetime fees such as transfer fees and late fees for fiscal year   we generated  or  million of our total revenue from these other sources international operations our international business is organized by brand and by country andor region operations are primarily conducted through master franchise agreements with local operators in certain instances the master franchisee may have the right to subfranchise we utilize a multifranchise system in certain markets including the united kingdom germany china and mexico in addition we have a joint venture with a local publiclytraded company for the baskinrobbins brand in japan and joint ventures with local companies in australia for the baskinrobbins brand and in south korea for both the dunkinâ donuts and baskinrobbins brands the company also had an interest in a joint venture in spain for the dunkinâ donuts brand which it sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  by teaming with local operators we believe we are better able to adapt our concepts to local business practices and consumer preferences we have had an international presence since  when the first dunkinâ donuts restaurant opened in canada as of decemberÂ    there were  baskinrobbins restaurants in  countries outside the us and  dunkinâ donuts restaurants in  countries outside the us baskinrobbins points of distribution represent the majority of our international presence and accounted for approximately

sales for fiscal year   for fiscal year    billion of total systemwide sales were generated by restaurants located in international markets which represented approximately  of total systemwide sales

accounted for approximately  billion of the total  billion restaurant industry sales in the us for the twelve months ended decemberÂ    the us restaurant industry is generally categorized into segments by price point ranges the types of food and beverages offered and service available to consumers qsr is a restaurant format characterized by counter or drivethru ordering and limited or no table service qsrs generally seek to capitalize on consumer desires for quality and convenient food at economical prices our dunkinâ donuts brand competes in the qsr segment categories and subcategories that include coffee donuts muffins bagels and breakfast sandwiches in addition in the us our dunkinâ donuts brand has historically focused on the breakfast daypart which we define to include the portion of each day from  am until  am while according to crestÂ® data the compound annual growth rate for total qsr daypart visits in the us was  over the fiveyear period ended december   the compound annual growth rate for qsr visits in the us during the morning meal daypart was  over the same fiveyear period there can be no assurance that such growth rates will be sustained in the future for the twelve months ended december   there were sales of over  billion restaurant servings of coffee in the us  of which were attributable to the qsr segment according to crestÂ® data according to crestÂ® total coffee servings at qsr have grown at a  compound annual rate for the fiveyear period ending december   over the years our dunkinâ donuts brand has evolved into a predominantly coffeebased concept with approximately  of dunkinâ donutsâ us systemwide sales for fiscal year  generated from coffee and other beverages we believe qsrs including dunkinâ donuts are positioned to capture additional coffee market share through an increased focus on coffee offerings our baskinrobbins brand competes primarily in qsr segment categories and subcategories that include hardserve ice cream as well as those that include soft serve ice cream frozen yogurt shakes malts floats and cakes while both of our brands compete internationally approximately  of baskinrobbins restaurants are located outside of the us and represent the majority of our total international sales and points of distribution competition we compete primarily in the qsr segment of the restaurant industry and face significant competition from a wide variety of restaurants convenience stores and other outlets that provide consumers with coffee baked goods sandwiches and ice cream on an international national regional and local level we believe that we compete based on among other things product quality restaurant concept service convenience value perception and price our competition continues to intensify as competitors increase the breadth and depth of their product offerings particularly during the breakfast daypart and open new units although new competitors may emerge at any time due to the low barriers to entry our competitors include eleven burger king cold stone creamery cumberland farms dairy queen mcdonaldâs panera bread quick trip starbucks subway taco bell tim hortons wawa and wendyâs among others additionally we compete with qsrs specialty restaurants and other retail concepts for prime restaurant locations and qualified franchisees licensing we derive licensing revenue from agreements with dean foods for domestic ice cream sales with the jm smucker co âsmuckersâ for the sale of packaged coffee in certain retail outlets primarily grocery retail and with keurig green mountain inc âkgmâ and smuckers for sale of dunkinâ kcupÂ® pods in certain retail outlets primarily grocery retail as well as from other licensees

million dunkinâ kcupÂ® pods in grocery outlets since launch in may  with the introduction of dunkinâ kcupÂ® pods into grocery outlets more than  billion cups of dunkinâ donuts coffee were sold through grocery outlets during calendar year  in early  the company launched dunkinâ donuts branded readytodrink ârtdâ bottled iced coffee for sale in grocery convenience stores and mass merchandisers as well as inside dunkinâ donuts restaurants across the us through an agreement with the cocacola company    marketing we coordinate domestic advertising and marketing at the national and local levels through our administration of brand specific advertising funds the goals of our marketing strategy include driving comparable store sales and brand differentiation increasing our total coffee and beverage sales protecting and growing our morning daypart sales and growing our afternoon daypart sales generally our domestic franchisees contribute  of weekly gross retail sales to fund brand specific advertising funds the funds are used for various national and local advertising campaigns including print radio television online mobile loyalty billboards and sponsorships over the past ten years our us franchisees have invested approximately  billion on advertising to increase brand awareness and restaurant performance across both brands additionally we have various pricing strategies so that our products appeal to a broad range of customers in august  we launched the dunkinâ donuts mobile application for payment and gifting which built the foundation for onetoone marketing with our customers in january  we launched a new dd perksÂ® rewards loyalty program nationally which is fully integrated with the dunkinâ donuts mobile application and allows us to engage our customers in these onetoone marketing interactions in june  we continued to leverage digital technologies to drive customer loyalty and enhance the restaurant experience through the launch of onthego mobile ordering for our dd perksÂ® members which enables users to order ahead and speed to the front of the line in restaurants as of decemberÂ   our dd perksÂ® rewards loyalty program had over  million members the supply chain domestic we do not typically supply products to our domestic franchisees as a result with the exception of licensing fees paid by dean foods on domestic ice cream sales we do not typically derive revenues from product distribution our franchiseesâ suppliers include rich products corp dean foods the cocacola company and kgm in addition our franchiseesâ primary coffee roasters currently are new england tea  coffee co inc mother parkers tea  coffee inc sd coffee inc and massimo zanetti beverage usa inc and their primary donut mix suppliers currently are continental mills and pennant ingredients inc we periodically review our relationships with licensees and approved suppliers and evaluate whether those relationships continue to be on competitive or advantageous terms for us and our franchisees purchasing purchasing for the dunkinâ donuts brand is facilitated by national dcp llc the ândcpâ which is a delaware limited liability company operated as a cooperative owned by its franchisee members the ndcp is managed by a staff of supply chain professionals who report directly to the ndcpâs board of directors the ndcp has approximately  employees including executive leadership sourcing professionals warehouse staff and drivers the ndcp board of directors has eight voting franchisee members one ndcp nonvoting member and one independent nonvoting member in addition our chief financial officer is a voting member of the ndcp board the ndcp engages in purchasing warehousing and distribution of food and supplies on behalf of participating restaurants and some international markets the ndcp program provides franchisee members nationwide the benefits of scale while fostering consistent product quality across the dunkinâ donuts brand we do not control the ndcp and have only limited contractual rights associated with managing that franchiseeowned purchasing and distribution cooperative manufacturing of dunkin â donuts bakery goods centralized production is another element of our supply chain that is designed to support growth for the dunkinâ donuts brand centralized manufacturing locations âcmlsâ are franchiseeowned and operated facilities for the centralized production of donuts and bakery goods the cmls deliver freshly baked products to dunkinâ donuts restaurants on a daily basis and are designed to provide consistent quality products while simplifying restaurantlevel operations as of decemberÂ    there were  cmls of varying size and capacity in the us cmls are an important part of franchise economics and are supportive of profit building initiatives as well as protecting brand quality standards and consistency certain of our dunkinâ donuts brand restaurants produce donuts and bakery goods onsite rather than sourcing from cmls many of such restaurants known as full producers also supply other local dunkinâ donuts restaurants that do not have access to cmls in addition in newer markets dunkinâ donuts brand restaurants source donuts and bakery goods that are finished in restaurants we believe that this âjust baked on demandâ donut manufacturing platform enables the dunkinâ donuts brand to more efficiently expand its restaurant base in newer markets where franchisees may not have access to a cml baskinrobbins ice cream we outsource the manufacturing and distribution of ice cream products for the domestic baskinrobbins brand franchisees to dean foods which strengthens our relationships with franchisees and allows us to focus on our core franchising operations    international dunkin â donuts international dunkinâ donuts franchisees are responsible for sourcing their own supplies subject to compliance with our standards most also produce their own donuts following the dunkinâ donuts brandâs approved processes franchisees in some markets source donuts produced by a brand approved third party supplierÂ franchisees are permitted to source coffee from a number of coffee roasters approved by the brand including the ndcp as well as certain approved regional and local roasters in certain countries our international franchisees source virtually everything locally within their market while in others our international franchisees source most of their supplies from the ndcp where supplies are sourced locally we help identify and approve those suppliers in addition we assist our international franchisees in identifying regional and global suppliers with the goal of leveraging the purchasing volume for pricing and product continuity advantages baskinrobbins the baskinrobbins manufacturing network is comprised of  facilities none of which are owned or operated by us that supply our international markets with ice cream products we utilize facilities owned by dean foods to produce ice cream products which we purchase and distribute to many of our international markets certain international franchisees rely on thirdpartyowned facilities to supply ice cream products to them including facilities in ireland and canada the baskinrobbins brand restaurants in india and russia are supported by master franchiseeowned facilities in those respective countries while the restaurants in japan and south korea are supported by the joint ventureowned facilities located within each country research and development new product innovation is a critical component of our success we believe the development of successful new products for each brand attracts new customers increases comparable store sales and allows franchisees to expand into other dayparts new product research and development is located in a stateoftheart facility at our headquarters in canton massachusetts the facility includes a sensory lab a quality assurance lab and a demonstration test kitchen we rely on our internal culinary team which uses consumer research to develop and test new products operational support substantially all of our executive management finance marketing legal technology human resources and operations support functions are conducted from our global headquarters in canton massachusetts in the united states our franchise operations for both brands are organized into regions each of which is headed by a regional vice president and directors of operations supported by field personnel who interact directly with the franchisees our international businesses are organized by region and have dedicated marketing and restaurant operations support teams that work with our master licensees and joint venture partners to improve restaurant operations and restaurantlevel economics management of a franchise restaurant is the responsibility of the franchisee who is trained in our techniques and is responsible for ensuring that the daytoday operations of the restaurant are in compliance with our operating standards we have implemented a computerbased disaster recovery program to address the possibility that a natural or other form of disaster may impact the information technology systems located at our canton massachusetts headquarters regulatory matters domestic we and our franchisees are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses including various health sanitation fire and safety standards in some jurisdictions our

zoning health safety sanitation building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located franchiseeowned ndcp and cmls are licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal state and local governments we and our franchisees are also subject to the fair labor standards act and various other laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of foodservice personnel employed by franchisees are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage our franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission âftcâ and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises the ftcâs franchise rule and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document âfddâ containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the fdd with state authorities we are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on our experience and aggregate net worth substantive state laws that regulate the franchisorfranchisee relationship    exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisorfranchisee relationship the state laws often limit among other things the duration and scope of noncompetition provisions the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply we believe that the fdd for each of our dunkinâ donuts brand and our baskinrobbins brand together with any applicable state versions or supplements and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the ftc franchise rule and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises

properties we lease and sublease to our franchisees and any construction or improvements we make at those locations are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations including environmental zoning and land use requirements our properties are sometimes located in developed commercial or industrial areas and might previously have been occupied by more environmentally significant operations such as gasoline stations and dry cleaners environmental laws sometimes require owners or operators of contaminated property to remediate that property regardless of fault while we have been required to and are continuing to clean up contamination at a limited number of our locations we have no known material environmental liabilities employees as of decemberÂ    we employed

california of these employees  who are almost exclusively in marketing positions were paid by certain of our advertising funds none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe our relationships with our employees are healthy our franchisees are independent business owners so they and their employees are not included in our employee count intellectual property we own many

websites and should not be considered part of this document item a risk factors risks related to our business and industry our financial results are affected by the operating results of our franchisees we receive a substantial majority of our revenues in the form of royalties which are generally based on a percentage of gross sales at franchised restaurants rent and other fees from franchiseesÂ accordingly our financial results are to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchiseesÂ if sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees their financial results may deteriorate and our royalty rent and other revenues may decline and our accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase in addition if our franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements our royalty revenues may decrease which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business our franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the operations safety and health standards set forth in our agreements with themÂ however franchisees are independent third parties whom we do not control the franchisees own operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants and have sole control over all employee and other workforce decisions as a result the ultimate success and quality of any franchised restaurant rests with the franchisee if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards franchise fees paid to us and royalty income will be adversely affected and brand image and reputation could be harmed which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results although we believe we generally enjoy a positive working relationship with the vast majority of our franchisees active andor potential disputes with franchisees could damage our brand reputation andor our relationships with the broader franchisee group our success depends substantially on the value of our brands our success is dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands our customersâ connection to our brands and a positive relationship with our franchisees brand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in litigation some of these incidents may relate to the way we manage our relationship with our franchisees our growth strategies our development efforts in domestic and foreign markets or the ordinary course of our or our franchiseesâ business other incidents may arise from events that are or may be beyond our ability to control and may damage our brands such as actions taken or not taken by one or more franchisees or their employees relating to health safety welfare or otherwise litigation and claims security breaches or other fraudulent activities associated with our electronic payment systems and illegal activity targeted at us or others consumer demand for our products and our brandsâ value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us or our products which would likely result in lower sales and ultimately lower royalty income which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results incidents involving foodborne illnesses food tampering or food contamination involving our brands or our supply chain could create negative publicity and significantly harm our operating results while we and our franchisees dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to enable customers to enjoy safe quality food productsÂ food safetyÂ events including instances of foodborne illness such as salmonella or e coli have occurred in the food industry in the past and could occur in the future instances or reports whether true or not of foodsafetyÂ issues such as foodborne illnesses food tampering food contamination or mislabeling either during the growing manufacturing packaging storing or preparation of products have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the quickservice restaurant sectors and could affect us as well any report linking us our franchisees or our suppliers to foodborne illnesses or food tampering contamination mislabeling or    otherÂ foodsafetyÂ issues could damage the value of our brands immediately and severely hurt sales of our products and possibly lead to product liability claims litigation including class actions or other damages in additionÂ food safetyÂ incidents whether or not involving our brands could result in negative publicity for the industry or market segments in which we operate increased use of social media could create andor amplify the effects of negative publicity this negative publicity may reduce demand for our products and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types a decrease in traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could materially and adversely affect our brands our business and our stock price the quick service restaurant segment is highly competitive and competition could lower our revenues the qsr segment of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive the beverage and food products sold by our franchisees compete directly against products sold at other qsrs local and regional beverage and food operations specialty beverage and food retailers supermarkets and wholesale suppliers many bearing recognized brand names and having significant customer loyalty in addition to the prevailing baseline level of competition major market players in noncompeting industries may choose to enter the restaurant industry key competitive factors include the number and location of restaurants quality and speed of service attractiveness of facilities effectiveness of advertising marketing and operational programs price demographic patterns and trends consumer preferences and spending patterns menu diversification health or dietary preferences and perceptions and new product development some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us which may provide them with a competitive advantage in addition we compete within the restaurant industry and the qsr segment not only for customers but also for qualified franchisees we cannot guarantee the retention of any including the topperforming franchisees in the future or that we will maintain the ability to attract retain and motivate sufficient numbers of franchisees of the same caliber which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results if we are unable to maintain our competitive position we could experience lower demand for products downward pressure on prices the loss of market share and the inability to attract or loss of qualified franchisees which could result in lower franchise fees and royalty income and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results if we or our franchisees or licensees are unable to protect our customers â credit card data and other personal information we or our franchisees could be exposed to data loss litigation and liability and our reputation could be significantly harmed data protection is increasingly demanding and the use of electronic payment methods and collection of other personal information exposes us and our franchisees to increased risk of privacy andor security breaches as well as other risks in connection with credit card transactions instore and online we and our franchisees collect and transmit confidential credit card information by way of retail networks additionally we collect and store personal information from individuals including our customers franchisees and employees we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing such information the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems including through cyber terrorism could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results further the standards for systems currently used for transmission and approval of electronic payment transactions and the technology utilized in electronic payment themselves all of which can put electronic payment data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry not by us in addition our employees franchisees contractors or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to misappropriate such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information third parties may have the technology or knowhow to breach the security of the personal information collected stored or transmitted by us or our franchisees and our respective security measures as well as those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach if a person is able to circumvent our data security measures or that of third parties with whom we do business including our franchisees he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss litigation liability and could seriously disrupt our operations any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation and could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results subfranchisees could take actions that could harm our business and that of our master franchisees in certain of our international markets we enter into agreements with master franchisees that permit the master franchisee to develop and operate restaurants in defined geographic areas as permitted by our master franchisee agreements certain master franchisees elect to subfranchise rights to develop and operate restaurants in the geographic area covered by the master franchisee agreement our master franchisee agreements contractually obligate our master franchisees to operate their    restaurants in accordance with specified operations safety and health standards and also require that any subfranchise agreement contain similar requirements however we are not party to the agreements with the subfranchisees and as a result are dependent upon our master franchisees to enforce these standards with respect to subfranchised restaurants as a result the ultimate success and quality of any subfranchised restaurant rests with the master franchisee if subfranchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards franchise fees and royalty income paid to the applicable master franchisee and ultimately to us could be adversely affected and our brand image and reputation may be harmed which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results we cannot predict the impact that the following may have on our business iÂ new or improved technologies iiÂ alternative methods of delivery or iiiÂ changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these technologies and alternative methods of delivery advances in technologies or alternative methods of delivery including advances in vending machine technology and home coffee makers or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our businessÂ moreover technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and we expect that new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future we may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model however we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our businessÂ in addition our competitors some of whom have greater resources than us may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of alternative methods of delivery which could harm our competitive position there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences including with respect to new technologies and alternative methods of delivery or to effectively adjust our product mix service offerings and marketing and merchandising initiatives for products and services that address and anticipate advances in technology and market trendsÂ if we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges our business financial condition and operating results could be harmed economic conditions adversely affecting consumer discretionary spending may negatively impact our business and operating results we believe that our franchiseesâ sales customer traffic and profitability are strongly correlated to consumer discretionary spending which is influenced by general economic conditions unemployment levels and the availability of discretionary incomeÂ our franchiseesâ sales are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers any reduction in sales at franchised restaurants will result in lower royalty payments from franchisees to us and adversely impact our profitabilityÂ in an economic downturn our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affectedÂ in addition the pace of new restaurant openings may be slowed and restaurants may be forced to close reducing the restaurant base from which we derive royalty incomeÂ  our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of decemberÂ    we had total indebtedness of approximately  billion under our securitized debt facility excluding  million of undrawn letters of credit and  million of unused commitments subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our securitized debt facility we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance capital expenditures investments acquisitions or for other purposes if we do incur substantial additional debt the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences including â¢ limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures investments acquisitions or other general corporate requirements â¢ requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to payments to service our indebtedness instead of other purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures investments acquisitions and other general corporate purposes â¢ increasing our vulnerability to and the potential impact of adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions â¢ limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete â¢ placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and    â¢ increasing our costs of borrowingÂ  in addition the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments and engage in other transactions and the leverage may cause other potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the amounts projected or at all or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity investments if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all our business may be harmed the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt facility we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings the securitized debt facility under which certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding notes contain a number of covenants with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to among other things â¢ sell assets â¢ alter the business we conduct â¢ engage in mergers acquisitions and other business combinations â¢ declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock â¢ incur assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees â¢ make loans and investments â¢ incur liens and â¢ enter into transactions with affiliates the securitized debt facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not satisfy such a test a breach of these covenants could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt facility if amounts owed under the securitized debt facility are accelerated because of a default and we are unable to pay such amounts the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt facility prior to the expiration of the applicable term our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and other than management fees sufficient to cover minimal selling general and administrative expenses would not be available for operating our business no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing    the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events cash flow would be further restricted in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture including without limitation upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business infringement misappropriation or dilution of our intellectual property could harm our business we regard our dunkinâ donuts Â® and baskinrobbins Â® trademarks as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our brands we have also obtained trademark protection for the trademarks associated with several of our product offerings and advertising slogans including âamerica runs on dunkinâ Â® â we believe that these and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts as well as copyright patent trademark and other laws such as trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our intellectual property from infringement misappropriation or dilution we have registered certain trademarks and service marks and have other trademark and service mark registration applications pending in the united states and foreign jurisdictions however not all of the trademarks or service marks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and they may never be registered in all of those countries although we monitor trademark portfolios both internally and through external search agents and impose an obligation on franchisees to notify us upon learning of potential infringement there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately maintain enforce and protect our trademarks or other intellectual property rights we are aware of names and marks similar to our service marks being used by other persons although we believe such uses will not adversely affect us further or currently unknown unauthorized uses or other infringement of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and may adversely affect our business effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant or license our intellectual property failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could damage our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively even where we have effectively secured statutory protection for our trade secrets and other intellectual property our competitors may misappropriate our intellectual property and our employees consultants and suppliers may breach their contractual obligations not to reveal our confidential information including trade secrets although we have taken measures to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that third parties will not independently develop products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours despite our efforts it may be possible for thirdparties to reverse engineer otherwise obtain copy and use information that we regard as proprietary furthermore defending or enforcing our trademark rights branding practices and other intellectual property and seeking an injunction andor compensation for misappropriation of confidential information could result in the expenditure of significant resources and divert the attention of management which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results our brands may be limited or diluted through franchisee and thirdparty activity although we monitor and restrict franchisee activities through our franchise and license agreements franchisees or third parties may refer to or make statements about our brands that do not make proper use of our trademarks or required designations that improperly alter trademarks or branding or that are critical of our brands or place our brands in a context that may tarnish their reputation this may result in dilution or tarnishment of our intellectual property it is not possible for us to obtain registrations for all possible variations of our branding in all territories where we operate franchisees licensees or third parties may seek to register or obtain registration for domain names and trademarks involving localizations variations and versions of certain branding tools and these activities may limit our ability to obtain or use such rights in such territories franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise or license agreements may reduce the overall goodwill of our brands whether through the failure to meet health and safety standards engage in quality control or maintain product consistency or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices moreover unauthorized third parties may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our brands resulting in consumer confusion or dilution any reduction of our brandsâ goodwill consumer confusion or dilution is likely to impact sales and could materially and adversely impact our business and operating results we are and may become subject to thirdparty infringement claims or challenges to the validity of our intellectual property  we are and may in the future become the subject of claims for infringement misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights which may or not be unfounded from owners of intellectual property in areas where our franchisees operate or where we intend to conduct operations including in foreign jurisdictions such claims could harm our image our brands our competitive position or our ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions and cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement if such claims were decided against us or a third party indemnified by us pursuant to license terms we    could be required to pay damages develop or adopt non  infringing products or services or acquire a license to the intellectual property that is the subject of the asserted claim which license may not be available on acceptable terms or at all the attendant expenses could require the expenditure of additional capital and there would be expenses associated with the defense of any infringement misappropriation or other thirdparty claims and there could be attendant negative publicity even if ultimately decided in our favor growth into new territories may be hindered or blocked by preexisting thirdparty rights we act to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights we need to operate successfully in those territories where we operate certain intellectual property rights including rights in trademarks are national in character and are obtained on a countrybycountry basis by the first person to obtain protection through use or registration in that country in connection with specified products and services as our business grows we continuously evaluate the potential for expansion into new territories and new products and services there is a risk with each expansion that growth will be limited or unavailable due to blocking preexisting thirdparty intellectual property rights the restaurant industry is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products which could reduce sales by our franchisees and reduce our royalty revenues the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes national regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends for instance if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid donuts and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier our franchiseesâ sales would suffer resulting in lower royalty payments to us and our business and operating results would be harmed if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy which includes opening new domestic and international restaurants our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected our growth strategy relies in part upon new restaurant development by existing and new franchisees we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new restaurants including â¢ availability of financing â¢ selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations â¢ competition for restaurant sites â¢ negotiation of acceptable lease and financing terms â¢ securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals â¢ consumer tastes in new geographic regions and acceptance of our products â¢ employment and training of qualified personnel â¢ impact of inclement weather natural disasters and other acts of nature and â¢ general economic and business conditions in particular because the majority of our new restaurant development is funded by franchisee investment our growth strategy is dependent on our franchiseesâ or prospective franchiseesâ ability to access funds to finance such development we do not provide our franchisees with direct financing and therefore their ability to access borrowed funds generally depends on their independent relationships with various financial institutionsÂ if our franchisees or prospective franchisees are not able to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates or at all they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the development of new restaurants and our future growth could be adversely affected to the extent our franchisees are unable to open new restaurants as we anticipate our revenue growth would come primarily from growth in comparable store sales our failure to add a significant number of new restaurants or grow comparable store sales would adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and operating income and could materially and adversely harm our business and operating resultsÂ  increases in commodity prices may negatively affect payments from our franchisees and licensees coffee and other commodity prices are subject to substantial price fluctuations stemming from variations in weather patterns shifting political or economic conditions in coffeeproducing countries potential taxes or fees on certain imported goods and delays in the supply chain if commodity prices rise franchisees may experience reduced sales due to decreased consumer demand at retail prices that have been raised to offset increased commodity prices which may reduce franchisee profitability    any such decline in franchisee sales will reduce our royalty income which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results our joint ventures in japan and south korea as well as our licensees in russia and india manufacture ice cream products independently the joint ventures in japan and south korea each own a manufacturing facility in its country of operation the revenues derived from these joint ventures differ fundamentally from those of other types of franchise arrangements in the system because the income that we receive from the joint ventures in japan and south korea is based in part on the profitability rather than the gross sales of the restaurants operated by these joint ventures accordingly in the event that the joint ventures in japan or south korea experience staple ingredient price increases that adversely affect the profitability of the restaurants operated by these joint ventures that decrease in profitability would reduce distributions by these joint ventures to us which in turn could materially and adversely impact our business and operating results shortages of coffee or milk could adversely affect our revenues if coffee or milk consumption continues to increase worldwide or there is a disruption in the supply of coffee or milk due to natural disasters political unrest or other calamities the global supply of these commodities may fail to meet demand if coffee or milk demand is not met franchisees may experience reduced sales which in turn would reduce our royalty income additionally if milk demand is not met we may not be able to purchase and distribute ice cream products to our international franchisees which would reduce our sales of ice cream and other products such reductions in our royalty income and sales of ice cream and other products may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results we and our franchisees rely on information technology and computer systems to process transactions and manage our business and a disruption or a failure of such systems or technology could harm our ability to effectively manage our business network and information technology systems are integral to our business we utilize various computer systems including our fast system and our eftpay system which are customized webbased systems the fast system is the system by which our us and canadian franchisees report their weekly sales and pay their corresponding royalty fees and required advertising fund contributions when sales are reported by a us or canadian franchisee a withdrawal for the authorized amount is initiated from the franchiseeâs bank after Â days from the week ending or month ending date the fast system is critical to our ability to accurately track sales and compute royalties due from our us and canadian franchisees the eftpay system is used by our us and canadian franchisees to make payments against open nonfee invoices ie all invoices except royalty and advertising funds when a franchisee selects an invoice and submits the payment on the following day a withdrawal for the selected amount is initiated from the franchiseeâs bank additionally an increasing number of transactions in our restaurants are processed through our mobile application despite the implementation of security measures our systems are subject to damage andor interruption as a result of power outages computer and network failures computer viruses and other disruptive software security breaches terrorist attacks catastrophic events and improper usage by employees such events could result in a material disruption in operations a need for a costly repair upgrade or replacement of systems or a decrease in or in the collection of royalties paid to us by our franchisees to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we could incur liability which could materially affect our results of operations interruptions in the supply of product to franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our revenues in order to maintain qualitycontrol standards and consistency among restaurants we require through our franchise agreements that our franchisees obtain food and other supplies from preferred suppliers approved in advance in this regard we and our franchisees depend on a group of suppliers for ingredients foodstuffs beverages and disposable serving instruments including but not limited to rich products corp dean foods co the cocacola company and silver pail dairy ltd as well as four primary coffee roasters and two primary donut mix suppliers in  we and our franchisees purchased products from nearly  approved domestic suppliers with approximately  of such suppliers providing half based on dollar volume of all products purchased domestically we look to approve multiple suppliers for most products and require any single sourced supplier such as the cocacola company to have contingency plans in place to ensure continuity of supply in addition we believe that if necessary we could obtain readily available alternative sources of supply for each product that we currently source through a single supplier to facilitate the efficiency of our franchiseesâ supply chain we have historically entered into several preferredsupplier arrangements for particular food or beverage items the dunkinâ donuts system is supported domestically by the franchiseeowned purchasing and distribution cooperative known as the national distributor commitment program we have a longterm agreement with the national dcp llc the ândcpâ for the ndcp to provide substantially all of the goods needed to operate a dunkinâ donuts restaurant in the united states the ndcp also supplies some international markets the ndcp aggregates the franchisee demand sends requests for proposals to    approved suppliers and negotiates contracts for approved items the ndcp also inventories the items in its seven regional distribution centers and ships products to franchisees at least one time per week we do not control the ndcp and have only limited contractual rights under our agreement with the ndcp associated with supplier certification and quality assurance and protection of our intellectual property while the ndcp maintains contingency plans with its approved suppliers and has a contingency plan for its own distribution function to restaurants our franchisees bear risks associated with the timeliness solvency reputation labor relations freight costs price of raw materials and compliance with health and safety standards of each supplier including those of our international joint ventures including but not limited to risks associated with contamination to food and beverage products we have little control over such suppliers disruptions in these relationships may reduce franchisee sales and in turn our royalty income overall difficulty of suppliers including those of certain international joint ventures meeting franchisee product demand interruptions in the supply chain obstacles or delays in the process of renegotiating or renewing agreements with preferred suppliers financial difficulties experienced by suppliers or the deficiency lack or poor quality of alternative suppliers could adversely impact franchisee sales which in turn would reduce our royalty income and could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results we may not be able to recoup our expenditures on properties we sublease to franchisees in some locations we may pay more rent and other amounts to thirdparty landlords under a prime lease than we receive from the franchisee who subleases such property typically our franchiseesâ rent is based in part on a percentage of gross sales at the restaurant so a downturn in gross sales would negatively affect the level of the payments we receive additionally pursuant to the terms of certain prime leases we have entered into with thirdparty landlords we may be required to construct or improve a property pay taxes maintain insurance and comply with building codes and other applicable laws the subleases we enter into with franchisees related to such properties typically pass through such obligations but if a franchisee fails to perform the obligations passed through to them we will be required to perform those obligations resulting in an increase in our leasing and operational costs and expenses if the international markets in which we compete are affected by changes in political social legal economic or other factors our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected as of decemberÂ    we had  international restaurants located in  foreign countries the international operations of our franchisees may subject us to additional risks which differ in each country in which our franchisees operate and such risks may negatively affect our business or result in a delay in or loss of royalty income to us the factors impacting the international markets in which restaurants are located may include â¢ recessionary or expansive trends in international markets â¢ changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hyperinflation or deflation in the foreign countries in which we or our international joint ventures operate â¢ the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds â¢ availability of credit for our franchisees licensees and our international joint ventures to finance the development of new restaurants â¢ increases in the taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws â¢ legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of local operatorsâ compliance with a variety of laws including trade restrictions and tariffs â¢ interruption of the supply of product â¢ increases in antiamerican sentiment and the identification of the dunkinâ donuts brand and baskinrobbins brand as american brands â¢ political and economic instability and â¢ natural disasters terrorist threats andor activities and other calamities any or all of these factors may reduce distributions from our international joint ventures or other international partners andor royalty income which in turn may materially and adversely impact our business and operating results termination of an arrangement with a master franchisee could adversely impact our revenues internationally and in limited cases domestically we enter into relationships with âmaster franchiseesâ to develop and operate    restaurants in defined geographic areas master franchisees are granted exclusivity rights with respect to larger territories than the typical franchisees and in particular cases expansion after minimum requirements are met is subject to the discretion of the master franchisee in fiscal years   and  we derived approximately   and  respectively of our total revenues from master franchisee arrangements the termination of an arrangement with a master franchisee or a lack of expansion by certain master franchisees could result in the delay of the development of franchised restaurants or an interruption in the operation of one of our brands in a particular market or markets any such delay or interruption would result in a delay in or loss of royalty income to us whether by way of delayed royalty income or delayed revenues from the sale of ice cream and other products by us to franchisees internationally or reduced sales any interruption in operations due to the termination of an arrangement with a master franchisee similarly could result in lower revenues for us particularly if we were to determine to close restaurants following the termination of an arrangement with a master franchisee fluctuations in exchange rates affect our revenues we are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy most of our revenues costs and debts are denominated in us dollars however sales made by franchisees outside of the us are denominated in the currency of the country in which the point of distribution is located and this currency could become less valuable prior to calculation of our royalty payments in us dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as a result currency fluctuations could reduce our royalty income unfavorable currency fluctuations could result in a reduction in our revenues income we earn from our joint ventures is also subject to currency fluctuations these currency fluctuations affecting our revenues and costs could adversely affect our business and operating results adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products whether or not accurate could harm our brands and our business some of our products contain caffeine dairy products sugar other carbohydrates fats and other active compounds the health effects of which are the subject of increasing public scrutiny including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine dairy products sugar other carbohydrates fats and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects there has also been greater public awareness that sedentary lifestyles combined with excessive consumption of high carbohydrate highfat or highcalorie foods have led to a rapidly rising rate of obesity in the united states and certain other countries there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks including obesity as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products while we offer some healthier beverage and food items including reduced fat items and reduced sugar items an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks such as obesity could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could materially and adversely affect our brands and our business we may not be able to enforce payment of fees under certain of our franchise arrangements in certain limited instances a franchisee may be operating a restaurant pursuant to an unwritten franchise arrangement such circumstances may arise where a franchisee arrangement has expired and new or renewal agreements have yet to be executed or where the franchisee has developed and opened a restaurant but has failed to memorialize the franchisorfranchisee relationship in an executed agreement as of the opening date of such restaurant in certain other limited instances we may allow a franchisee in good standing to operate domestically pursuant to franchise arrangements which have expired in their normal course and have not yet been renewed as of decemberÂ    less than  of our restaurants were operating without a written agreement there is a risk that either category of these franchise arrangements may not be enforceable under federal state or local laws and regulations prior to correction or if left uncorrected in these instances the franchise arrangements may be enforceable on the basis of custom and assent of performance if the franchisee however were to neglect to remit royalty payments in a timely fashion we may be unable to enforce the payment of such fees which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results while we generally require franchise arrangements in foreign jurisdictions to be entered into pursuant to written franchise arrangements subject to certain exceptions some expired contracts letters of intent or oral agreements in existence may not be enforceable under local laws which could impair our ability to collect royalty income which in turn may materially and adversely impact our business and operating results our business activities subject us to litigation risk that could affect us adversely by subjecting us to significant money damages and other remedies or by increasing our litigation expense in the ordinary course of business we are the subject of complaints or litigation from franchisees usually related to alleged breaches of contract or wrongful termination under the franchise arrangements in addition we are from time to time the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging illness injury or other foodquality health or operational concerns and from suppliers alleging breach of contract we may also be subject to employee claims based on among other things    discrimination harassment or wrongful termination finally litigation against a franchisee or its affiliates by third parties whether in the ordinary course of business or otherwise may include claims against us by virtue of our relationship with the defendantfranchisee in addition to decreasing the ability of a defendantfranchisee to make royalty payments and diverting management resources adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially and adversely affect us and our brands regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable our international operations may be subject to additional risks related to litigation including difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations governed by foreign law due to differing interpretations of rights and obligations compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws new and potentially untested laws and judicial systems and reduced or diminished protection of intellectual property a substantial unsatisfied judgment against us or one of our subsidiaries could result in bankruptcy which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating resultsÂ  our business is subject to various laws and regulations and changes in such laws and regulations andor failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations could adversely affect us we are subject to state franchise registration requirements the rules and regulations of the federal trade commission the âftcâ various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises in the united states through the provision of franchise disclosure documents containing certain mandatory disclosures and certain rules and requirements regulating franchising arrangements in foreign countries although we believe that the franchisorsâ franchise disclosure documents together with any applicable statespecific versions or supplements and franchising procedures that we use comply in all material respects with both the ftc guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we offer new franchise arrangements noncompliance could reduce anticipated royalty income which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results our franchisees are subject to various existing us federal state local and foreign laws affecting the operation of the restaurants including various health sanitation fire and safety standards franchisees may in the future become subject to regulation or further regulation seeking to tax or regulate highfat foods to limit the serving size of beverages containing sugar to ban the use of certain packaging materials including polystyrene used in the iconic dunkinâ donuts cup or requiring the display of detailed nutrition information each of these regulations would be costly to comply with andor could result in reduced demand for our products in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain restaurants franchisees may be required to expend funds to meet us federal state and local and foreign regulations difficulties in obtaining or the failure to obtain required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area or cause an existing restaurant to cease operations all of these situations would decrease sales of an affected restaurant and reduce royalty payments to us with respect to such restaurant the franchisees are also subject to the fair labor standards act of  as amended and various other laws in the united states and in foreign countries governing such matters as minimumwage requirements overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements a significant number of our franchiseesâ foodservice employees are paid at rates related to the us federal minimum wage and applicable minimum wages in foreign jurisdictions and past increases in the us federal minimum wage and foreign jurisdiction minimum wage have increased labor costs as would future such increases any increases in labor costs might result in franchisees inadequately staffing restaurants understaffed restaurants could reduce sales at such restaurants decrease royalty payments and adversely affect our brands evolving labor and employment laws rules and regulations could also result in increased exposure on the part of dunkinâ brandsâ for labor and employment related liabilities that have historically been borne by franchisees our and our franchiseesâ operations and properties are subject to extensive us federal state and local laws and regulations including those relating to environmental building and zoning requirements our development of properties for leasing or subleasing to franchisees depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites which are subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations and requirements failure to comply with legal requirements could result in among other things revocation of required licenses administrative enforcement actions fines and civil and criminal liability we may incur investigation remediation or other costs related to releases of hazardous materials or other environmental conditions at our properties regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or a third party such as a prior owner or tenant we have incurred costs to address soil and groundwater contamination at some sites and continue to incur nominal remediation costs at some of our other locations if such issues become more expensive to address or if new issues arise they could increase our expenses generate negative publicity or otherwise adversely affect us we are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchisees our franchise system subjects us to a number of additional risks any one of which may impact our ability to collect royalty payments from our franchisees may harm the goodwill associated with our brands andor may materially and adversely impact    our business and results of operations bankruptcy of us franchisees a franchisee bankruptcy could have a substantial negative impact on our ability to collect payments due under such franchiseeâs franchise arrangements and to the extent such franchisee is a lessee pursuant to a franchisee leasesublease with us payments due under such franchisee leasesublease in a franchisee bankruptcy the bankruptcy trustee may reject its franchise arrangements andor franchisee leasesublease pursuant to sectionÂ  under the united states bankruptcy code in which case there would be no further royalty payments andor franchisee leasesublease payments from such franchisee and there can be no assurance as to the proceeds if any that may ultimately be recovered in a bankruptcy proceeding of such franchisee in connection with a damage claim resulting from such rejection franchisee changes in control the franchise arrangements prohibit âchanges in controlâ of a franchisee without our consent as the franchisor except in the event of the death or disability of a franchisee if a natural person or a principal of a franchisee entity in such event the executors and representatives of the franchisee are required to transfer the relevant franchise arrangements to a successor franchisee approved by the franchisor there can be however no assurance that any such successor would be found or if found would be able to perform the former franchiseeâs obligations under such franchise arrangements or successfully operate the restaurant if a successor franchisee is not found or if the successor franchisee that is found is not as successful in operating the restaurant as the thendeceased or disabled franchisee or franchisee principal the sales of the restaurant could be adversely affected franchisee insurance the franchise arrangements require each franchisee to maintain certain insurance types and levels certain extraordinary hazards however may not be covered and insurance may not be available or may be available only at prohibitively expensive rates with respect to many other risks moreover any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to franchisees may not be made on a timely basis any such loss or delay in payment could have a material and adverse effect on a franchiseeâs ability to satisfy its obligations under its franchise arrangement including its ability to make royalty payments some of our franchisees are operating entities franchisees may be natural persons or legal entities our franchisees that are operating companies as opposed to limited purpose entities are subject to business credit financial and other risks which may be unrelated to the operations of the restaurants these unrelated risks could materially and adversely affect a franchisee that is an operating company and its ability to make its royalty payments in full or on a timely basis which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results franchise arrangement termination nonrenewal each franchise arrangement is subject to termination by us as the franchisor in the event of a default generally after expiration of applicable cure periods although under certain circumstances a franchise arrangement may be terminated by us upon notice without an opportunity to cure the default provisions under the franchise arrangements are drafted broadly and include among other things any failure to meet operating standards and actions that may threaten our licensed intellectual property in addition each franchise agreement has an expiration date upon the expiration of the franchise arrangement we or the franchisee may or may not elect to renew the franchise arrangements if the franchisee arrangement is renewed the franchisee will receive a âsuccessorâ franchise arrangement for an additional term such option however is contingent on the franchiseeâs execution of the thencurrent form of franchise arrangements which may include increased royalty payments advertising fees and other costs the satisfaction of certain conditions including modernization of the restaurant and related operations and the payment of a renewal fee if a franchisee is unable or unwilling to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions the expiring franchise arrangements will terminate upon expiration of the term of the franchise arrangements product liability exposure we require franchisees to maintain general liability insurance coverage to protect against the risk of product liability and other risks and demand strict franchisee compliance with health and safety regulations however franchisees may receive through the supply chain from central manufacturing locations âcmlsâ ndcp or otherwise or produce defective food or beverage products which may adversely impact our brandsâ goodwill americans with disabilities act restaurants located in the united states must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of  as amended the âadaâ although we believe newer restaurants meet the ada construction standards and further that franchisees have historically been diligent in the remodeling of older restaurants a finding of noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of a franchisee to make royalty payments or could generate negative publicity or otherwise adversely affect us franchisee litigation franchisees are subject to a variety of litigation risks including but not limited to customer claims personalinjury claims environmental claims employee allegations of improper termination and discrimination claims related to violations of the ada religious freedom the fair labor standards act the employee retirement income security act of  as amended âerisaâ and intellectualproperty claims each of these claims may increase costs and limit the funds    available to make royalty payments and reduce the execution of new franchise arrangements potential conflicts with franchisee organizations  although we believe our relationship with our franchisees is open and strong the nature of the franchisorfranchisee relationship can give rise to conflict in the us our approach is collaborative in that we have established district advisory councils regional advisory councils and a national brand advisory council for each of the dunkinâ donuts brand and the baskinrobbins brand the councils are comprised of franchisees brand employees and executives and they meet to discuss the strengths weaknesses challenges and opportunities facing the brands as well as the rollout of new products and projects internationally our operations are primarily conducted through joint ventures with local licensees so our relationships are conducted directly with our licensees rather than separate advisory committees no material disputes with franchisee organizations exist in the united states or internationally at this time failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our executive management team and the ability of other key management personnel to replace executives who retire or resign we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management personnel to replace executives who retire or resign failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important personnel could lead to ineffective management and operations which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results unforeseen weather or other events including terrorist threats or activities may disrupt our business unforeseen events including war terrorism and other international regional or local instability or conflicts including labor issues embargos public health issues including tainted food foodborne illnesses food tampering or water supply or widespreadpandemic illness such as ebola the avian or hn flu mers and natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis hurricanes or other adverse weather and climate conditions whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations or that of our franchisees or suppliers or result in political or economic instability these events could reduce traffic in our restaurants and demand for our products make it difficult or impossible for our franchisees to receive products from their suppliers disrupt or prevent our ability to perform functions at the corporate level andor otherwise impede our or our franchiseesâ ability to continue business operations in a continuous manner consistent with the level and extent of business activities prior to the occurrence of the unexpected event or events which in turn may materially and adversely impact our business and operating results risks related to our common stock our stock price could be extremely volatile and as a result you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them since our initial public offering in july  the price of our common stock as reported by nasdaq has ranged from a low of  on decemberÂ   to a high of  on july   in addition the stock market in general has been highly volatile as a result the market price of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease which could be substantial in the value of their stock including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects and could lose part or all of their investment the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors including those described elsewhere in this report and others such as â¢ variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors â¢ actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results â¢ publication of research reports by securities analysts about us our competitors or our industry â¢ our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analystsâ projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market â¢ additions and departures of key personnel â¢ strategic decisions by us or our competitors such as acquisitions divestitures spinoffs joint ventures strategic investments or changes in business strategy â¢ the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry â¢ speculation in the press or investment community    â¢ changes in accounting principles â¢ terrorist acts acts of war or periods of widespread civil unrest â¢ natural disasters and other calamities and â¢ changes in general market and economic conditions as we operate in a single industry we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry our products or to a lesser extent our markets in the past securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managementâs attention and resources and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may deter takeover efforts that you feel would be beneficial to stockholder value our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions which could make it harder for a third party to acquire us even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include a classified board of directors and limitations on actions by our stockholders in addition our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval that could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer our certificate of incorporation also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and a holder of  or more of our outstanding common stock as a result you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of the company may be

and cash flow in future years the following is a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies revenue recognition initial franchise fee revenue is recognized upon substantial completion of the services required of us as stated in the franchise agreement which is generally upon opening of the respective restaurant fees collected in advance are deferred until earned royalty income is based on a percentage of franchisee gross sales and is recognized when earned which occurs at the franchiseesâ point of sale renewal fees are recognized when a renewal agreement with a franchisee becomes effective rental income for base rentals is recorded on a straightline basis over the lease term contingent rent is recognized as earned and any amounts received from lessees in advance of achieving stipulated thresholds are deferred until such threshold is actually achieved revenue from the sale of ice cream is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the buyer which is generally upon delivery licensing fees are recognized when earned which is generally upon sale of the underlying products by the licensees retail store revenues at companyoperated restaurants are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale net of sales tax and other salesrelated taxes gains on the refranchise or sale of a restaurant are recognized when the sale transaction closes the franchisee has a minimum amount of the purchase price in at risk equity and we are satisfied that the buyer can meet its financial obligations to us our revenue recognition policies will be impacted by new guidance for revenue recognition beginning in fiscal year  see ârecently issued accounting standardsâ below for further discussion impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and trade names âindefinitelived intangiblesâ have been assigned to our reporting units which are also our operating segments for purposes of impairment testing all of our reporting units have indefinitelived intangibles associated with them we evaluate the remaining useful life of our trade names to determine whether current events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life in addition all of our indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a trade name is impaired in the event we were to determine that the carrying value of a trade name would more likely than not exceed its fair value quantitative testing would be performed quantitative testing consists of a comparison of the fair value of each trade name with its carrying value with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recognized as an impairment loss for goodwill we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount in the event we were to determine that a reporting unitâs carrying value would more likely than not exceed its fair value quantitative testing would be performed which consists of a comparison of each reporting unitâs fair value to its carrying value the fair value of a reporting unit is an estimate of the amount for which the unit as a whole could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is written down to its implied fair value we have selected the firstÂ day of our fiscal third quarter as the date on which to perform our annual impairment test for all indefinitelived intangible assets we also test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of such indefinitelived intangibles has been impaired we determined the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill balances were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the most recent goodwill testing date no impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets was recorded during fiscal years     or   we have intangible assets other than goodwill and trade names that are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives or terms of their related agreements other intangible assets consist primarily of franchise and international license rights âfranchise rightsâ ice cream distribution and territorial franchise agreement license rights âlicense rightsâ and operating lease interests acquired related to our prime leases and subleases âoperating leases acquiredâ franchise rights license rights and operating leases acquired recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were valued using an appropriate valuation method during the period of acquisition amortization of franchise rights license rights and favorable operating leases acquired is recorded as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations and amortized over the    respective franchise license and lease terms using the straightline method unfavorable operating leases acquired related to our prime leases and subleases are recorded in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized into rental expense and rental income respectively over the base lease term of the respective leases using the straightline method our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value which is based on discounted cash flows income taxes our major tax jurisdictions subject to income tax are the us and canada the majority of our us legal entities are limited liability companies âllcsâ which are single member entities that are treated as disregarded entities and included as part of dbgi in a consolidated federal income tax return we also have subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions that file separate tax returns in their respective countries and local jurisdictions as required additionally we have a foreign subsidiary located in dubai within the united arab emirates for which no income tax return is required to be filed the current income tax liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries are calculated on a standalone basis the current federal tax liability for each entity included in our consolidated federal income tax return is calculated on a standalone basis including foreign taxes for which a separate company foreign tax credit is calculated in lieu of a deduction for foreign withholding taxes paid as a matter of course we are regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future tax consequences of items that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse the effects of changes in tax rate and changes in apportionment of income between tax jurisdictions on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the year in which the law is enacted or change in apportionment occurs valuation allowances are provided when we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of identified tax assets a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement estimates of interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in the provision for income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment legal contingencies we are engaged in litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business as a franchisor such matters typically include disputes related to compliance with the terms of franchise and development agreements including claims or threats of claims of breach of contract negligence and other alleged violations by us we record reserves for legal contingencies when information available to us indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated predicting the outcomes of claims and litigation and estimating the related costs and exposures involve substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates legal costs incurred in connection with legal and other contingencies are expensed as the costs are incurred allowances for franchise license and lease receivables we reserve all or a portion of a franchiseeâs receivable balance when deemed necessary based upon detailed review of such balances and apply a predefined reserve percentage based on an aging criteria to other balances we perform our reserve analysis during each fiscal quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that we may not collect the balance due while we use the best information available in making our determination the ultimate recovery of recorded receivables is also dependent upon future economic events and other conditions that may be beyond our control impairment of equity method investments we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that may have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of the investment if a loss in value has occurred and is deemed to be other    than temporary an impairment loss is recorded we review several factors to determine whether a loss has occurred that is other than temporary including absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment the length and extent of the fair value decline and the financial condition and future prospects of the investee recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board the âfasbâ issued new guidance for goodwill impairment which requires only a singlestep quantitative test to identify and measure impairment and record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unitâs carrying amount over its fair value the option to perform a qualitative assessment first for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary does not change under the new guidance this guidance is effective for us beginning in fiscal year  with early adoption permitted we expect to adopt this guidance in fiscal year  the adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements in november  the fasb issued new guidance addressing diversity in practice that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash in the statements of cash flows this guidance is effective for us beginning in fiscal year  with early adoption permitted we expect to adopt this guidance retrospectively beginning in fiscal year  upon adoption restricted cash will be combined with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows and the current presentation of changes in restricted cash within operating and financing activities will be eliminated upon adoption of this guidance net cash provided by operating activities will be reduced by  million and will increase by  million for fiscal years  and  respectively and net cash used in financing activities will increase by  thousand and will be reduced by  million for fiscal years  and  respectively the adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets in march  the fasb issued new guidance for employee sharebased compensation which simplifies several aspects of accounting for sharebased payment transactions including excess tax benefits forfeiture estimates statutory tax withholding requirements and classification in the statements of cash flows this guidance is effective for us in fiscal year  with early adoption permitted we expect to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year  upon adoption any future excess tax benefits or deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations instead of additional paidin capital in the consolidated balance sheets additionally excess tax benefits will be presented retrospectively as an operating cash inflow instead of a financing cash inflow in the statements of cash flows during fiscal years   and   million  millionÂ andÂ  million respectively of excess tax benefits were recorded to additional paidin capital that would have been recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes and such amounts would have been classified as operating cash inflows instead of financing cash inflows in the consolidated statements of cash flows if this new guidance had been adopted as of the respective dates in february  the fasb issued new guidance for lease accounting which replaces existing lease accounting guidance the new guidance aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements this guidance is effective for us in fiscal year  with early adoption permitted and modified retrospective application is required we expect to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year  and are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures we expect that substantially all of our operating lease commitments see note  to our consolidated financial statements included herein will be subject to the new guidance and will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets upon adoption in may  the fasb issued new guidance for revenue recognition related to contracts with customers except for contracts within the scope of other standards which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance the new guidance provides a single framework in which revenue is required to be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new guidance is effective for us in fiscal year  with early adoption permitted in fiscal year  we expect to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year  using the full retrospective transition method which will result in restating each prior reporting period presented in the year of adoption we expect the adoption of the new guidance to change the timing of recognition of initial franchise fees including master license and territory fees for our international business and renewal fees currently these fees are generally recognized upfront upon either opening of the respective restaurant or when a renewal agreement becomes effective the new guidance will generally require these fees to be recognized over the term of the related franchise license for the respective restaurant which we expect will result in a material impact to revenue recognized for franchise fees and renewal fees we do not expect this new guidance to materially impact the recognition of royalty income rental income or sales of ice cream and other products we are continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on these and other revenue transactions as well as the presentation of advertising fund revenues and expenses in addition to the impact on accounting policies and related disclosures    item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy most of our revenues costs and debts are denominated in us dollars however royalty income from our international franchisees is payable in us dollars and is generally based on a percentage of franchisee gross sales denominated in the foreign currency of the country in which the point of distribution is located and is therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuations additionally our investments in and equity income from joint ventures are denominated in foreign currencies and are therefore also subject to foreign currency fluctuations for fiscal year   a  change in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar would have had an approximately  million impact on international royalty income and an approximately  million impact on equity in net income of joint ventures additionally a  change in foreign currencies as of decemberÂ   would have had a  million impact on the carrying value of our investments in joint ventures in the future we may consider the use of derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks    item  financial

statements the company previously held a  interest in a limited partnership that owned and operated dunkinâ donuts restaurants in the dallas texas area the company possessed control of this entity and therefore consolidated the results of the limited partnership the partnership agreement contained a redemption feature that was probable to become redeemable in the future and this interest was therefore classified as temporary equity between liabilities and stockholdersâ deficit in the consolidated balance sheets the net loss and comprehensive loss attributable to the noncontrolling

liabilities are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation technique into a threelevel fair value hierarchy the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and lowest priority to unobservable inputs observable market data when available is required to be used in making fair value measurements when inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement    financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of decemberÂ   and decemberÂ   are summarized as follows inÂ thousands Â  Â  december   Â  december

products sold to certain international markets that are intransit from our thirdparty manufacturer to our international licensees during which time we hold title to such products the majority of ice cream products are purchased from one supplierÂ inventories are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value and cost is generally determined based on the actual cost of the specific inventory sold inventories are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets g assets held for sale assets held for sale primarily represent costs incurred by the company for store equipment and leasehold improvements constructed for sale to franchisees as well as restaurants formerly operated by franchisees or the company waiting to be resold the value of such restaurants and related assets is reduced to reflect net recoverable values with such reductions recorded to general and administrative expenses net in the consolidated statements of operations generally internal specialists estimate the amount to be recovered from the sale of such assets based on their knowledge of the aÂ market in which the store is located bÂ results of the companyâs previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and cÂ current economic conditions the actual cost of such assets held for sale is affected by specific factors such as the nature age location and condition of the assets as well as the economic environment and inflation we classify restaurants and their related assets as held for sale and suspend depreciation and amortization when aÂ we make a decision to refranchise or sell the property bÂ the stores are available for immediate sale cÂ we have begun an active program to locate a buyer dÂ significant changes to the plan of sale are not likely and eÂ the sale is probable within oneÂ year assets held for sale are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets    as of decemberÂ

method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term of the related asset estimated useful lives are as follows Â  years buildings Â âÂ  leasehold improvements Â âÂ  store production and other equipment Â âÂ  software Â âÂ  routine maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred major improvements additions or replacements that extend the life increase capacity or improve the safety or the efficiency of property are capitalized at cost and depreciated major improvements to leased property are capitalized as leasehold improvements and depreciated interest costs incurred during the acquisition period of capital assets are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset and depreciated i leases when determining lease terms we begin with the point at which the company obtains control and possession of the leased properties we include option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on the company in such an amount that the renewal appears at the inception of the lease to be reasonably assured which generally includes option periods through the end of the related franchise agreement term we also include any rent holidays in the determination of the lease term we record rent expense and rent income for leases and subleases respectively that contain scheduled rent increases on a straightline basis over the lease term as defined above in certain cases contingent rentals are based on sales levels of our franchisees in excess of stipulated amounts contingent rentals are included in rent income and rent expense as they are earned or accrued respectively we occasionally provide to our sublessees or receive from our landlords tenant improvement dollars tenant improvement dollars paid to our sublessees are recorded as a deferred rent asset for fixed asset andor leasehold purchases for which we receive tenant improvement dollars from our landlords we record the property and equipment andor leasehold improvements gross and establish a deferred rent obligation the deferred lease assets and obligations are amortized on a straightline basis over the determined sublease and lease terms respectively management regularly reviews sublease arrangements where we are the lessor for losses on sublease arrangements we recognize a loss discounted using creditadjusted riskfree rates when costs expected to be incurred under an operating prime lease exceed the anticipated future revenue stream of the operating sublease furthermore for properties where we do not currently have an operational franchise or other thirdparty sublessee and are under longterm lease agreements the present value of any remaining liability under the lease discounted using creditadjusted riskfree rates and net of estimated sublease recovery is recognized as a liability and recorded as an operating expense at the time we cease use of the property the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is assessed for potential impairment seeÂ noteÂ j j impairment of longlived assets longlived assets that are used in operations are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows recognition and measurement of a potential impairment is performed on assets grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level where identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities an impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of a longlived asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value fair value is generally estimated by internal specialists based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows or if required with the assistance of independent thirdparty valuation specialists depending on the nature of the assets or asset group    k equity method investments the companyâs equity method investments consist of interests in brÂ  ice cream co ltd âjapan jvâ brkorea co

coffee alliance sl âspain jvâ in accordance with the equity method which interest was sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  see note  the company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that may have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of the investment if a loss in value has occurred and is deemed to be other than temporary an impairment loss is recorded several factors are reviewed to determine whether a loss has occurred that is other than temporary including absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment the length and extent of the fair value decline and the financial condition and future prospects of the investee l goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and trade names âindefinitelived intangiblesâ have been assigned to our reporting units which are also our operating segments for purposes of impairment testing all of our reporting units have indefinitelived intangibles associated with them we evaluate the remaining useful life of our trade names to determine whether current events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life in addition all of our indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a trade name is impaired in the event we were to determine that the carrying value of a trade name would more likely than not exceed its fair value quantitative testing would be performed which consists of a comparison of the fair value of each trade name with its carrying value with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recognized as an impairment loss for goodwill we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount in the event we were to determine that a reporting unitâs carrying value would more likely than not exceed its fair value quantitative testing would be performed which consists of a comparison of each reporting unitâs fair value to its carrying value the fair value of a reporting unit is an estimate of the amount for which the unit as a whole could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is written down to its implied fair value we have selected the firstÂ day of our fiscal third quarter as the date on which to perform our annual impairment test for all indefinitelived intangible assets we also test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of such indefinitelived intangibles has been impaired other intangible assets consist primarily of franchise and international license rights âfranchise rightsâ ice cream distribution and territorial franchise agreement license rights âlicense rightsâ and operating lease interests acquired related to our prime leases and subleases âoperating leases acquiredâ franchise rights license rights and operating leases acquired recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were valued using an appropriate valuation method during the period of acquisition amortization of franchise rights license rights and favorable operating leases acquired is recorded as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations and amortized over the respective franchise license and lease terms using the straightline method unfavorable operating leases acquired related to our prime and subleases are recorded in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized into rental expense and rental income respectively over the base lease term of the respective leases using the straightline method the weighted average amortization period for all unfavorable operating leases acquired is  years management makes adjustments to the carrying amount of such intangible assets and unfavorable operating leases acquired if they are deemed to be impaired using the methodology for longlived assets see noteÂ j or when such license or lease agreements are reduced or terminated m contingencies the company records reserves for legal and other contingencies when information available to the company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated predicting the outcomes of claims and litigation and estimating the related costs and exposures involve substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates legal costs incurred in connection with legal and other contingencies are expensed as the costs are incurred    n foreign currency translation we translate assets and liabilities of nonusÂ operations into usÂ dollars at rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive loss and stockholdersâ deficit net of deferred taxes foreign currency translation adjustments primarily result from our equity method investments as well as subsidiaries located in canada the uk australia and other foreign jurisdictions transactions resulting in foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations o revenue recognition franchise fees and royalty income domestically the company sells individual franchises as well as territory agreements in the form of store development agreements âsdasâ that grant the right to develop restaurants in designated areas our franchise agreements and sdas typically require the franchisee to pay an initial nonrefundable fee and continuing fees or royalty income based upon a percentage of sales the franchisee will typically pay us a renewal fee if we approve a renewal of the franchise agreement such fees are paid by franchisees to obtain the rights associated with these franchise agreements or sdas initial franchise fee revenue is recognized upon substantial completion of the services required of the company as stated in the franchise agreement which is generally upon opening of the respective restaurant fees collected in advance are deferred until earned with deferred amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within one year classified as current deferred income in the consolidated balance sheets royalty income is based on a percentage of franchisee gross sales and is recognized when earned which occurs at the franchiseesâ point of sale renewal fees are recognized when a renewal agreement with a franchisee becomes effective occasionally the company offers incentive programs to franchisees in conjunction with a franchise agreement sda or renewal agreement and when appropriate records the costs of such programs as reductions of revenue for our international business we sell master territory andor license agreements that typically allow the master licensee to either act as the franchisee or to subfranchise to

earned which generally occurs at the franchiseesâ point of sale renewal fees are recognized when a renewal agreement with a franchisee or licensee becomes effective rental income rental income for base rentals is recorded on a straightline basis over the lease term including the amortization of any tenant improvement dollars paid see noteÂ i the differences between the straightline rent amounts and amounts receivable under the leases are recorded as deferred rent assets in current or longterm assets as appropriate contingent rental income is recognized as earned and any amounts received from lessees in advance of achieving stipulated thresholds are deferred until such thresholds are actually achieved deferred contingent rentals are recorded as deferred income in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets sales of ice cream and other products we distribute baskinrobbins ice cream products and in limited cases dunkinâ donuts products to franchisees and licensees in certain

transactions costs from the sales of restaurants that were not companyoperated to new or existing franchisees licensing fees are recognized when earned which is generally upon sale of the underlying products by the licensees gains on the refranchise or sale of a restaurant are recognized when the sale transaction closes the franchisee has a minimum amount of the purchase price in atrisk equity and we are satisfied that the buyer can meet its financial obligations to us if the criteria for gain recognition are not met we defer the gain to the extent we have any remaining financial exposure in connection with the sale transaction deferred gains are recognized when the gain recognition criteria are met    p allowance for doubtful accounts we monitor the financial condition of our franchisees and licensees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees or licensees are unable to make their required payments while we use the best information available in making our determination the ultimate recovery of recorded receivables is also dependent upon future economic events and other conditions that may be beyond our control included in the allowance for doubtful notes and accounts receivables is a provision for uncollectible royalty lease ice cream and licensing fee receivables q sharebased payments we measure compensation cost at fair value on the date of grant for all sharebased awards and recognize compensation expense over the service period that the awards are expected to vest the company has elected to recognize compensation cost for gradedvesting awards subject only to a service condition over the requisite service period of the entire award r income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future tax consequences of items that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse the effects of changes in tax rates and changes in apportionment of income between tax jurisdictions on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the year in which the law is enacted or change in apportionment occurs valuation allowances are provided when the company does not believe it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of identified tax assets a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement estimates of interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in the provision for income taxes s comprehensive income comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income foreign currency translation adjustments and gains and losses on interest rate swaps and is reported in the consolidated

certificates sold is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets there are no expiration dates on our gift cards and we do not charge any service fees while our franchisees continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment we may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain cards due to long periods of inactivity in these circumstances we may recognize income from unredeemed gift cards âbreakage incomeâ if they are not subject to unclaimed property laws for dunkinâ donuts gift cards enrolled in the dd perksÂ® rewards loyalty program and other cards with expected similar redemption behavior breakage is estimated and recognized at the point in time when the likelihood of redemption of any remaining card balance becomes remote generally after a period of sufficient inactivity breakage on all other dunkinâ donuts gift cards and all baskinrobbins gift cards is estimated and recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions based on historical redemption rates the company recognizes breakage as income only up to the amount of gift card program costs any incremental breakage on dunkin donuts gift cards that exceeds gift card program costs is committed to fund future    initiatives that will benefit the dunkinâ donuts gift card program or to offset future gift card program costs any

amounts due from franchisees and licensees for franchise fees royalty income and sales of ice cream and other products in addition we have note and lease receivables from certain of our franchisees and licensees the financial condition of these franchisees and licensees is largely dependent upon the underlying business trends of our brands and market conditions within the quick service restaurant industry this concentration of credit risk is mitigated in part by the large number of franchisees and licensees of each brand and the shortterm nature of the franchise and license fee and lease receivables at decemberÂ   and decemberÂ    one master licensee including its majorityowned subsidiaries accounted for approximately  and   respectively of total accounts and notes receivable

only a singlestep quantitative test to identify and measure impairment and record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unitâs carrying amount over its fair value the option to perform a qualitative assessment first for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary does not change under the new guidance this guidance is effective for the company beginning in fiscal year  with early adoption permitted the company expects to adopt this guidance in fiscal year  the adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the companyâs consolidated financial statements in november  the fasb issued new guidance addressing diversity in practice that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash in the statements of cash flows this guidance is effective for the company beginning in fiscal year  with early adoption permitted the company expects to adopt this guidance retrospectively beginning in fiscal year  upon adoption restricted cash will be combined with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows and the current presentation of changes in restricted cash within operating and financing activities will be eliminated upon adoption of this guidance net cash provided by operating activities will be reduced by  million and will increase by  million for fiscal years  and  respectively and net cash used in financing activities will increase by  thousand and will be reduced by  million for fiscal years  and  respectively the adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets in march  the fasb issued new guidance for employee sharebased compensation which simplifies several aspects of accounting for sharebased payment transactions including excess tax benefits forfeiture estimates statutory tax withholding requirements and classification in the statements of cash flows this guidance is effective for the company in fiscal year  with early adoption permitted the company expects to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year  upon adoption any future excess tax benefits or deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations instead of additional paidin capital in the consolidated balance sheets additionally excess tax benefits will be presented retrospectively as an operating cash inflow instead of a financing cash inflow in the statements of cash flows during fiscal years   and   million   million Â andÂ   million  respectively of excess tax benefits were recorded to additional paidin capital that would have been recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes and such amounts would have been classified as operating cash inflows instead of financing cash inflows in the consolidated statements of cash flows if this new guidance had been adopted as of the respective dates in february  the fasb issued new guidance for lease accounting which replaces existing lease accounting guidance the new guidance aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease    assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements this guidance is effective for the company in fiscal year  with early adoption permitted and modified retrospective application is required the company expects to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year  and is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on the companyâs consolidated financial statements and related disclosures the company expects that substantially all of its operating lease commitments see note  will be subject to the new guidance and will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets upon adoption in may  the fasb issued new guidance for revenue recognition related to contracts with customers except for contracts within the scope of other standards which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance the new guidance provides a single framework in which revenue is required to be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new guidance is effective for the company in fiscal year  with early adoption permitted in fiscal year  the company expects to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year  using the full retrospective transition method which will result in restating each prior reporting period presented in the year of adoption the company expects the adoption of the new guidance to change the timing of recognition of initial franchise fees including master license and territory fees for our international business and renewal fees currently these fees are generally recognized upfront upon either opening of the respective restaurant or when a renewal agreement becomes effective the new guidance will generally require these fees to be recognized over the term of the related franchise license for the respective restaurant which we expect will result in a material impact to revenue recognized for franchise fees and renewal fees the company does not expect this new guidance to materially impact the recognition of royalty income rental income or sales of ice cream and other products the company is continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on these and other revenue transactions as well as the presentation of advertising fund revenues and expenses in addition

dunkin donuts us comparable store sales were disappointing weather was about a  basis point headwind for us as our core northeast markets were hit hard in march but thats not an excuse  basis points of comp growth would have been disappointing as well that said we believe we have the right strategic plan in place for the future and our confidence is demonstrated by the fact that we are reconfirming our dunkin donuts us comparable store sales growth guidance youll recall that our plan includes building our company culture faster and improved product innovation targeted value and smart pricing being a leader in digital improving the restaurant experience and driving consumer packaged goods and new channels we know our brand can deliver more growth but as weve been saying all along there will be quarterly ups and downs in our performance along the way let me take a step back and address whats going on in the retail industry the consumer is demanding higherquality products more quickly and at lower prices a phenomenon known as the amazon effect its pushing grocery stores to lower food prices to compete and is resulting in a greater than threepoint gap between foodathome and foodawayfromhome indices additionally while us unemployment is extremely low in fact less than  in some states and with wage growth rising inflation is rising more rapidly stronger inflation is translating into slightly lower real income which means less disposable income and consumers are becoming more selective with how they spend those extra dollars that means the brand differentiation is critical a large part of this differentiation for dunkin will be using industryleading digital technologies to deliver a more convenient experience for our guests the current marketplace also impacts us in another way with low unemployment it is harder to attract and retain quality labor and the average labor turnover rate in our industry is greater than  yes  long term we believe that a low unemployment rate is good news for the economy however we are working closely with our franchisees to help strategically offset labor cost increases in the restaurants heres how we do it first youll recall that in february we began a store streamlined menu test we believe that streamlined menu is making dunkin an easier place to work and that we believe will reduce turnover in the long term ive personally visited two of the test markets and in my conversations with restaurant managers they shared their enthusiasm for the simplified menu saying it is making training the crew much easier improved morale and creating a better sense of teamwork secondly we held a people summit in florida this past month for our franchises it was dedicated to discussing best practices for recruiting hiring managing and motivating employees as well as addressing the unique needs of a millennial crewmember nearly  franchisees and staff attended so less turnover a happier crew simplified restaurant operations and great conversations with our franchisees about management practices should lead to a better guest experience thats how it works and a better guest experience is a critical element in our plan to distinguish ourselves in a highly competitive environment i mentioned earlier about the importance of utilizing technology a key element of our sixpart plan as a way to differentiate ourselves based on my feature  industry experience i recognized when i joined the company back in  that we needed onetoone marketing and a treasure trove of data that comes with it this kicked off a series of strategic preplanned events let me take you back firstly is the rollout of an unified pos system in  the introduction of our app in  the launch of the perks loyalty program three years later and then last year the rollout of onthego mobile ordering i believe our industryleading digital platforms will continue to bolster our topline sales for years to come dave will go into this topic in more detail later on during q we also celebrated and we certainly did celebrate the successful launch of dunkin donuts readytodrink bottled iced coffee which is being manufactured distributed and sold by the cocacola company along with its bottling partners and its in grocery chains gas drug and convenience stores nationally and in dunkin donuts restaurants in fact dunkin donuts readytodrink bottled iced coffee was named the best new product in january as part of a reader survey by the beverage industry magazine our entry into the rtd category means more people are drinking dunkin donuts coffee every day in fact we estimate we will sell through the various channels nearly  trillion cups of coffee globally this year with that ill hand it over to dave who will cover the dunkin donuts us performance dave david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc thanks nigel and good morning everyone when i came to dunkin after plus years in the industry i undertook an immersive training experience which involved there months of working in our restaurants and through this i developed a true understanding of how our restaurant operations and the needs of our franchisees their employees and of course our guests its an experience that will guide the decisions that i make and help me better support our franchisees and the brand going forward so now on to the first quarter our systemwide sales grew nearly  in the us primarily through new store growth comparable store sales were flat as ticket growth was offset by traffic declines ticket growth was approximately  inclusive in ticket growth was less discounting yearoveryear and a slightly positive mix shift strategic price continue to be in the  basis point range from a category standpoint breakfast sandwich sales were strong driven by value messaging iced coffee sales were also up riding on the cold brew platform now looking forward we are excited about our fruited iced teas which are available nationwide today as well as our unique dunkin energy punch powered by monster energy currently being offered across the northeast and miami dunkin punch is an innovation that came directly from our franchisees and crew that we believe will especially appeal to our millennial customers were also thrilled about the launch of our new frozen coffee its the magic of our bestinclass iced coffee but now frozen its an amazing product so to kick of the launch we are hosting our firstever national tasting event on friday may  from  am to  pm where well be providing free samples of frozen dunkin coffee to all of our guests and of course we will always post a national value messaging throughout the year in both traditional and digital channels as nigel mentioned our efforts in the digital space are critical to differentiate ourselves from the competition we now have  million perks members and during the first quarter dd perks represented greater than  of dunkin us sales while onthego ordering grew to nearly  of transactions at the end of march we announced the partnership with waze the realtime crowdsourced traffic and navigation app dunkin became the first partner for wazes new feature order ahead which lets wazers skip a line by submitting orders in advance through the dunkin mobile app we also participated in a highly successful tmobile tuesdays promotion designed to drive transactions and perks enrollment where tmobile users were eligible to claim a free virtual dunkin card these strategic partnerships along with our delivery and catering test with doordash demonstrate our continued focus on broadening our accessibility and convenience now let me move to restaurant development in q in the first quarter dunkin us franchisees opened  net new restaurants versus  net new units last year our franchisees also completed  remodels during the quarter dunkin has a unique combination in the retail and restaurant space of a strong heritage and tremendous longterm growth we ended  the year we went public with just shy of  restaurants in the west region and very few territorial development agreements in place today we finished q of this year with development agreements now in place in many key markets across the region and more than  locations we believe that longterm we can have  sites in the region and let me remind you that when we say west we mean the entire region west of the mississippi obviously the key to smart development is franchisee profitability if our franchisees are profitable they will build more restaurants its as simple as that and of course that fuels dunkin brands earnings growth also critical to store development is a strong franchisorfranchisee relationship built on trust and mutual respect and i could tell you during nigels eightplus years at dunkin i know hes spent a significant amount of time building solid relationships with our franchisees these relationships along with responsible growth are top priorities for me as well strategic partnerships are just as important as new growth in increasing our brand presence so in april we were proud to announce that dunkin hot coffee is now available on board amtrak acela express highspeed trains throughout the northeast corridor with the new agreement our hot coffee is now available to the  million customers who ride acela express trains each year going forward we are obviously excited to build on our new partnership with amtrak since coming on board ive been asked several times and by many folks how hard can it possibly be to run a dunkin restaurant and the answer is well pretty difficult what makes us unique in our industry is that we literally customize and personalize every order a great example of this is our core product hot coffee there are literally thousands of different ways you can order it now its imperative especially in this highly competitive market that we serve our customers their coffee exactly as they ordered it but if my time training in the restaurant showed me anything it was how difficult it is to get the basics fast accurate and friendly right with our complex menu as nigel referenced earlier the new streamlined menu is being well received by restaurant managers and crew and we will be rolling it out to the  additional restaurants later this year again obviously menu simplification does involve the elimination of some of our slower moving products thats why we are taking our time to test the impact of this sku rationalization and we believe the benefits in the long run will help drive topline sales and improve restaurantlevel margin this will continue to be a cultural mindset for our organization as menu simplification broadens into overall restaurant simplification collectively as a system were on journey a journey to continue to move up the consumer experiential curve and distance ourselves from the competitors that are commoditizing their offering our consumer research last summer showed that guests want to use dunkin as a place to take five minutes not  minutes and as we jokingly say around here there are other coffee houses where you can go to write your screenplay thats just not us its not who our customers want us to be our goal is to be the most beloved beverageled togo brand in the country its about ensuring that the dunkin experience is not one that can be replicated elsewhere we want to be a place of positive transition in peoples lives whether its from home to the office from dropping the kids at school to hitting the gym there are endless transitions that people go through every day and we want to be the brand that people turn to to help set the tone for their day we are using the consumer insights we gained last year from our deepdive study with thousands of customers and the starting point for our new restaurant design including the drivethru more than half of our restaurants included drivethru and with our customers need for a fast transaction improving our drivethrus with new designs and technologies offers us a significant competitive advantage and a real opportunity to optimize how we will serve not only todays guests but future guests as well so in closing look we know that we need to get transactions moving in the right direction thats why we are executing against our sixpart plan we believe it gives us the right balance of driving traffic through beverages and ticket through food attachment menu simplification will continue to play a key role in unlocking improved operations a better customer experience and increased franchisee profitability giving dunkin brands and our franchisees the ability to continue to invest back into the business around menu innovation digital technologies and convenience so let me stop there and ill turn it back over to nigel to take your through our baskinrobbins us and international results nigel nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc thanks dave baskinrobbins us comparable store sales were negative during the first quarter driven by decline in traffic offset by increased average ticket as i mentioned earlier the dunkin donuts us we are undertaking digital technology initiatives with baskin us including rolling out a new mobile app which has had more than  downloads since it launched last year and testing delivery we look forward now to rolling out our home delivery test to more markets in the near term moving on to international there is tremendous instability in many parts of the world right now and it continues to weigh on both of our brands overseas we know international needs to perform better and the team is highly engaged in making that happen we have a plan to stabilize the business with focus on our toppriority markets were driving initiatives to improve the customer experience expand convenience and increase transactions a good example is saudi arabia where baskinrobbins expanded its delivery program and now includes more than  delivery hubs on the mobile side the dunkin donuts app in germany has had nearly  downloads since it launched just shy of a year ago and during the quarter we opened dunkin donuts in the netherlands thats a great experience if you go there before i hand it over to kate to cover our financials id like to say that im proud of and energized by how the organization has handled our recent leadership changes its a credit to our succession planning process which i believe is one of our core organizational strengths so over to kate kate jaspon  dunkin brands group inc thanks nigel the growth in revenue for the first quarter was primarily due to increased royalty income resulting from our systemwide sales growth rental income also contributed to revenue growth and the sale of our companyowned restaurants resulted in us having approximately  more leases in our real estate portfolio which we now collect rent on these increases were offset by no longer having sales from companyowned restaurants in q  we owned  points of distribution which contributed  million in revenue operating income and adjusted operating income growth was driven by the increase in royalty income as ga expenses remained flat yearoveryear q last year was also unfavorably impacted by the net operating results of the companyowned restaurants the increase in net income and adjusted net income for the first quarter was primarily the net result of the increase in operating income as well as a decrease in income tax expense the decrease in tax expense was driven by  million of excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation which are now included in our pl and our effective tax rate as a result of the required adoption of a new accounting standard our effective tax rate for the quarter was  including approximately  basis points of impact from this new standard diluted earnings per share and diluted adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter increased by  to  and  to  respectively the increase in our shares outstanding was due to the exercise of stock options and the new accounting standard offset by the repurchase of shares since the first quarter of  excluding the impact of excess tax benefits earnings per share would have been  lower at the end of the first quarter we had a debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of  during the quarter we generated approximately  million in free cash flow we ended the quarter with close to  million in cash and shortterm restricted cash on the balance sheet of that  million represents cash associated with our gift card programs and our marketing fund balances we used  million in cash during the quarter to pay our q cash dividend to shareholders as you may have noticed we increased our fullyear earnings per share guidance to reflect the approximately  tax benefit we recognized during the first quarter due to the new accounting standards weve also revised our fullyear effective tax rate to  to include the impacts of the excess tax benefit recognized in q this benefit reduced our fullyear effective tax rate by approximately  basis points our guidance excludes any potential future material impact as a result of the new accounting standards we are proud to have returned nearly  billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and our quarterly dividend programs since going public in july of  id like to take this opportunity to address our share repurchase philosophy we tend to think about repurchases holistically for the year rather than on a quartertoquarter basis several factors go into our decision on share repurchases so while we ended q with a sizeable cash balance available to us especially given our assetlight model it does not signal any change in our commitment to returning value to our shareholders and with that ill turn the call back over to stacey to begin the qa session stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks kate shannon were ready for the qa session questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from john glass with morgan stanley you may begin john glass  morgan stanley  co llc thanks very much kate can i ask maybe just couple of questions on your role of value you talked about the consumer being more valuesensitive so as youve gotten into the brand and looked at it and come from a major competitor thats obviously focused historically on value how do you see changes necessary on the value side of the business and when you look at your first quarter results is there a way to see â are you losing your most valuesensitive customers for example smaller coffees for example is there a way to parse results to indicate that in fact thats whats happening or is it a broader based decline in traffic across all price points lets say david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yeah thanks john hey look chris and i will tag team on this one but value is going to continue to be core to who we are as a brand coming out of q learnings are â value is going to take on more prominence going forward and as i mentioned youre going to see us pulse in national offers at a greater rate throughout the year but in addition to that digital is going to continue to evolve as the key platform for us on everyday value in addition to being a recruiting tool as well but just taking a step back on your point about what were seeing out of hot coffee i mean for us we wouldnt differentiate ourselves from coffee commodity players and our value equation is also about our great quality from the bean to grind fresh brew fresh every time thats the campaign that were driving out there as well so we know we have to â its a competitive environment were going to continue to dialup the value as we go forward that was one of the key learnings coming out of q but were bullish on what weve got for the remainder of the year chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc yeah and thanks for the question john we think about this we think about the price value experience equation we think we have pricing in a much better place with some proprietary tools we put in place were talking with our franchisees on pricing on a much more regular basis i think we have a value strategy that is locked in sold in and ready to go for the balance of the year weve learned a lot in q and our sixpoint plan one of the key components is focusing on that restaurant experience so that when a guest comes into our restaurant they experience the best of all three parts of the equation nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so let me just add a little bit there i mean obviously weve added a few changes in the last few quarters but one thing that daves really added to our organization is a bite  on value and i think hes come with a credibility of what happened to his previous employer and i think it helps us communicate much more effectively with our franchisees the benefit of value marketing so i think thats true added value from what we had previously stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks john john glass  morgan stanley  co llc thank you stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc operator next question operator our next question comes from john ivankoe with jpmorgan you may begin john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc hi thank you not to put words in your mouth but listening to what youre talking about today still expansion of the simplified menu  stores adding an additional  stores by yearend labor cost labor availability which is very clearly tightening listening to your prepared remarks nigel and negative samestore traffic and perhaps an increased need for value all those things together again just looking from the outside looking in suggest that franchisees might slow down their development in other words  might not have been the down year of development that we may have some more to go with some of the underpinnings of the brand and underpinnings of profitability get worked out so i just wanted to use this format and venue to just give us your sense of what that very important piece to the business model is in terms of future franchising and development in the us nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so john yeah a complicated question and i think ive got it so let me comment on that i mean there is no doubt the environment is more competitive as you pointed out and i pointed out earlier in terms of lets say the pressure on the marketplace on the consumer being more selective so thats one secondly is the fact that labor is tighter if you ask all our franchisees what their number one issue is they will say its finding good labor but it isnt just our sector there was recently a boston global article that talked about the lack of cooks in boston so its affecting the whole industry its affecting also industries like the construction industry so one of the things that i think needs to be tackled and this is really an administration issue is how to increase the labor pool theres all kinds of ways of doing it theres all kinds of proposals on how to go through it today but we need to increase the labor pool because it is getting tight out there and i think its going to have an impact not only on us but others because people just cant get labor i think were being incredibly proactive and besides helping our franchisees find a way of retaining people which is the best way of tackling labor turnover were also finding ways to reduce their cost weve got a very proactive approach working through cost reductions at the dcp energy savings and the streamlined menu test well also i think find ways of taking some labor out through things like having less time spent on things like inventory so coming back to how all that fits together i think our franchisees are very confident as we said they have invested in these both brands over  billion over the last couple of years i think theyve got great confidence in what dave is doing we continue to be a development machine i havent gotten all the numbers at hand but when i compare our development for the first quarter against everyone elses apart from starbucks i would suggest that we may have opened more stores in the first quarter than just about anyone else over the whole year so again we remain a development machine obviously its a top logistical exercise to manage all this development but were on top of it but the core is unit economics the core is getting the right labor and were totally focused on tackling those issues john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc and of all the factors that weve discussed nigel ill ask the question in a slightly different way doesnt it make sense that the rate of development in the us slowed down from where we are in other words should you be growing as quickly as you are given some of the external and internal challenges that your business are facing nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc well weve guided  weve retained that guidance i know john you have a thesis that weve discussed many times and i always love your challenges because they always lead to great animated debates but we feel that weve got the right plan to deliver our goals we continue to stay focus on that and i suspect youd love us to come down to about  and feel comfortable with it but weve got to stretch all the development we can get stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks john john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jeffrey bernstein with barclays you may begin jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc great thank you very much maybe just twopart question on comps and the components within it one im just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the trends you saw in the first quarter and how that relates to your full year guidance which again does assume an uptick but yet the compares are relatively stable so the first question is just whether youre assuming a macro uptick for the rest of the year or maybe you have some internal product or initiative that you think are going to accelerate trends and then the second related part was just on the pricing i think dave you mentioned that pricing is currently running in that  range i was wondering whether theres any color from franchisees or whats your learning in those discussions in terms of whether theres intent to ease pricing further in  and whether perhaps that happens naturally through the more aggressive value that youre talking about thanks nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc jeff thanks a lot im going to pass that straight over to dave and chris david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yes thanks jeff in terms of q learnings in the calendar year of course its a competitive environment as youve heard from us were not coming off guidance of lowsingledigit growth for the year the thing id say to you is were obviously more than a one quarter company were executing against our plan to transition as a beverageled onthego brand but very much as youve heard me talk about value very much steeped in value convenience and accessibility and ill let chris elaborate on this a little bit more but just to your point on pricing again the contribution was  basis points for the quarter again were working with our franchisees with pricing workshops out there using our proprietary pricing tool that we developed with apt of course we triangulate this always with cpi foodawayfromhome foodathome et cetera but its going to be a lever for us but its not our only lever as we look at productivity improvements up and down the pl so theres many there but this is a lever but its not our only one that were pulling chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc yeah and then dave i would add i think if you look at at what were trying to do over the longterm were in the second inning of implementing a new strategy we think about our sixpart strategy its something thats going to drive longterm comp growth longterm revenue growth if we look at the quarter our twoyear stack was a little bit better than q were reiterating our lowsingledigit guidance on comps for the balance of the year and then on pricing this pricing optimization tool helps us do a few things it helps us look at a storebystore basis there are stores that shouldnt touch price at all because of certain components there are others that have opportunities in some categories but not others and i would say were getting much more granular on the discussion around pricing with our franchisees than we have in the past and like dave said its a lever but its not the only lever nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so chris let me just ask you a question follow up on that so how receptive are the franchisees in your mind to this new pricing tool chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc theyre asking for meetings theyre asking for more engagement on a regular basis so weve had a pretty good relationship in this area in the past we have an even better one today were adding resources on pricing we have people out in the markets talking about this but a number of other things on a regular basis jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc and any color on the sequential trend through the quarter or those in the quarter chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc i think in keeping with our historic practices were not going to give sequential trends stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks jeff jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc thank you operator our next question comes from nicole miller with piper jaffray you may begin nicole miller regan  piper jaffray thanks good morning nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc hi nicole miller regan  piper jaffray looking back at the meeting you talked about with  franchise and staff members what did you hear from them what did they like or not like and what kind of suggestions did they make thanks nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc sorry you came out with  you talked about the  stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc the people summit nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc oh the people summit nicole miller regan  piper jaffray yes yes nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay all right so well firstly i wasnt there for the whole time so rich emmett whos sitting in the room was so ill ask him to comment in a second but the first message nicole was as ive said everyone is concerned about labor i mean thats why we have  people turn up i mean they are concerned about finding the right people theyre concerned about how to pay the people theyre concerned about what kind of culture and i think it is something â this might not sound spectacular to some of you on the phone who work for big companies but we have as ive said in my remarks lots of small businesspeople and words like culture are kind of a new thing and culture isnt something you just pull off the wall and stick it in its something you have to build and one of the benefits of being in a  franchise system is that you actually have a bunch of different cultures and that gives in my view the unique characteristics of dunkin is that it has a personalization at every store and im always amazed when i go and talk to journalists they always talk about their individual experience at different stores so they have to build the culture to keep people in their organization so i think they focus very much on what kind of compensation strategies they need what kinds of payment structures how they recruit people but rich you were there the whole time richard j emmett  dunkin brands group inc okay hi nicole yeah nigel you covered most of it various franchisees have various needs some need to start with recruiting how do we recruit the type of employee that we want to come in in the door there are others that have recruiting figured out they want to learn more about how to onboard those that theyve recruited there are others that listen to other franchisees through best practice seminars in terms of what are best practices in terms of pay in terms of retention which is very very important if you had a good employee you certainly want to keep him its a lot easier to keep a good employee than to hire a new one and that plays right into one of the main themes of what nigel just talked about and that is developing a culture within your respective franchise organization because its the culture that plays a very key role certainly pay is important everything else is important but if you can develop the untenable thing known as culture you will be the employer of choice and be that company or franchisee that people want to come to and that people want to continue to work for nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc yeah i just want to talk about one thing because your question brings this to mind we talked about  that is an industry number that is not our number and we have some franchisees down there who have created such a great culture because they have no turnover i mean im often shocked when i find out everyone has been there for like   years stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks nicole nicole miller regan  piper jaffray thank you operator our next question comes from david tarantino with baird you may begin david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc hi good morning dave my questions for you about this simplification initiative first if you could maybe comment on what youre seeing so far in terms of sales and margins and then maybe a broader followup to that would be can you talk about what your vision is in terms of margin improvement related to simplification is it tens of basis points hundreds of basis points and then maybe on a related question about the roic for franchisees is there any opportunity to also improve the development cost side of the equation david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc david yeah thanks for the question and youre going to be underfed on the answer unfortunately im not going to â were not going to get into it but you can interpret that everything is very much in line with expectations with the idea that were going to take this to another  locations going forward we want to be very fiduciary in our thinking and making sure that we really understand going from the current  to  we understand the impact but look its obvious decluttering the restaurant taking out slow moving skus makes it easier for the crew it makes it better for the customer and were seeing a lot of improvements on the pl there is great velocity on the pl up and down but its still early but the other part of this is simplification is also all about creating room for growth so that we can invest in new innovations in menu and digital as well as investments in value going forward as well so again let us get a few more markets on the board before we telegraph a lot of that but you can certainly interpret the expansion as everything is in line with expectations stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks david operator our next question comes from david palmer with rbc capital markets you may begin david palmer  rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning just a followup to davids question could you just give specifics about perhaps what youre trying to solve with the menu rationalization is it largely around speed and throughput and is it about the margins that are going to offset to labor pressures and then perhaps relatedly beverage focus makes a lot of sense but how are you rethinking the role of future â in the future of food and what role can that be in your growth and how much is that perhaps gone too far in one direction thats maybe hurt you lately thanks chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc david thanks for the question this is chris so our research last year showed us that we werent really known as a food or a beverage player so the whole idea behind our strategy is to be the mostloved onthego beverages brand we want to drive speed and throughput with menu simplification with a focus on really getting those bestinclass beverages out there we want to drive profits for our franchisees we want to address some of the labor challenges that nigel has talked about reducing turnover because dunkin will be a better place to work we think it cleans up the restaurants we think it leads to improved margins on food cost we think it leads to fewer throwaways better waste management it leads to easier unloading of trucks in the stores as an example there are a lot of benefits that will show up in various parts of the pl and we think this is one of the major unlocks to getting this strategy that weve talked about recently really going in the right direction stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks david david palmer  rbc capital markets llc thank you operator our next question comes from karen holthouse with goldman sachs you may begin karen holthouse  goldman sachs  co hi just a quick modeling question i was a little bit surprised to see other revenue down yearoveryear in the quarter you still â looks like youve been seeing retail sales growth on the packaged coffee side on the kcups side would have expected to start to see a benefit from readytodrink maybe just help us out with whatever moving pieces could be heading that line nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so let me just kick off and then im going to get kate to do the more detailed answer this is always an interesting area for us and clearly all of you have different assumptions i think one thing i will say because i think its important for me to say is as ive said in my prepared comments were delighted with the start of rtd but its not like instantly on if we go into a restaurant with a new product its instantly on if you launch into with rtd it takes time to go through the system because each brand has its own reset of its organization on where the products go so youre facing may not be the reality that we see and because were a relatively new company to consumer products clearly some of that is new to us as well so with that said were delighted with rtd were delighted with what were doing on kcups and kate will take you through the detail kate jaspon  dunkin brands group inc great thanks nigel i think the other thing i wanted to remind everybody on is the other revenue line item while it does include all of the packaged cup the kcups and rtd it also includes other items and we are rolling over a sizable transfer that was included in the first quarter of  so excluding this to nigels point rtd which we rolled out with coke rolled out midfebruary of this quarter so just about half of the quarter and to nigels point is gaining in distribution but were happy with that and kcups volume has gone up so i think if you factor all three of those together that gives us the bridge between the consensus number and what weve reported karen holthouse  goldman sachs  co great thank you stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks karen operator our next question comes from gregory francfort with bank of america you may begin gregory r francfort  bank of america hey guys can i go back to johns question on store development i think the last cashoncash return number youve given us for west and emerging was just over  is that the right metric that we should be thinking about or is it â maybe could you provide us with an update on that number kate jaspon  dunkin brands group inc so we typically provide the update on the third quarter of our fiscal year so were not ready yet to update that because of the results coming in on a lag but the information we gave is still gregory r francfort  bank of america right and we expect the  cohort to be in that  to  range and to kates earlier point well discuss that later in the year gregory r francfort  bank of america got it thanks and then just scott can you talk about franchisee operations and maybe whats changed operationally with mobile ordering and do franchisees add labor do they reduce labor do they rearrange labor and how was adoption looked in some urban markets versus suburban markets nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so just make sure â we often have scott murphy on this call and hes not here so its scott hudler today whos going to talk about the operational side and digital together scott hudler  dunkin brands group inc yeah so thanks for the question i think were seeing a lot of really positive energy coming from franchisees around onthego ordering what theyre seeing is at this point theyre deploying labor in a different way and making and delivering a better guest experience for people that are coming in because they dont have to stand in line and we know that roughly  to  of the transaction time its just the ordering the back and forth with the crew person running the register so as weve eliminated that part of the transaction we get people in and out faster and we can help to drive more throughput to your suburban urban question were definitely seeing this as a strong driver in some of our more urban locations so think manhattan downtown boston some of our bigger markets that were definitely seeing strong results from those but also from suburban locations that are near an entry point to a major highway so think long island were seeing some of our best results from those locations gregory r francfort  bank of america awesome thanks guys stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks greg operator our next question comes from will slabaugh with stephens inc you may begin william e slabaugh  stephens inc yeah thank you wonder if you could talk a little bit more about your first focal point you mentioned at the beginning of your talk where you rehighlighted the building a coffee culture can you talk about where you think you are today versus where you want to be from a standpoint of offerings and then also perception by the consumer and also on the back of that is it fair to think about this coffee evolution as you sort of going through as the most important point in driving more consistently positive comps or am i downplaying something else there chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc so thats a great question and i think theres a reason that its the first component of our sixpart strategy building our coffee culture really gets at the core of what we want this brand to be like going forward we look at everything from revised advertising with campaigns like this is coffee which gets people to really understand that were grinding fresh were brewing fresh were doing something different than anybody else in the industry and consumers when they really dive into that realized that its different and we think its better we have focused operationally think about that one of the other components of our strategy is to improve restaurant operations we had our entire ops team visit all  plus locations in the month of march to go out and look at every single component of what goes into making a great cup of coffee working with our crew working with our franchisees on really delivering bestinclass products so if you think about all the things were doing on hot coffee thats one component of building the coffee culture then you move into specialty coffee iced coffee cold brew the expansion of rtd what were doing in the cpg on kcups and packaged coffee this is all about becoming a major player in the coffee industry in an even bigger way that we are today and we look at product innovation we look at some of the value offerings we look at the underlying components of the loyalty program everything focused on driving against the coffee culture and building growth going forward thats the thesis david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc and will its dave the other piece for me coming in after spending plus years in the industry and the soul of dunkin is just that great quality cup of coffee and i think it was surprising to me when i got here the quality of the bean that we used grind fresh brew fresh every pod minute hold time these are industryleading that i dont think can be matched so we probably havent shouted that enough and as chris mentioned they put a brilliant campaign together called this is coffee and its out there running right now that really speaks to our attributes and separates us from a quality cup of coffee versus the commodity players that are out there stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks will operator our next question comes from jason west with credit suisse you may begin jason west  credit suisse securities usa llc yeah thanks a couple â one quick one and another question so are you guys providing the store counts openings by region anymore and then secondly looking at that net discounting which is adding another  basis points or so to the pricing is that going to start rolling off i think were lapping the change in the combos from early last year i dont know if thats affecting that still or as youre trying to become more focused on value in this competitive environment it seems a bit counterintuitive to have such a big increase in your net discounting thanks kate jaspon  dunkin brands group inc yes so ill take the first piece jason we arent on a quarterly basis anymore were going to do that more on a full year basis so you can expect towards the end of the year well give you its just noise on the quarter so we prefer to wait till the end of the year to give it to you on a full year basis chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc yes and then the question on net discounting as it applies i think youd take it back to a couple of questions ago where we were talking about the value price and experience equation we look at more national price points on value with one of the things that daves brought for certain is focusing the entire system on offers instead of having desperate offers by market so thats number one number two the continued expansion of the perks program thats really our value program in the future wed like to migrate towards that and number three driving traffic with beverages and ticket with food so i think youll see the offerings that we put out there will be aligned with that strategy and were very confident in the way our franchisees are going to execute it stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks jason operator our next question comes from matthew difrisco with guggenheim you may begin matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc thank you just a couple of quick bookkeeping ones so i just wanted to hear that did you say that  of sales were done or are associated with the perks members and then also would it be correct to assume in the less discounting world that the margins why wouldnt those margins of the cohorts why wont that go up more that  to  or so shouldnt that get stronger and then last question samestore sales any correlation with rtd being introduced did that cannibalize any of your storelevel sales throughout the quarter thanks scott hudler  dunkin brands group inc okay hey this is scott hudler ill take the first one yes  of sales in the quarter were through perks transactions and sitting here listening to all the questions we probably didnt say what a good quarter we felt we had on perks and thats the trend that we intend to continue going forward major part of the strategy as chris just said moving on to your second question about cashoncash returns and the margins we continue to focus on improving the margins i think were getting better in understanding by city by dma particularly in newer markets and everyones all over that you guys should probably take some credit for making  this so focused on that and finally on rtd we feel good about whats happened with rtd weve never believed it will be cannibalistic at all we believe its additive and actually a major part of our coffee strategy and chris youre going to say something about chris fuqua  dunkin donuts llc yes so then i look at the growth of cold brew and the growth of iced coffee in our restaurants and its one of the real highlights for what we look at so i think its a complementary strategy and were excited about it david l hoffmann  dunkin brands group inc yes and matthew just coming back to the cashoncash equation again any good operator and franchisor continues to look at the denominator side as well so that coming in here fresh we see opportunities on the cost side theyre taking cost â cost avoidance things in the site work the size of the footprint theres a lot of great opportunities in there as well so its multifaceted but rich opportunities in that area as well matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc thank you stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks matt operator our next question comes from dennis geiger with ubs you may begin dennis geiger  ubs securities llc great thank you just following up on the dd perks question and the commentary there i saw the performance during the quarter but just wondering if you could talk a bit more about the opportunities to grow that both by increasing members and then increasing the spend maybe if you could just first talk about continuing to bring customers into that ecosystem and then maybe what inning were in as it relates to the direct marketing the suggestive selling and how much more you think you could get out of the perks numbers thank you scott hudler  dunkin brands group inc yes dennis this is scott so i think like nigel said were really encouraged about what we saw in q this is the ability to reach out to our customers on a onetoone basis its becoming increasingly more important as we see traditional kind of analog media the effect in those channels starts to decline so to be able to reach out to  million customers directly its a huge benefit for us also as we think about targeted and value discounting and chris mentioned that we want perks to evolve to the way we discount through the brand and that doesnt become from a more traditional kind of shotgun approach where we have necessarily offers that are open to everyone but they were being very surgical with offers that each individual consumer gets an offer that will drive increased visitation and spend to them versus just being part of a demo or a â even drilling down more we want them to be a very individualized offer so to do that we want to drive more people into the top of the funnel and we think doing that with some of the things weve done recently with showing consumers that there is an opportunity to save some money through the perks program with some of the price promotions weve run exclusive to perks members in the first quarter of the year as well as things like dave mentioned tmobile tuesdays which is an opportunity to partner with someone else a large partner like tmobile to come in and drive incremental members to the perks program stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc thanks dennis dennis geiger  ubs securities llc okay stacey caravella  dunkin brands group inc operator were going to take two more questions because were getting close to the top of the hour operator our next question is from andrew strelzik with bmo you may begin andrew strelzik  bmo capital markets united states hey good morning thanks for taking the question i had two things that i wanted to ask number one understanding that you look at share repurchases more holistically not on a quarterly basis it has been five or six quarters now since weve seen really any meaningful buyback so im just wondering within the context of that holistic view how youre thinking about or kind of what the hesitancy to buy back stock has been and number two when  of orders onthego not a huge percentage but a large absolute number just wondering what you see from behavioral perspective when someone gets into the program starts doing the onthego ordering from a frequency or check perspective any type of behavioral commentary will be helpful thank you nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay so then in reverse order as scott was just talking ill let him finish off talking about onthego and then well go to share repurchases scott hudler  dunkin brands group inc yes so yes  obviously we want that number to continue to grow were pleased with what we see on a weekly basis from a growth perspective that weve had a number of things to get people to knock down the barriers so whether thats in philly a  hot or iced coffee when you use onthego to get people to try out once we get people to try out we see incredibly high retrial rates of people coming back and using it and were continuing to see that repeat visit and we think as dave talked about value and convenience having someone order through onthego and to be able to see past the line in store its a huge convenient play nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so its interesting when i was in one of the test markets the store manager told me that they have a couple of customers who come in three or four times a day and the reason they can is onthego ordering because they order the same thing for i dont know what it was lets say a big iced coffee which is what scott drinks i dont know you have iced tea right scott hudler  dunkin brands group inc iced tea nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc iced tea and hes sitting here right now so he orders it or they order it and for them to come in not have to line up and just pick it up is the ultimate in convenience for them it saves so much time so we are really excited about whats happening with this kate share repurchases kate jaspon  dunkin brands group inc sure yes thanks for the question andrew so as i mentioned on the call we think about share repurchases holistically i dont think that you should take the fact that whether were in the market or not in the market during a given quarter as a signal to anything several factors that go into our decision around whether we repurchase stock and all those you include price is not the only factor we consider so were always thinking about taking all the potential cash needs for the business timing and our trading windows just as an example so as i mentioned even though we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance and didnt repurchase during the quarter that doesnt mean that we are running away from our current commitment to returning value to our shareholders andrew strelzik  bmo capital markets united states great thank you very much operator thank you our last question is from steve anderson with maxim group you may begin stephen anderson  maxim group llc yes good morning im calling to ask about your unit growth strategy and specifically in your partnerships with sort of retails including that bjs and so i just wanted to see how that relationship has been ongoing have you seen any cannibalization with any other stores nearby nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc so ill take that so i think if you look forward as dave mentioned in his remarks youre going to see us expanding our brand in a sensible way across the country i think the amtrak deal is a good example another one that we did years ago but i think its a good example of what were trying to do in terms of building the brand is jetblue which were very pleased with particularly as they keep growing very quickly bjs was a relationship that we are very happy with its actually our franchisees that run the stores its franchisee growth its not if you like direct cannibalization of the new franchisee on them so we feel good about that and i think the opportunity for april growth is staggering i mean heres a specific that came from one of our original quote in texas there are  colleges and universities were in one i mean that tells you the opportunity look at the airports around the country and i cant remember the actual number but i think its â were in sort of  airports dont take that as the right number its something like that but theres a lot more airports we can go in and i look at the success of places by lax airport where were doing staggering numbers i look at workplaces we went into the chrysler building in detroit and thats been off the charts in terms of success even though its got three of the starbucks around it so i feel weve got a wonderful opportunity to expand the brand bjs is just one of many examples stephen anderson  maxim group llc all right thank you operator thank you id now like to turn the call back over to nigel travis for closing remarks nigel travis  dunkin brands group inc okay well firstly thank you everyone for coming on today i recognize that this is probably getting towards the end of your earnings season and because there was an important meeting that we had to attend in washington we moved our earnings call but id like to leave you with five takeaways one we remain very focused on our sixpart strategy we are extremely confident we have the right plan and that will deliver future growth secondly major part of that plan is maintaining our digital leadership i think thats the major advantage for both dunkin and baskin and really does help us differentiate thirdly were very focused on the people issues that our franchisees are concerned about and hopefully i think that when i look at our relationships with our franchisees and our focus on unit economics the fact that theyve invested so heavily is a major demonstration and confidence that they have in our brands and finally were very committed to shareholder value so i think kate answered that very succinctly so hopefully everyone gets the message that were looking at every level we have to build our business forward so with that thank you very much and have a good day operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes
