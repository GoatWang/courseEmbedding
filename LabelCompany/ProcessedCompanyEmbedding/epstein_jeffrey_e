with whom epstein allegedly had sex attorneys for epstein fought for years to keep the substance of the negotiations leading to the unusual plea deal secret from lawyers for the alleged victims and from the public however a federal appeals court ruled last year that the discussions were not legally privileged newly disclosed excerpts of emails and letters exchanged by prosecutors and epsteins defense and posted here appear to indicate that federal authorities and epsteins lawyers worked to limit information judges might receive about aspects of the deal which involved epstein pleading guilty to a state charge in exchange for a guarantee not to prosecute him in federal court andy who wasnt further identified in the filing recommended that some of the time issues be addressed only in the state agreement so that it isnt obvious to the judge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison purposes assistant us attorney marie villafana wrote to epstein lawyer jay lefkowitz in a sept   email i will include our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and i will mention coconspirators but i would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge  maybe we can set a time to meet if you want to meet off campus somewhere that is fine i will make sure that i have all the necessary decision makers present or on call as well another email a few days later discusses the large number of individuals the fbi considered victims and continuing uncertainty about whether some of the young women were under the age of consent i wanted to tell you that i have compiled a list of  confirmed minors villafana wrote to lefkowitz there are six others whose name sic we already have who need to be interviewed by the fbi to confirm whether they were  or  at the time of their activity with mr epstein in a december  letter the prosecutor acknowledges some notifications of alleged victims but says they were sent after the us attorneys office signed the plea deal and halted for most of the women at the request of epsteins lawyers three victims were notified shortly after the signing of the nonprosecution agreement of the general terms of that agreement villafana wrote again to lefkowitz you raised objections to any victim notification and no further notifications were done after epstein pleaded guilty in june  to two state felony charges relating to prostitution two women who claimed to have been victims of the money mogul filed suit against the federal government claiming that prosecutors violated the crime victims rights act by failing to consult with them about the plea deal failing to disclose its terms and failing to keep victims informed about important developments in the case the suit asks that the nonprosecution deal be rescinded in the court filing unsealed monday the alleged victims lawyers — bradley edwards and paul cassell — contend that the correspondence backs up their view that the prosecution and epsteins defense worked together to frustrate the legal rights the alleged victims should have been accorded the exchanges demonstrate that the victims allegations of a conspiracy between the government and epsteins attorneys to conceal the existence of a broad nonprosecution agreement are not mere speculation but appear to be well supported edwards and cassell wrote they added that one email shows the parties negotiating to keep the judge in the dark about the full nature of the plea arrangement as well as keeping the victims ie the girls in the dark about the plea agreement until after epsteins plea it also shows the prosecutors setting up a meeting with the defense attorneys that would be off campus — ie outside the ordinary course of business epsteins lawyers — who included at various times such heavyweights as former independent counsel kenneth starr and harvard law professor alan dershowitz — argued that the law did not require federal prosecutors to make any notifications because the women were not victims of any crime being charged in a federal court epstein was ultimately sentenced to  months in jail on the state charges he served  before being released while judge kenneth marra made more information about the episode public monday he also dealt a setback to the women and attorneys pursuing the victims rights suit marra turned down the bulk of their request for the us attorneys offices internal files and memos about the case in his new ruling posted here the judge said most of that material including draft federal indictments should remain confidential as attorney work product or secret grand jury material however marra said the alleged victims were entitled to a few documents that appeared to have been shared with epsteins defense team or were largely factual in nature a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office in southern florida declined to comment on the ruling and the newly unsealed plea details federal prosecutors have previously said they agreed to the deal to spare victims the need to testify and to ease their ability to get financial compensation from epstein a lawyer for epstein roy black did not respond to a message seeking comment epsteins prosecution and the legal morass in which he is still enmeshed have attracted unusual notoriety because of his wealth as well as his ties to wellknown politicians professors and celebrities earlier this year a woman seeking to join the victims rights suit and identified as jane doe  alleged in court papers that she was kept as a sex slave by epstein and forced to have sex with prominent men including dershowitz and britains prince andrew both men flatly denied the allegations in april marra struck the lurid claims from the court record and denied jane doe s request to join the lawsuit republicans and conservatives have also taken a keen interest in president bill clintons connections to epstein hoping to make trouble for former secretary of state hillary clintons presidential bid press reports have noted that bill clinton as well as actors kevin spacey and chris tucker used epsteins private  to travel to africa in  for a clinton foundation tour of aidsfighting and development work flight logs filed in connection with another lawsuit show at least  journeys by clinton on epsteins planes id like to

in march when you hang out with a guy who has a reputation like jeffrey epstein multiple times on private jets on weekends on trips on places at least where its been reported not very good things happen it would be good to know what our former president was doing especially because it appears hes going to be part of a campaign ticket on the other side of the aisle last month conservative watchdog group judicial watch filed a freedom of information act lawsuit demanding all secret service records pertaining to the costs of any trips bill clinton made to epsteins private island in the caribbean spokespeople for hillary clintons campaign the clinton foundation and bill clinton did not respond to requests for comment at least one presidential hopeful who has since jumped in the ring

likes beautiful women as much as i do and many of them are on the younger side no doubt about it — jeffrey enjoys his social life a trump associate said tuesday that trump wasnt aware of any wrongdoing and that he and epstein were not particularly close he was a member of one of trumps clubs where he would visit with women and business associates but there was no formal relationship the

expensive real estate on earth exists the crown jewel of the city’s residential town houses with its foothigh oak door huge arched windows and nine floors it sits on—or rather commands—the block of st street between fifth and madison avenues almost ludicrously out of proportion with its four and fivestory neighbors it seems more like an institution than a house this is perhaps not surprising—until  it was the birch wathen private school now it is said to be manhattan’s largest private residenceinside amid the flurry of menservants attired in sober black suits and pristine white gloves you feel you have stumbled into someone’s private xanadu this is no mere rich person’s home but a highwalled eclectic imperious fantasy that seems to have no boundariesthe entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed eyeballs these the owner tells people with relish were imported from england where they were made for injured soldiers next comes a marble foyer which does have a painting in the manner of jean dubuffet … but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it in any case guests are like pygmies next to the nearby twicelifesize sculpture of a naked african warriordespite its eccentricity the house is curiously impersonal the statement of someone who wants to be known for the scale of his possessions its occupant financier jeffrey epstein  admits to friends that he likes it when people think of him this way a goodlooking man resembling ralph lauren with thick graywhite hair and a weathered face he usually dresses in jeans knit shirts and loafers he tells people he bought the house because he knew he “could never live anywhere bigger” he thinks  square feet is an appropriately large space for someone like himself who deals mostly in large concepts—especially large sums of moneyguests are invited to lunch or dinner at the town house—epstein usually refers to the former as “tea” since he likes to eat bitesize morsels and drink copious quantities of earl grey he does not touch alcohol or tobacco tea is served in the “leather room” so called because of the cordovancolored fabric on the walls the chairs are covered in a leopard print and on the wall hangs a huge oriental fantasy of a woman holding an opium pipe and caressing a snarling lionskin under her gaze plates of finger sandwiches are delivered to epstein and guests by the menservants in white glovesupstairs to the right of a spiral staircase is the “office” an enormous gallery spanning the width of the house strangely it holds no computer computers belong in the “computer room” a smaller room at the back of the house epstein has been known to say the office features a gilded desk which epstein tells people belonged to banker j p morgan thcentury black lacquered portuguese cabinets and a ninefoot ebony steinway “d” grand on the desk a paperback copy of the marquis de sade’s the misfortunes of virtue was recently spotted covering the floor epstein has explained “is the largest persian rug you’ll ever see in a private home—so big it must have come from a mosque” amid such splendor much of which reflects the work of the french decorator alberto pinto who has worked for jacques chirac and the royal families of jordan and saudi arabia there is one particularly startling oddity a stuffed black poodle standing atop the grand piano “no decorator would ever tell you to do that” epstein brags to visitors “but i want people to think what it means to stuff a dog” people can’t help but feel it’s epstein’s way of saying that he always has the last wordin addition to the town house epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling in new mexico on an  million acre ranch which he named “zorro” “it makes the town house look like a shack” epstein has said he also owns little st james a acre island in the us virgin islands where the main house is currently being renovated by edward tuttle a designer of the amanresorts there is also a  million house in palm beach florida and a fleet of aircraft a gulfstream iv a helicopter and a boeing  replete with trading room on which epstein recently flew president clinton actors chris tucker and kevin spacey supermarket magnate ron burkle lew wasserman’s grandson casey wasserman and a few others on a mission to explore the problems of aids and economic development in africaepstein is charming but he doesn’t let the charm slip into his eyes they are steely and calculating giving some hint at the steady whir of machinery running behind them “let’s play chess” he said to me after refusing to give an interview for this article “you be white you get the first move” it was an appropriate metaphor for a man who seems to feel he can win no matter what the advantage of the other side his advantage is that no one really seems to know him or his history completely or what his arsenal actually consists of he has carefully engineered it so that he remains one of the few truly baffling mysteries among new york’s moneyed world people know snippets but few know the whole“he’s very enigmatic” says rosa monckton the former ceo of tiffany  co in the uk and a close friend since the early s “you think you know him and then you peel off another ring of the onion skin and there’s something else extraordinary underneath he never reveals his hand… he’s a classic iceberg what you see is not what you get”even acquaintances sense a curious dichotomy yes he lives like a “modern maharaja” as leah kleman one of his art dealers puts it yet he is fastidiously almost obsessively private—he lists himself in the phone book under a pseudonym he rarely attends society gatherings or weddings or funerals he considers eating in restaurants like “eating on the subway”—ie something he’d never do there are many women in his life mostly young but there is no one of them to whom he has been able to commit he describes his most public companion of the last decade ghislaine maxwell  the daughter of the late disgraced media baron robert maxwell as simply his “best friend” he says she is not on his payroll but she seems to organize much of his life—recently she was making telephone inquiries to find a californiabased yoga instructor for him epstein is still close to his two other longterm girlfriends paula heil fisher a former associate of his at the brokerage firm bear stearns and now an opera producer and eva andersson dubin a doctor and onetime model he tells people that when a relationship is over the girlfriend “moves up not down” to friendship statussome of the businessmen who dine with him at his home—they include newspaper publisher mort zuckerman banker louis ranieri revlon chairman ronald perelman realestate tycoon leon black former microsoft executive nathan myhrvold tom pritzker of hyatt hotels and realestate personality donald trump—sometimes seem not all that clear as to what he actually does to earn his millions certainly you won’t find epstein’s transactions written about on bloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms “the trading desks don’t seem to know him it’s unusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow” says a highlevel investment managerunlike such fund managers as george soros and stanley druckenmiller whose client lists and stock maneuverings act as their calling cards epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret bar one client billionaire leslie wexner the respected chairman of limited brands epstein insists that ever since he left bear stearns in  he has managed money only for billionaires—who depend on him for discretion “i was the only person crazy enough or arrogant enough or misplaced enough to make my limit a billion dollars or more” he tells people freely according to him the flat fees he receives from his clients combined with his skill at playing the currency markets “with very large sums of money” have afforded him the lifestyle he enjoys todaywhy do billionaires choose him as their trustee because the problems of the megarich he tells people are different from yours and mine and his unique philosophy is central to understanding those problems “very few people need any more money when they have a billion dollars the key is not to have it do harm more than anything else… you don’t want to lose your money”he has likened his job to that of an architect—more specifically one who specializes in remodeling “i always describe a billionaire as someone who started out in a small home and as he became wealthier had addons he added on another addition he built a room over the garage … until you have a house that is usually a mess… it’s a large house that has been put together over time where no one could foretell the financial future and their accompanying needs”he makes it sound as though his job combines the roles of realestate agent accountant lawyer money manager trustee and confidant but as with jay gatsby myths and rumor swirl around epsteinhere are some of the hard facts about epstein—ones that he doesn’t mind people knowing he grew up middleclass in brooklyn his father worked for the city’s parks department his parents viewed education as “the way out” for him and his younger brother mark now working in real estate jeffrey started to play the piano—for which he maintains a passion—at five and he went to brooklyn’s lafayette high school he was good at mathematics and in his early s he got a job teaching physics and math at dalton the elite manhattan private school while there he began tutoring the son of bear stearns chairman ace greenberg and was friendly with a daughter of greenberg’s soon he went to bear stearns where under the mentorship of both greenberg and current bear stearns ceo james cayne he did well enough to become a limited partner—a rung beneath full partner he abruptly departed in  because he has said he wanted to run his own businessthereafter the details recede into shadow a few of the handful of current friends who have known him since the early s recall that he used to tell them he was a “bounty hunter” recovering lost or stolen money for the government or for very rich people he has a license to carry a firearm for the last  years he’s been running his business j epstein  cosince leslie wexner appeared in his life—epstein has said this was in  others say it was in  at the earliest—he has gradually in a way that has not generally made headlines come to be accepted by the establishment he’s a member of various commissions and councils he is on the trilateral commission the council on foreign relations the new york academy of sciences and the institute of international educationhis current fan club extends to cayne henry rosovsky the former dean of harvard’s faculty of arts and sciences and larry summers harvard’s current president harvard law professor alan dershowitz says “i’m on my th book… the only person outside of my immediate family that i send drafts to is jeffrey” realestate developer and philanthropist marshall rose who has worked with epstein on projects in new albany ohio for wexner says “he digests and decodes the information very rapidly which is to me terrific because we have shorter meetings”also on the list of admirers are former senator george mitchell and a gaggle of distinguished scientists most of whom epstein has helped fund in recent years they include nobel prize winners gerald edelman and murray gellmann and mathematical biologist martin nowak when these men describe epstein they talk about “energy” and “curiosity” as well as a love for theoretical physics that they don’t ordinarily find in laymen gellmann rather sweetly mentions that “there are always pretty ladies around” when he goes to dinner chez epstein and he’s under the impression that epstein’s clients include the queen of england both nowak and dershowitz were thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand of a man named “andrew” in epstein’s house “andrew” turned out to be prince andrew who subsequently arranged to sit in the back of dershowitz’s law classepstein gets annoyed when anyone suggests that wexner “made him” “i had really rich clients before” he has said yet he does not deny that he and wexner have a special relationship epstein sees it as a partnership of equals “people have said it’s like we have one brain between two of us each has a side”“i think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns” says wexner “but jeffrey sees patterns in politics and financial markets and i see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends my skills are not in investment strategy and as everyone who knows jeffrey knows his are not in fashion and design we frequently discuss world trends as each of us sees them”by the time epstein met wexner the latter was a retail legend who had built a  billion empire—one that now includes victoria’s secret express and bath  body works—from  lent him by his aunt “wexner saw in jeffrey the type of person who had the potential to realize his jeffrey’s dreams” says someone who has worked closely with both men “he gave jeffrey the ball and jeffrey hit it out of the park”wexner through a trust bought the town house in which epstein now lives for a reported  million in  in  wexner married abigail koppel a yearold lawyer and the newlyweds relocated to ohio in  epstein moved into the town house public documents suggest that the house is still owned by the trust that bought it but epstein has said that he now owns the housewexner trusts epstein so completely that he has assigned him the power of fiduciary over all of his private trusts and foundations says a source close to wexner in  epstein even persuaded wexner to put him on the board of the wexner foundation in place of wexner’s ailing mother bella wexner recovered and demanded to be reinstated epstein has said they settled by splitting the foundation in twoepstein does not care that he comes between family members in fact he sees it as his job he tells people “i am there to represent my client and if my client needs protecting—sometimes even from his own family—then it’s often better that people hate me not the client”“you’ve probably heard i’m vicious in my representation of my clients” he tells people proudly leah kleman describes his haggling over art prices as something like a scene out of the movie mad max beyond thunderdome even a former mentor says he’s seen “the dark side” of epstein and a bear stearns source recalls a meeting in which epstein chewed out a team making a presentation for wexner as being so brutal as to be “irresponsible”one reporter in fact received three threats from epstein while preparing a piece they were delivered in a jocular tone but the message was clear there will be trouble for your family if i don’t like the articleon the other hand epstein is clearly very generous with friends joe pagano an aspenbased venture capitalist who has known epstein since before his bear stearns days can’t say enough nice things “i have a boy who’s dyslexic and jeffrey’s gotten close to him over the years… jeffrey got him into music he bought him his first piano and then as he got to school he had difficulty … in studying … so jeffrey got him interested in taking flying lessons”rosa monckton recalls epstein telling her that her daughter domenica who suffers from down syndrome needed the sun and that rosa should feel free to bring her to his house in palm beach anytimesome friends remember that in the late s epstein would offer to upgrade the airline tickets of good friends by affixing firstclass stickers the only problem was that the stickers turned out to be unofficial sometimes the technique worked but other times it didn’t and the unwitting recipients found themselves exiled to coach epstein has claimed that he paid for the upgrades and had no knowledge of the stickers many of those who benefited from epstein’s largesse claim that his generosity comes with no strings attached “i never felt he wanted anything from me in return” says one old friend who received a firstclass upgradeepstein is known about town as a man who loves women—lots of them mostly young model types have been heard saying they are full of gratitude to epstein for flying them around and he is a familiar face to many of the victoria’s secret girls one young woman recalls being summoned by ghislaine maxwell to a concert at epstein’s town house where the women seemed to outnumber the men by far “these were not women you’d see at upper east side dinners” the woman recalls “many seemed foreign and dressed a little bizarrely” this same guest also attended a cocktail party thrown by maxwell that prince andrew attended which was filled she says with young russian models “some of the guests were horrified” the woman says“he’s reckless” says a former business associate “and he’s gotten more so money does that to you he’s breaking the oath he made to himself—that he would never do anything that would expose him in the media right now in the wake of the publicity following his trip with clinton he must be in a very difficult place”according to sec and other legal documents unearthed by vanity fair epstein may have good reason to keep his past cloaked in secrecy his real mentor it might seem was not leslie wexner but steven jude hoffenberg  who for a few months before the sec sued to freeze his assets in  was trying to buy the new york post he is currently incarcerated in the federal medical center in devens massachusetts serving a year sentence for bilking investors out of more than  million in one of the largest ponzi schemes in american historywhen epstein met hoffenberg in london in the s the latter was the charismatic audacious head of the towers financial corporation a collection agency that was supposed to buy debts that people owed to hospitals banks and phone companies but hoffenberg began using company funds to pay off earlier investors and service a lavish lifestyle that included a mansion on long island homes on manhattan’s sutton place and in florida and a fleet of cars and planeshoffenberg and epstein had much in common both were smart and obsessed with making money both were from brooklyn according to hoffenberg the two men were introduced by douglas leese a defense contractor epstein has said they were introduced by john mitchell the late attorney generalepstein had been running international assets group inc iag a consulting company out of his apartment in the solo building on east th street in new york though he has claimed that he managed money for billionaires only in a  deposition he testified that he spent  percent of his time assisting people recover stolen money from fraudulent brokers and lawyers he was also not above entering into risky taxsheltered oil and gas deals with much smaller investors a lawsuit that michael stroll the former head of williams electronics inc filed against epstein shows that in  iag received an investment from stroll of  which epstein put into oil in  stroll asked for his money back four years later he had received only  stroll lost the suit after epstein claimed in court among other things that the check for  was for a horse he’d bought from stroll “my net worth never exceeded four and a half million dollars” stroll has saidhoffenberg says a close friend “really liked jeffrey… jeffrey has a way of getting under your skin and he was under hoffenberg’s” also appealing to hoffenberg were epstein’s social connections they included oil mogul cece wang father of the designer vera and mohan murjani whose clothing company grew into gloria vanderbilt jeans epstein lived large even then one friend recalls that when he took canadian heiress wendy belzberg on a date he hired a rollsroyce especially for the occasion epstein has claimed he owned itin  hoffenberg according to sources set epstein up in the offices he still occupies in the villard house on madison avenue across a courtyard from the restaurant le cirque hoffenberg hired his new protégé as a consultant at  a month and the relationship flourished “they traveled everywhere together—on hoffenberg’s plane all around the world they were always together” says a source hoffenberg has claimed that epstein confided in him saying for example that he had left bear stearns in  after he was discovered executing “illegal operations”several of epstein’s bear stearns contemporaries recall that epstein left the company very suddenly within the company there were rumors also that he was involved in a technical infringement and it was thought that the executive committee asked that he resign after his two supporters ace greenberg and jimmy cayne were outnumbered greenberg says he can’t recall this cayne denies it happened and epstein has denied it as well “jeffrey epstein left bear stearns of his own volition” says cayne “it was never suggested that he leave by any member of management and management never looked into any improprieties by him jeffrey said specifically ‘i don’t want to work for anybody else i want to work for myself’” yet this is not the story that epstein told to the sec in  and to lawyers in a  deposition involving a civil business case in philadelphiain  the sec’s jonathan harris and robert blackburn took epstein’s testimony and that of other bear stearns employees in part of what became a protracted case about insider trading around a tender offer placed on march   by the seagram company ltd for st joe minerals corp ultimately several italian and swiss investors were found guilty including italian financier giuseppe tome who had used his relationship with seagram owner edgar bronfman sr to obtain information about the tender offerafter the tender offer was announced the sec began investigating trades involving st joe at bear stearns and other firms epstein resigned from bear stearns on march  the sec was tipped off that epstein had information on insider trading at bear stearns and it was therefore obliged to question him in his sec testimony given on april   epstein claimed that he had found “offensive” the way bear stearns management had handled a disciplinary action following its discovery that he had committed a possible “reg d” violation—evidently he had lent money to his closest friend in the  deposition he said that he’d lent approximately  to warren eisenstein to buy stock such an action could have been considered improper although epstein claimed he had not realized this until afterwardaccording to epstein bear stearns management had questioned him about the loan around march  the questioners epstein said were michael mickey tarnopol and alvin einbender in his  deposition epstein recalled that the partner who had made an “issue” of the matter was marvin davidson on march  epstein said he had met with tarnopol and einbender again and the two partners told him that the executive committee had weighed the offense together with previous “carelessness” over expenses and he would be fined “there was discussion whether in fact i had ever put in an airline ticket for someone else and not myself and i said that it was possible … since my secretary handles my expenses” epstein told the sec in his  testimony he stated that the “reg d” incident had cost him a shot at partnership that yearwhat the sec seemed to be especially interested in was whether there was a connection between epstein’s leaving and the alleged insider trading in st joe minerals by other people at bear stearnsq sir are you aware that certain rumors may have been circulating around your firm in connection with your reasons for leaving the firma i’m aware that there were many rumorsq what were the rumors you hearda nothing to do with st joeq can you relate what you hearda it was having to do with an illicit affair with a secretaryq have you heard any other rumors suggesting that you had made a presentation or communication to the executive committee concerning alleged improprieties by other members or employees of bear stearnsa i in fact have heard that rumor but it’s been from mr harris in our conversation last weekq have you heard it from anyone elsea noa little later the interview focuses on james cayneq did you ever hear while you were at bear stearns that mr cayne may have trader or insider information in connection with st joe minerals corporationq did mr cayne ever have any conversation with you about st joe mineralsq did you happen to overhear any conversations between mr cayne and anyone else regarding st joe mineralsand still later in the questioning comes this exchangeq have you had any type of business dealings with mr caynea there’s no relationship with bear stearnsq pardona other than bear stearns noq have you been a participant in any type of business venture with mr cayneq do you have any expectation of participating in any business venture with mr cayneq have you had any business participations with mr therama no nor do i anticipate anyq mr epstein did anyone at bear stearns tell you in words or substance that you should not divulge anything about st joe minerals to the staff of the securities and exchange commissionq has anyone indicated to you in any way either directly or indirectly in words or substance that your compensation for this past year or any future monies coming to you from bear stearns will be contingent upon your not divulging information to the securities and exchange commissiona nodespite the circumstances of epstein’s leaving bear stearns agreed to pay him his annual bonus—which he anticipated as being approximately the sec never brought any charges against anyone at bear stearns for insider trading in st joe but its questioning seems to indicate that it was skeptical of epstein’s answers some sources have wondered why if he was such a big producer at bear stearns he would have given it up over a mere  finecertainly the years after epstein left the firm were not obviously prosperous ones his luck didn’t seem to change until he met hoffenbergone of epstein’s first assignments for hoffenberg was to mastermind doomed bids to take over pan american world airways in  and emery air freight corp in  hoffenberg claimed in a  hearing before a grand jury in illinois that epstein came up with the idea of financing these bids through towers’s acquisition of two ailing illinois insurance companies associated life and united fire “he was hired by us to work on the securities side of the insurance companies and towers financial supposedly to make a profit for us and for the companies” hoffenberg reportedly told the grand jury he also alleged that epstein was the “technician” executing the schemes although having no broker’s license he had to rely on others to make the trades much of hoffenberg’s subsequent testimony in his criminal case has proven to be false and epstein has claimed he was merely asked how the bids could be accomplished and has said he had nothing to do with the financing of them yet richard allen the former treasurer of united fire recalls seeing epstein two or three times at the company he and another executive say they had direct dealing with epstein over the finances and in his deposition of  epstein stated that he was the one who executed “all” hoffenberg’s instructions to buy and sell the stock he called it “making the orders” he could not recall whether he had chosen the brokers usedto win approval from the illinois insurance regulators for towers’s acquisition of the companies hoffenberg promised to inject  million of new capital into them in fact in his grandjury testimony hoffenberg claimed that he his chief operating officer mitchell brater and epstein came up with a scheme to steal  million of the insurance companies’ bonds to buy pan am and emery stock “jeffrey epstein and mitch brater arranged the various brokerage accounts for the bonds to be placed with in new york and i think one in chicago rodman  renshaw” hoffenberg reportedly said then said hoffenberg while making it appear as though they were investing the bonds in much safer financial instruments they used them as collateral to buy the stock “epstein was the person in charge of the transactions and mitchell brater was assisting him with it in coordination on behalf of the insurance companies’ money” hoffenberg claimed at the timeat one point according to hoffenberg a broker forged the documents necessary for a  million check to be written on insurancecompany funds the check was used to buy more stock in the takeover targets meanwhile in order to throw the insurance regulators off the  million was reported as being safely invested in a moneymarket accountunited fire’s former chief financial officer daniel payton confirms part of hoffenberg’s account he says he recalls making one or two telephone calls to epstein at hoffenberg’s direction about the missing bonds “he said ‘oh yeah they still exist’ but we found out later that he had sold those assets … leveraged them … and used some margin account to take some positions in … emery and pan am” says paytonepstein’s extraordinary creativity was according to hoffenberg responsible for the purchase by the insurance companies of a  bond with no money down “epstein created a great scheme to purchase a  treasury bond that would not be shown … as margined or collateralized” he reportedly told the grand jury “it looked like it was free and clear but it actually wasn’t” he saidepstein has denied he ever had any dealings with anyone from the insurance companies but richard allen says he recalls talking to epstein at hoffenberg’s direction and telling him it was urgent they retrieve the missing bonds for a state examination according to allen epstein said “we’ll get them back” he had “kind of a flippant attitude” says allen “they never came back”epstein according to hoffenberg also came up with a scheme to manipulate the price of emery freight stock in an attempt to minimize the losses that occurred when hoffenberg’s bid went wrong and the share price began to fall this was alleged to have involved multiple clients’ accounts controlled by epsteineventually in  insurance regulators in illinois sued hoffenberg he settled the case and epstein who was only a paid consultant was never deposed or accused of any wrongdoing barry gross the attorney who was handling the suit for the regulators says of epstein “he was very elusive… it was hard to really track him down there were a substantial number of checks for significant dollars that were paid to him i remember… he was this character we never got a handle on again we presumed that he was involved with the pan am and emery run that hoffenberg made but we never got a chance to depose him”“from the government’s discovery in the main sentencing against hoffenberg it would seem the government was perhaps a bit lazy” says david lewis who represented mitchell brater “they went for what they knew they could get … and that was the fraudulent promissory notes ie the much larger and unrelated part of hoffenberg’s fraud based in new york state… what they couldn’t get they didn’t bother with”another lawyer involved in the criminal prosecution of hoffenberg says “in a criminal investigation like that when there is a guilty plea to be quick and dirty about it discovery is always incomplete… they don’t have to line up witnesses they don’t have to learn every fact that might come out on crossexamination”epstein was involved with hoffenberg in other questionable transactions financial records show that in  epstein invested  million in riddell sports inc a company that manufactures football helmets among his coinvestors were the theater mogul robert nederlander and attorney leonard toboroff a source close to this transaction claims that epstein told nederlander and toboroff that he had raised his share of the money from a swiss banker whose identity they could not be allowed to know but hoffenberg has claimed the money came from him and towers’s financial statements for that year show a loan to epstein of  epstein has said he can’t remember the details and has disputed the accuracy of the towers financial reportsaround the same time nederlander and toboroff let epstein come in with them on a scheme to make money out of pennwalt a pennsylvania chemical company the plan was to group together with two other parties to take a substantial declared position in the stock according to a source epstein was supposed to help nederlander and toboroff raise  million he seemed to fail to find other investors say those familiar with the deal epstein has said he was merely an investor he invested  million which he told his coinvestors was his own money but in his  deposition he said that he put in only  of his own money where did the rest come from hoffenberg has said it came from him in a loan that nederlander and toboroff didn’t know abouttwo things happened that alarmed nederlander and toboroff after the group signaled a possible takeover the pennwalt management threatened to sue the wouldbe raiders epstein was reluctant initially to give a deposition about his share of the money telling toboroff there were “reasons” he didn’t want to then after the opportunity for new investors was closed coinvestors recall epstein announcing that he’d found one at last dick snyder then ceo of the publisher simon  schuster who wanted to put up approximately  neither epstein nor snyder can now recall the investment yet in the  deposition epstein said that he had recruited snyder whom he had met socially into the dealaccording to a source toboroff and nederlander told epstein that snyder was too late but without their realizing it hoffenberg has claimed snyder wrote a check to hoffenberg and bought out some of his investment but then snyder wanted out“nederlander started to get these irate calls from snyder who wasn’t part of the deal saying he was owed all this money” says someone close to the deal toboroff and nederlander were baffledeventually a source close to hoffenberg says hoffenberg paid snyder offjust as nederlander and toboroff were growing wary of epstein he became increasingly involved with leslie wexner whom he had met through insurance executive robert meister and his late wife epstein has told people that he met wexner in  in palm beach and that he won his confidence by persuading him not to invest in the stock market just as the  crash was approaching his story has subsequently changed when asked if wexner knew about his connection to hoffenberg epstein said that he began working for wexner in  and that “it was certainly not the same time”wherever and whenever it was that epstein and wexner actually met there was an immediate and strong personal chemistry wexner says he thinks epstein is “very smart with a combination of excellent judgment and unusually high standards also he is always a most loyal friend”sources say epstein proved that he could be useful to wexner as well with “fresh” ideas about investments “wexner had a couple of bad investments and jeffrey cleaned those up right away” says a former associate of epstein’sbefore he signed on with wexner epstein had several meetings with harold levin then head of wexner investments in which he enunciated ideas about currencies that levin found incomprehensible “in fact” says someone who used to work very closely with wexner “almost everyone at the limited wondered who epstein was he literally came out of nowhere”“everyone was mystified as to what his appeal was” says robert morosky a former vicechairman of the limitedmuch of epstein’s work is related to cleaning up tightening budgets and efficiencies one person who worked for wexner and who saw a contract drawn up between the two men says epstein is involved in “everything not just a little here a little there everything” in addition he says “wexner likes having a hatchet man… whenever there is dirty work to be done he’d stick jeffrey on it… he has a reputation for being ruthless but he gets the job done”epstein has evidently been asked to fire personalstaff members when needed “he was that mysterious person that everyone was scared to death of” says a former employeemeanwhile he is also less than popular with some people outside wexner’s company with whom he now deals “he ‘inserted’ himself into the construction process of leslie wexner’s yacht… that resulted in litigation down the road between mr wexner and the shipyard that eventually built the vessel” says lars forsberg a lawyer whose firm at the time dickerson and reily was hired to deal with litigation stemming from the construction of wexner’s limitless—at  feet one of the largest private yachts in the world evidently epstein stalled on paying dickerson and reily for its work “it’s probably once or twice in my legal career that i’ve had to sue a client for payment of services that he’d requested and we’d performed … without issue on the performance” says forsberg in the end the matter was settled but epstein claims he now has no recollection of itthe incident is one of a number of disputes epstein has become embroiled in some are for sums so tiny as to be baffling for instance epstein sued investment adviser herbert glass who sold him the palm beach house in  for —epstein claimed this was owed him for furnishings removed by glassin  the us attorney’s office sued epstein for illegally subletting the former home of the deputy consul general of iran to attorney ivan fisher and others epstein paid  a month in rent to the state department but he charged fisher and his colleagues  though the exact terms of the agreement are sealed the court ruled against epsteinwexner offers some insight into his friend’s combative style “many times people confuse winning and losing” wexner says “jeffrey has the unusual quality of knowing when he is winning whether in conversations or negotiations he always stands back and lets the other person determine the style and manner of the conversation or negotiation and then he responds in their style jeffrey sees it in chivalrous terms he does not pick a fight but if there is a fight he will let you choose your weapon”one case is rather more serious currently citibank is suing epstein for defaulting on loans from its privatebanking arm for  million epstein claims that citibank “fraudulently induced” him into borrowing the money for investments citibank disputes this chargethe legal papers for another case offer a rare window into epstein’s finances in  epstein stopped paying rent to his landlord the nonprofit municipal arts society for his office in the villard house he claimed that they were breaking the terms of the lease by not letting his staff in at night the case was eventually settled however one of the papers filed in this dispute is epstein’s financial statement for  in which he claimed to be worth  million he listed that he owned  million in securities  million in cash zero in residential property although he told sources that he had already bought the home in palm beach and  million in other assets including his investment in riddell a coinvestor in riddell says “the company had been bought with a huge amount of debt and it wasn’t public so it was meaningless to attach a figure like that to it … the price it cost was about  million” the coinvestors bought out epstein’s share in riddell in  for approximately  million at that time when epstein was asked as a routine matter to sign a paper guaranteeing he had access to a few million dollars in case of any subsequent disputes over the sale price wexner signed for him epstein has explained that this was because the coinvestors wanted an indemnity against being sued by wexner one of the investors calls this “bullshit”epstein’s appointment to the board of new york’s rockefeller university in  brought him into greater social prominence boasting such social names as nancy kissinger brooke astor and robert bass the board also includes such preeminent scientists as nobel laureate joseph goldstein “epstein was thrilled to be elected” says someone who knows himafter one term epstein resigned according to new york magazine this was because he didn’t like to wear a suit to meetings a spokesperson for the rockefeller board says epstein left because he had insufficient time to commit a board member recalls that he was “arrogant” and “not a good fit” the spokesperson admits that it is “infrequent” for board members not to be renominated after only one termstill the recent spate of publicity epstein has inspired does not seem to have fazed him in november he was spotted in the front row of the victoria’s secret fashion show at new york’s lexington avenue armory around the same time the usual coterie of friends and beautiful women were whisked off to little st james which he tells people has been renamed little st jeff for a long weekendthanks to epstein’s introductions says martin nowak the biologist finds himself moving from princeton to harvard where he is assuming the joint position of professor of mathematics and professor of biology epstein has pledged at least  million to harvard to create the epstein program for mathematical biology and evolutionary dynamics and epstein will have an office at the university the program will be dedicated to searching for nature’s algorithms a pursuit that is a specialty of nowak’s for epstein this must be the summit of everything he has worked toward he has been seen proudly displaying harvard president larry summers’s letter of commitment as if he can’t quite believe it is real he says he was reluctant to have his name attached to the program but summers persuaded him he rang his mentor wexner about it and wexner told him it was all rightan insatiable restless soul always on the move epstein builds a tremendous amount of downtime into his hectic work schedule yet there is something almost programmed about his relaxation it’s as if even pleasure has to be measured in terms of selfimprovement nowak says that when he goes to stay with epstein in the caribbean they’ll get up at six and as the sun rises have threehour conversations about theoretical physics “then he’ll go off and do some work reappear and we’ll talk some more”another person who went to the island with epstein maxwell and several beautiful women remembers that the women “sat around one night teasing him about the kinds of grasping women who might want to date him he was amused by the idea… he’s like a king in his own world”many people comment there is something innocent almost childlike about jeffrey epstein they see this as refreshing given the sophistication of his surroundings alan dershowitz says that as he was getting to know epstein his wife asked him if he would still be close to him if epstein suddenly filed for bankruptcy dershowitz says he replied “absolutely i would be as interested in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in coney island and talked about his ideas”shareemailfacebooktwitteryou might likehas trump finally entered the death spiralvanity fairhow russia

andrew r have all been known to spend time with the billionaire reuters ap world jeffrey epstein sex crimes british royal family even by the standards of the british royal family the case of prince andrew and the underage sex slave is a peculiar one an american woman called virginia roberts – now a married yearold mother of three – has filed an affidavit in a florida federal court in which she swears in gruesome detail that the late press baron and pension fiddler robert maxwell’s daughter ghislaine recruited her to satisfy the sexual needs of billionaire financier jeffrey epstein and his friends those friends according to roberts included the duke of york now fifth in line to the throne and celebrity lawyer alan dershowitz best known for getting claus von bulow’s conviction for

nickname the “lolita express” – on an unsavoury kind of world tour that included she says an orgy with andrew on epstein’s private island of little st james or “little st jeff” as it became knownone of the many extraordinary things about this sordid story that jackie collins would blush to create – aside from the fact that andrew chose to refer to it at the world economic forum in davos of all places but then was unable to keep his cool when asked if he would be making a statement under oath he walked out of the room without answering – is that andrew would be friends with jeffrey epstein in the first place but then again as both bill clinton and stephen hawking have been to little st james as part of epstein’s circle he was hardly alone daily emails and alerts  get the best of newsweek delivered to your inboxaround epstein the question hovers who exactly is this man who makes such powerful friends and how does he do itthe yearold registered sex offender comes from a gritty background in brooklyn with no university degree and no clear explanation for his many millions as he mixes with princes and premiers and lives in multiple mansions his web runs wide and deep in politics science academia and business as well as royaltysome presidents and princes having acquired a taste for the trappings of high office or monarchy find it hard to resist the allure of the private jet there were obviously other attractions for prince andrew and bill clinton – the private island in the caribbean described by former staff as “like a five star hotel where nobody paid” the pretty girls offering massages the ontap chat about theoretical physics – but with his  flying hours a year to play with usually with guests on board – epstein had a lot of flight leverage which is why in this unseemly saga just as prince andrew is being forced to issue what feel like daily denials about accusations of having sex with an underage girl at mr epstein’s many houses eye­popping names surface in the caribbean sea stephen hawking attending a conference paid for by epstein was pictured at a barbecue on the “island of sin” as it has become known with him in one picture were david gross an american physicist and nobel laureate and harvard professor called lisa randall two other nobel laureates gerard t’hooft and frank wilczek have visited too as has professor lawrence krauss and on other occasions his great friend scientist martin nowak who moved from princeton to harvard and with whose research he has funded epstein mixes with the elite of the science world because he was a calculus and physics teacher born and raised in coney island he attended some classes in physics and mathematical physiology of the heart though he never graduated from anywhere when he taught at dalton school a private school in new york between  part of the epstein mythology goes a parent was so impressed with his dead poets societytype enthusiasm mathematical ability and imagination that he suggested he move to wall street so after a stint at bear stearns he became a financial advisor to the extremely rich – it was said that only billionaires need apply – though only one client les wexner owner of victoria’s secret was known by name his friends would always insist he was incredibly clever and freethinking while others find him “arrogant” and “awkward”within a matter of years the schoolteacherturnedtycoon was living the life of the american billionaire with a villa in palm beach a ranch in new mexico an apartment in paris as well as little st james and what looks like the largest private house in new york last time i walked past it in the snow the pavements were covered with ice everywhere apart from outside his house the pavement is heated to make sure they never freeze over but even amongst this extreme wealth and luxury the financier in casual clothes – he never wears a suit – was never a high profile socialite or keen on much interaction then ghislaine maxwell came into his life where epstein might gravitate towards scientists she served up prince andrew as it were in whose circles she’d mixed for years thus it was that epstein and maxwell went shooting at sandringham epstein could talk science for hours but his manners were unusual in a host – staff on little st james said he only picked at food never drank and got up at dawn whereas ghislaine had her father’s bombastic charisma leaving aside the question of whether she served as his madam and joined in the underage sex herself as has been alleged she certainly oiled the social wheels for him so in little st james lord mandelson and his boyfriend reinaldo came to visit other friends included donald trump and kevin spaceyfor years the court of jeffrey epstein courtesy of ghislaine maxwell was thriving with the powerbrokers thinkers and players but as one who knew them both for years says “ghislaine used the fact she knew other powerful people to seduce powerful people
