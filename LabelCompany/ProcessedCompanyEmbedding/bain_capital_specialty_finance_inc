investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated fund and affiliated fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of the regulated fund has approved that regulated funds participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best

investment transaction with any affiliated fund or regulated fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent regulated fund for purposes of section a and rule d applicants request that each whollyowned investment sub be permitted to participate in coinvestment transactions in lieu of its parent regulated fund and that the whollyowned investment sub’s participation in any such transaction be treated for purposes of the requested order as though the parent regulated fund were participating directly applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a whollyowned investment sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the regulated fund’s investments and therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the regulated fund’s board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned  all existing entities that currently intend to rely upon

fund proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment subs the board will also be informed of and take into consideration the relative participation of the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub  when considering potential coinvestment transactions for any regulated fund the applicable adviser will consider only the objectives and strategies investment policies investment positions capital available for investment and other pertinent factors applicable to that regulated fund the regulated fund advisers expect that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a regulated fund should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification   other than pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the board eligible to vote under section o of the act “eligible directors” and the “required majority” as defined in section o of the act “required majority”  will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating regulated fund  the regulated funds however will not be obligated to invest or coinvest when investment opportunities are referred to them  in the case of a regulated fund that is a registered closedend fund the board members that make up the required majority will be determined as if the regulated fund were a bdc subject to section o   with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated fund and affiliated fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of the regulated fund has approved that regulated fund’s participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated fund if the board does not so approve any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to the regulated fund’s eligible directors the board of any regulated fund may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors  no noninterested director of a regulated fund will have a financial interest in any coinvestment transaction other than through share ownership in one of the regulated funds applicants’ legal analysis  section a of the act prohibits certain affiliated persons of a bdc from participating in joint transactions with the bdc or a company controlled by a bdc in contravention of rules as prescribed by the commission under section b of the act any person who is directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with a bdc is subject to section a applicants submit that each of the regulated funds and affiliated funds be deemed to be a person related to each regulated fund in a manner described by section b by virtue of being under common control section i of the act provides that until the commission prescribes rules under section a the commission’s rules under section d of the act  applicable to registered closedend investment companies will be deemed to apply to transactions subject to section a because the commission has not adopted any rules under section a rule d also applies to joint transactions with regulated funds that are bdcs section d of the act and rule d under the act are applicable to regulated funds that are registered closedend investment companies  section d of the act and rule d under the act prohibit affiliated persons of a registered investment company from participating in joint transactions with the company unless the commission has granted an order permitting such transactions in passing upon applications under rule d the commission considers whether the company’s participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief the regulated funds would be in some circumstances limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities applicants believe that the proposed terms and conditions will ensure that the coinvestment transactions are consistent with the protection of each regulated fund’s shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the act applicants state that the regulated funds’ participation in the coinvestment transactions will be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants also represent that if the advisers certain employees and principals of bain and its affiliated advisers collectively the “principals” any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the advisers or the principals and the affiliated funds collectively the “holders” own in the aggregate more than  percent of the outstanding voting  securities of a regulated fund “shares” then the holders will vote such shares as required under condition  applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the noninterested directors will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of the advisers or the principals to influence the noninterested directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the noninterested directors can be removed will be limited significantly applicants represent that the noninterested directors will evaluate and approve any such independent party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant applicants’ conditions applicants agree that the order will be subject to the following conditions  each time an adviser considers a potential coinvestment transaction for an affiliated fund or another regulated fund that falls within a regulated fund’s thencurrent objectives and strategies the regulated fund’s adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for such regulated fund in light of the regulated fund’s thencurrent circumstances  a if the adviser deems a regulated fund’s participation in any potential co investment transaction to be appropriate for the regulated fund it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the regulated fund b if the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable adviser to be invested by the applicable regulated fund in the potential coinvestment transaction together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating regulated funds and affiliated funds collectively in the same transaction exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant’s capital  available for investment in the asset class being allocated up to the amount proposed to be invested by each the applicable adviser will provide the eligible directors of each participating regulated fund with information concerning each participating party’s available capital to assist the eligible directors with their review of the regulated fund’s investments for compliance with these allocation procedures c after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the applicable adviser will distribute written information concerning the potential coinvestment transaction including the amount proposed to be invested by each participating regulated fund and affiliated fund to the eligible directors of each participating regulated fund for their consideration a regulated fund will coinvest with one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds only if prior to the regulated fund’s participation in the potential co investment transaction a required majority concludes that i the terms of the potential coinvestment transaction including the consideration to be paid are reasonable and fair to the regulated fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the regulated fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned ii the potential coinvestment transaction is consistent with a the interests of the shareholders of the regulated fund and b the regulated fund’s thencurrent objectives and strategies iii the investment by any other regulated funds or affiliated funds would not disadvantage the regulated fund and participation by the regulated fund would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other regulated funds or affiliated funds provided that if any other regulated fund or affiliated fund but not the regulated  fund itself gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company’s board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the required majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition ciii if a the eligible directors will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer if any b the applicable adviser agrees to and does provide periodic reports to the regulated fund’s board with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company and c any fees or other compensation that any affiliated fund or any regulated fund or any affiliated person of any affiliated fund or any regulated fund receives in connection with the right of an affiliated fund or a regulated fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating affiliated funds who each may in turn share its portion with its affiliated persons and the participating regulated funds in accordance with the amount of each party’s investment and iv the proposed investment by the regulated fund will not benefit the advisers the affiliated funds or the other regulated funds or any affiliated person of any of them other than the parties to the coinvestment transaction except a to the extent permitted  by condition  b to the extent permitted by sections e or k of the act as applicable c indirectly as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the coinvestment transaction or d in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition ciiic  each regulated fund has the right to decline to participate in any potential co investment transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed  the applicable adviser will present to the board of each regulated fund on a quarterly basis a record of all investments in potential coinvestment transactions made by any of the other regulated funds or affiliated funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the regulated fund’s thencurrent objectives and strategies that were not made available to the regulated fund and an

applicable advisers will i notify each regulated fund that participated in the coinvestment transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time and ii formulate a recommendation as
