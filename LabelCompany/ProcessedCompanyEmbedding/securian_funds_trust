volatility equity investment approach available with securian’s variable annuity and life insurance products” said steve moen senior vice president of business development and investment solutions at advantus “managed volatility funds allow investors to maintain exposure to the equity markets with the potential for lower volatility” as market conditions change the effective equity exposure of the fund changes to manage volatility the equity allocation is adjusted primarily through the use of futures reducing equity exposure when markets are more volatile and increasing exposure when market volatility is low “our approach to managing volatility is straightforward” said moen “by adjusting the equity allocation investors don’t need to solely rely on moving dollars to fixed income to try to reduce risk” david kuplic cfa and craig stapleton cfa frm are the portfolio managers for the fund both investment professionals have demonstrated expertise and results leading similar managed

than when originally invested derivatives may be used to seek increased income or try to hedge investment risks in general terms a derivative investment’s value depends on or is derived from the value of an underlying asset interest rate or index options futures swaps structured notes currencies and certain mortgagerelated securities are examples derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the fund’s performance there is also a possibility that derivatives may not perform as intended which can reduce opportunity for gain or result in losses by offsetting positive returns in other securities in the portfolio rising interest rates will affect the performance of the fund’s investments in debt securities the ability of the fund’s equity securities to generate income is dependent on the earnings and the continuing declaration of dividends by the issuers of such securities the values of incomeproducing equity securities may or may not move in tandem with overall changes in the stock market liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell a portfolio’s investments in illiquid securities may reduce the returns of the portfolio because it may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price the fund engages in frequent trading of portfolio securities active trading results in added expenses and may result in a lower return and increased tax liability there can be no assurance that investment decisions made
