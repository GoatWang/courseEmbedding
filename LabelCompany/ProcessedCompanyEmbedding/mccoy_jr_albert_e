history architecture andor cultural importance the commission judges that the property known as the albert mccoy farm does possess special significance in terms of charlottemecklenburg the commission bases its judgment on the following considerations     the  albert mccoy farm is a physical reminder of the rural landscape of mecklenburg county in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  with its simple twostory  farm house and modest collection of outbuildings log crib a wellhouse a smokehouse and a privy the albert mccoy farm represents the many small farmsteads that flourished in the county in the decades after the civil war    the albert mccoy house is a twostory timberframe sidegableand wing dwelling representative of a type that was common throughout mecklenburg county in the late nineteenth century    the integrity of the albert mccoy house is excellent no original material has been removed since the house was constructed   b      integrity of design workmanship materials feeling and association the commission contends that the architectural description prepared by mr  william huffman and dr richard mattson demonstrates that the albert mccoy farm meets this criterion         ad valorem tax appraisal the commission is aware that designation would allow the owner to apply for an automatic deferral of  of the ad valorem taxes on all or any portion of the

date of preparation of this report november     provided by  united states department of the interior national park service national register of historic places continuation sheet interview with dr thomas h mccoy  aug  mecklenburg county deed book  p  deed book  p    physical description          the albert mccoy farm is located in the long creek section of northern mecklenburg county north carolina about fifteen miles north of the city of charlotte approximately five miles from the center of the town of huntersville it has recently been annexed into the rapidly expanding town limits the albert mccoy farm is entirely rural in character though it is in an area that is currently inundated by rapid development which is likely to increase even more when  charlotte�s outer beltway is completed             the long creek section of mecklenburg county is typical of the southern piedmont region of north carolina it is characterized by wellwatered gentlyrolling topography that is wellsuited for agricultural purposes typical vegetation includes open spaces pastures cultivated fields mature hardwood trees and piney woodlands the built environment reflects the traditional agricultural nature of the area in the scattered farms that remain but also exhibits the more current urban and suburban development patterns in subdivisions and freestanding dwellings             the albert mccoy farm has been in the same family since  and has been in continuous agricultural use since at least  it is a rural historic landscape which retains the setting characteristics and associations from the period of significance c  the centerpiece of the seventysix acre farm which spans both sides of mccoy road sr  is the c  albert mccoy house the house faces east outbuildings spread out on three sides to the north west and south of the house a typical layout for nineteenthcentury mecklenburg county farms the significant outbuildingsa log crib a wellhouse a smokehouse and a privy are contemporary with the house only a pumphouse and a small animal shelter are later the house is surrounded by a manicured yard shrubbery and scattered hardwood trees including oak elm sycamore poplar and walnut trees an unpaved driveway runs from mccoy road along the south side of the house and turns north into the back yard a small kitchen garden is beyond the driveway on the south side of the house pasture land and fields surround the house and yard on all sides and woodlands spread along the east and west sides and across the southwest corner of the tract a large manmade pond installed in the s for recreational use sits adjacent to the western edge of the property it is fed by a spring near gar creek which traverses the southern edge of the albert mccoy farm                the albert mccoy house is a twostory timber frame sidegableandwing sometimes called lplan dwelling on a stone pier foundation the roof has a shallow pitch cross gables and a standingseam metal covering the house is sheathed with weatherboard siding and has large sixoversix sash windows there are three brick chimneysone exterior end chimney and two interior chimneys the porch spans the left south two bays of the facade and features a hipped roof a cutwork balustrade and sawn brackets a onestory ell extends out from the rear of the house on the south side the handmade front door surround includes sidelights and splays out at the top and bottom the door surround is distinctive and along with the interior woodwork identifies this house as the product of local builder john ellis mcauley    front porch detail              on the interior the albert mccoy house has a center hall plan the openstring stair rises up from the back of the hall and features delicate turned balusters and thick turned newel posts the first floor has three large rooms in the main body of the house and two smaller rooms in the rear ell three large bedrooms are found on the second floor seven of the eight rooms have fireplaces with handcarved mantels each mantel is different from the others and all are recognizable as the work of john ellis mcauley  mcauley favored flat pilasters or chamfered boards supporting a plain shelf but created unique architraves he often used simple handcarved shapes but executed them well usually adding a deep bevel that varied in angle along the curves he created mcauley�s handiwork can also be seen in the boardandbatten ceiling coverings and his use of interior closets each of the three upstairs bedrooms has a small closet in one corner four panel doors with ornate victorian rim locks are found throughout the house all interior wall finishes are plaster and all floors are wide heartpine boards   the ephraim alexander mcauley house ca  the mcauley house was remodeled by john ellis mcauley in             the integrity of the albert mccoy house is excellent no original material has been removed since the house was constructed a bathroom was added off the first floor hall in the midtwentieth century at some point plumbing was added to the rear first floor room and it was converted to kitchen use   architectural description and architectural context                the albert mccoy house a twostory timberframe sidegableand wing dwelling is representative of a type that was common throughout mecklenburg county in the late nineteenth century   its irregular massing identifies its origins as queen anne whether or not any victorian trim was used in the house  this particular house does not contain any massproduced millwork or other trip typically associated with the queen anne style  instead it is a showplace for the individual and highly skilled craftsmanship of local builder john ellis mcauley   john ellis mcauley                   john ellis mcauley  is the only local builder in mecklenburg county about whom significant information is known  he was from a local family and ultimately inherited his father�s house and land on alexandriana road in the long creek area of the county mcauley displayed his carpentry skills as early as age twelve when he built a functioning miniature water mill that was widely admired by those who saw it  he had a special affection for tools and took pride in keeping them sharp his fourfootbythreefoot toolbox is said to have weighed five hundred pounds when full  he also repaired farm equipment for his father and their neighbors�  mcauley is remembered locally as a �country carpenter�  in  the history of hopewell presbyterian church reminisced that he �had no speculative ability nor any thirst for gain his labor was solely for the art of his trade� mcauley is listed in the census records of   and  as a farmer   ironically he never considered himself to be a builder by trade and never built a house for himself  he did however alter the house he inherited from his father to such an extent that it bore his trademark woodwork�               mcauley was still in his twenties when albert mccoy asked him to build this house though he had built an addition to another home this was his first commission for an entire building his unusual splayed front door surrounds and unique handcarved mantels are considered his signature the door surround angles outward at both the top and the bottom on fireplace mantels he created architraves adorned by distinctive curves with deep bevels whose pitch changes throughout the curve� no two of the seven mantels in the albert mccoy house are alike and all of the woodwork is finely executed his skills as a carpenter are evident throughout the house                 the history of hopewell presbyterian church documented at least ten houses in the immediate area built by mcauley though there were probably many more�   in addition to the albert mccoy house four others that are still standing include the kerns house s on kems road the w b parks house c  on beatties ford road the parksjetton house recently demolished on neck road and the rectory at st mark�s episcopal church c  on mt hollyhuntersville road  mcauley also erected houses outside of the immediate hopewell community  two such examples are the william and cora osborne house c  at  ramah church road and the greyknox house c  at  gilead road in huntersville                  mcauley�s work emphasizes finelycrafted detail over the latest fashion all of the houses he built are either traditional ihouse kerns house greyknox house osborne house and parksjetton  house or sidegableandwing forms wb parks house albert mccoy house and st mark�s rectory all are of frame construction and all feature handcarved interior woodwork every example except the parksjetton house has his signature splayed front door surround the albert mccoy house is especially significant since it is known to have been mcauley�s first housebuilding project  although it is a common form the albert mccoy house is extraordinarily uncommon in its wellexecuted craftsmanship and attention to detail                    the albert mccoy farm with its seventysix acres of pasture and woods and c  twostory sidegableandwing house surrounded by a complete collection of outbuildings retains the integrity of a working farm from the latenineteenth through the first half of the twentieth century the mccoy farm eligible for listing in the national register under criterion a for its significance in the area of agriculture retains a landscape of fields pastures and tree stands that is evocative of historic rural mecklenburg county which is a landscape increasingly threatened with development the mccoy farm is also eligible under criterion c for architecture for the wellpreserved sidegableandwing farmhouse built by skilled local craftsman john ellis mcauley the significance of the mccoy farm is discussed in �historic and architectural resources of rural mecklenburg county north carolina� national register multiple property documentation form in the context entitled �postbellum and latenineteenth to early twentieth century agriculture � the property meets the registration requirements for property type ic postbellum farmhouses and property type  outbuildings the significance statement that follows provides additional context in order to extend the period of significance to                 albert mccoy  a civil war veteran and a founder of st mark�s church the first episcopal church in northern mecklenburg county established the farm on the land he inherited from his father the property is a rare surviving example of a piedmont north carolina farm that has remained in the ownership of the same family and has been farmed continually for nearly one hundred and fifteen years the period of significance is c  to  a period during which the mccoy farm held a significant role in the process and technology of farming in mecklenburg county      historical background  agricultural context   mccoy family             mecklenburg county was populated in the mid eighteenth century primarily by scotchirish settlers who supported themselves by farming one such settler was ezekial beaty mccoy who had come to north carolina from pennsylvania in  beaty purchased farmland on gar creek in the long creek section of the county which ultimately was passed to his son john mccoy john�s son marshall rudolphus mccoy  obtained several hundred acres and built and resided in a log house nearby on kerns road still standing in  marshall rudoiphus mccoy�s son albert mccoy  acquired  acres of his late father�s estate and was farming on the land by              albert mccoy was educated at statesville military institute at age eighteen he enlisted in company c th regiment nicknamed �mecklenburg�s wide awakes� of the confederate states army he served as a private during the civil war until he was discharged in june  he returned to his native mecklenburg county and married catherine j n potts in  within five years catherine bad borne a child catherine lura mccoy and then died after catherine�s death albert married a neighbor mary catherine gluyas   mary was the daughter of captain thomas gluyas  who was a founding member of st mark�s episcopal church and was described at the time of his death as �one of the most successful planters in the county�                 albert and mary mccoy had twelve children between  and  in  albert�s mother rebecca deeded to albert  acres of mccoy land that had been owned by her husband marshall rudolphus mccoy  by  albert and mary had set up farming and housekeeping on the land it is thought that they initially lived in a house somewhere near the present dwelling which has long since perished in or around  albert commissioned local builder john ellis meauley to construct a new house for his growing family thomas and latitia gluyas house ca                 family history states that the eighth child joseph bennet mccoy who was born in november of  was the first child born in the new house the  census finds albert mary and all twelve of their children living together at this location in addition a ninetyyearold former slave lizzie also lived with the family later albert�s children would erect a stone marker in honor of lizzie and her husband jim at the slave cemetery nearby where they were interred a fund was set up in  for the perpetual care of the slave cemetery which is well maintained to this day             st mark�s episcopal church the first episcopal church in north mecklenburg county was formed in  by albert mccoy his brother columbus w mccoy fatherinlaw captain thomas gluyas and others the first meetings were held on albert�s land the first rector joseph blount cheshire said of albert mccoy �from the first to the last he was attached to the church with an earnest devotion and enthusiasm which i have seldom seen equaled�            at the time of his death in  albert was �credited with being the oldest member of the masonic order in charlotte or vicinity and is believed by some to be the oldest mason in the state� he had joined the organization in  his obituary further stated that �he was a man of commanding personality irreproachable character and uprightness in his private life and a citizen of the highest type� albert was known to his relatives as a local historian and was proud to claim kinship with john mcknitt alexander and major john davidson both local heroes of the revolutionary war era               albert mccoy supported his large family off the land where he lived his entire life agricultural census records available only for  provide insight into the farm activities in the period just before the albert mccoy house was built they reveal that seventyfive acres were tilled seventy acres were in meadow pasture and orchard or otherwise improved and  acres were in woodland twentyfive acres were planted in indian corn which yielded  bushels and was the largest crop oats thirty bushels wheat fortyfive bushels and cotton ten bales were all produced in smaller amounts one acre was devoted to each an apple orchard  trees and a peach orchard  trees there were eighty poultry animals which laid seventyfive dozen eggs in  bees provided  pounds of honey in that year other animals around the farm included nine horses three mules four cows three sheep and seven swine  pounds of butter were processed on the farm four surviving outbuildingsa smokehouse a wellhouse a privy and a log cribare thought to have been built at the same time as the house and are directly related to the activities on the mccoy farm during the period of significance c  to                 at  acres albert mccoy�s tract was considerably larger than the typical farm in mecklenburg county which averaged  acres in  spratt�s map of  illustrates that there were no other farms on mccoy road or even in the immediate vicinity at that time statistics show that in  only  of mecklenburg county farms were between  and  acres in size and only  were larger than  acres evaluated against the analysis done by dr william huffman for the  �historic and architectural resources of rural mecklenburg county� national register multiple property documentation form the range of production on albert mccoy�s farm proves to have been typical for mecklenburg county during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries huffman says �production was mainly grain and cotton with livestock being an important but secondary activity� he mentions cattle sheep swine poultry and eggs and states that �corn clearly dominated the cereal crops with wheat and oats next compared to three other national register farms in the community the ephraim alexander mcauley farm nr  the samuel j mcelroy house nr  and the dr walter pharr craven house nr  the albert mccoy farm was very similar in output to its neighboring farms though smaller these three nearby farms grew primarily corn followed by wheat andor oats and cotton they all had a few livestock and two also had some egglaying poultry two farms mcauley and mcelroy had apple and peach orchards evidently this mix of grains fruit cattle and dairy products was a successful combination in north mecklenburg county                when albert died in  his holdings were divided among several of his children in accordance with the terms of his will his property was divided into thirteen lots ten of which were between forty and fortyseven acres in size lots four and five were combined into one sixtyfive acre tract which included the house and outbuildings this homeplace tract ultimately went to the eldest daughter ella letitia mccoy nisbet ��               ella married william alexander nisbet in  and they had five children together� they lived in the house and actively farmed the land though no one cash crop dominated the youngest son dr thomas gluyas nisbet  recalled living in the house from the mids through  ella died in  and william died in  the property passed to the three surviving children thomas and his two sisters thomas g nisbet leased the property from  through the mid s during which time cattle were maintained on the land� farming was thus continued on the land throughout the period of significance c  to               in accordance with thomas g nisbet�s wishes the albert mccoy farm was sold to dr thomas h mccoy after nisbet�s death thomas h mccoy is the son of joseph bennet mccoy jr who is in turn the son of joseph bennet mccoy sr who was born in the house in  and was the son of albert and mary mccoy thomas h mccoy is thus a direct descendant of albert mccoy     interview with dr thomas h mccoy  aug  mecklenburg county deed book  p  deed book  p  u s department of commerce bureau of the census
