user a jetpack company is coming out with flying cars advanced transport a jetpack company is coming out with flying cars google play in brief as battery technology increases with the evergrowing use of electric cars a flying vehicle will become more and more possible while jetpack aviation is making huge leaps forward in flying car design and technology they are not the only ones there is actually competition in the flying car market flying cars on the horizon the guys who brought the world its first working jetpack are now looking to get into the flying car business david mayman of jetpack aviation jpa took some time to discuss his new concept designs with new atlas the concept vehicle would be a manned multirotor vehicle with a dozen propellers arrayed coaxially the vehicle would be capable of speeds up to  kmh  mph and vertical takeoff and landing vtol one of the drawbacks of this technology at this point in development is how limited fly times are given the current state of battery capacity however as more traditional car companies go electric the technology will catch up rapidly according to mayman “…the beauty of distributed electric propulsion is that it’s very very scalable the way that electric motors work it’s hey you wanna make something for two people ok you just add power to the electric motors”   image credit jpa                                                                 closer than you think the rapid pace of current technological innovation is actually making the first flying cars relatively easy to develop drone technology can be thanked for much of the advancement “drone technology has advanced all of that stuff – the autopilot the stabilization – to the point where we nearly don’t have to do any rd for that we can just about start from offtheshelf products and customize it for our use” says mayman there is actually plenty of competition in this burgeoning field some of the biggest names in both tech and aviation are throwing their concepts into the race a skype cofounder is investing millions in a superfast flying car concept that reaches speeds up to  kmh  mph a google cofounder was even spotted coming out of a flying car in october of last year and perhaps the most exciting prospect comes from airbus’s plans to develop an autonomous flying car sometime this year references new atlas kabc written by patrick

the future here’s your real jetpackdavid z morrisnov  even if all the hoverboards selfdriving cars and handheld communication gizmos havent convinced you there’s no more denying that we live in a mindbending science fiction dreamlandthe jetpack is herethe jb which van nuysbased maker jetpack aviation calls the “world’s only true jetpack” had its comingout party last week during a flight around the statue of libertythere have of course been many other claimants to the jetpack name but the jb is “different to anything else being flown or that has been flown historically” says david mayman jetpack aviation’s ceo and test pilotthe jb is the product of ten years of collaboration between mayman and nelson tyler a process chronicled in a forthcoming documentary to be titled own the sky tyler is best known appropriately enough as an inventor for hollywood where his advanced camera tools have earned him three oscars for technical achievementtyler was also the brains behind a socalled “rocket belt” developed in the s inspired by the bell rocket belt that appeared in the  james bond movie thunderball tyler’s version had a long career in the movies and tvrelatedbrainstorm techhow technology is creating major upheaval in the workplacebrainstorm techhow technology is creating major upheaval in the workplacebut just like most other almostjetpacks the rocket belt had serious limitations flight times were under  seconds which is why their main application has been in hollywood the jb has flight times of ten minutes or morethen there’s yves rossy and his jetman dubai team who fly jetpowered wingsuits but those deploy from a helicopter while the jb offers true vertical takeoff and landing according to mayman he can almost land on a dimefinally the martin jetpack is perhaps the least convincing contender for the title—it’s neither a jet nor a pack “they called it a jetpack because it’s a sexy marketing term” says mayman in his genial aussie burr “but it’s actually a gasoline powered piston engine that drives ducted fans”it’s also the size of a large motorcycle and impossible for a wearer to carry “effectively it’s a drone” says mayman “and then they put a man inside it”the only proper jetpack previously produced at least by maymans standards was the bell aerosystems and williams international “jet belt” of the late s but it was extremely heavy and barely got past the rd phasethe jb in contrast to the martin runs scaleddown versions of the same kind of jet engines that drive a  or f unlike the old bellwilliams device it’s light enough to be carried by a wearer on foot and small enough to fit into the back seat of a car the jb also runs on a range of fuels including diesel and kerosene mayman says most of the jb’s performance advantages are thanks to recent advances in jet engine technologythere is still that eternal question of the jetpack—how do you not burn your legs “it’s really not hot” insists mayman “i could fly in shorts” that’s because the exhaust mixes with ambient air almost immediatelyanother advantage of the pure jetpack is its performance in high winds and turbulence “we have no wings so when we fly into  or  mile per hour winds we hardly feel it”all of that makes the jb at the very least the first jetpack with potential practical applications mayman is particularly keen to see it in the hands of emergency responders who could travel several miles over rough terrain much more easily than in a helicopter mayman says hes fielded inquiries from hollywood no surprise individual collectors and marketers who are curious about setting up a jetpack race series cross your fingersthere are caveats even if the design is ready for prime time the jb is a prototype and production at any scale is still in the future mayman wouldn’t speculate on the units eventual pricemayman is also the only person who has ever flown the jb his swing around the statue of liberty came after what he admits was a sometimesrocky learning curve including dozens of practice flights on a safety tether over two years quicker training would be essential to realworld adoptionlegally mayman says jbs could be sold tomorrow under the federal aviation administration’s ultralight aircraft classification but acknowledging that this is a particularly risky form of flight jetpack aviation wants to carefully select and train prospective pilots even mayman hasnt taken the machine to its altitude limits since the planned parachute assembly isnt completefor all the market demand for a true jet pack mayman says the jb has always been mainly a passion project he’s a dedicated pilot of planes and helicopters but he says nothing compares with the jetpack experience“ah it’s extraordinary mayman gushes it’s like riding a motorcycle in the sky it’s so maneuverable all you have to do is think—i want to go left and really you don’t do anything it just goes left“it becomes part of your body”for more about the

around by the pilot it should be powerful enough to lift the pilot quickly to thousands of feet above the ground but small enough to fit into the trunk of a car in contrast most jetpacks are actually
