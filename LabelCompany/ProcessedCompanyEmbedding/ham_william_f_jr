believing jews had special access to political power and influence and that they represent a subversive social force the targets for his preaching were often nebulous rings of jewish catholic or black conspirators plotting to destroy white protestant america  in  wo saunders a newspaper editor in elizabeth city north carolina confronted ham for defaming a prominent jew during an evangelistic campaign ham had accused the president of sears roebuck  company in chicago julius rosenwald of operating interracial prostitution rings in chicago that exploited white women saunders wrote an account of the accusations ham had made and how saunders had proved them false called the book of ham  the book was widely distributed describing instances of hams negative views towards jews ham believed in

great aggressiveness evangelizing along the gulf of mexico ham held meetings at the first baptist church of new orleans which brought thirty converts in  he returned to new orleans in  for a meeting jointly sponsored by baptists presbyterians and methodists and three thousand responded in fort worth ham held a meeting with j frank norris another conservative evangelist known for his strict biblical interpretation the two developed a personal and professional relationship which was sometimes strained norris in most instances tried to dominate his friends and associates to his advantage and benefit ham used several unique strategies for reaching people often confronting individuals facetoface he employed gospel cars in several cities to draw attention to his revivals while in houston the gospel car approached an individual on the edge of a bayou who was contemplating suicide the man was converted to christianity as a result if street cars were unavailable ham used horses and

racism and antisemitism he believed and preached on various topics based on classical antisemitic canards such as believing jews had special access to political power and influence and that they represent a subversive social force the targets for his preaching were often nebulous rings of jewish catholic or black conspirators plotting to destroy white protestant america  in  wo saunders a newspaper editor in elizabeth city north carolina confronted ham for defaming a prominent jew during an evangelistic campaign ham had accused the president of sears roebuck  company in chicago julius rosenwald of operating interracial prostitution rings in chicago that exploited white women saunders wrote an account of the accusations ham had made and how saunders had proved them false called the book of ham  the book was widely distributed describing instances of hams negative views towards jews ham believed in the ideas of british israelism that the white anglosaxon races had been chosen by god ham outlined this in a piece of writing called the need of the angloisrael truth that is featured on some websites of the identity movement targeting texasedit ham held more than seventyfive meetings in texas including beaumont houston austin galveston bay city port arthur corpus christi fort worth and longview at the close of each meeting ham would extend a lengthy invitation during which time he would by mass persuasion draw attendees to make decisions for christ ie to step forward and by an act of prayer profess their newfound faith in christ ham held his first texas meeting in  in the community of hico with  decisions for christ similarly there were  decisions thereafter in garland east of dallas jb gambrell editor of the baptist standard newspaper described hams garland meeting brother ham is a young man and has been preaching but a short time he has distinct elements of power in the first place he preaches certainties and not doubts an evangelist of doubt is a sorry traveler in these low grounds he believes the great truths of the bible up to the hilt and he preaches with directness and great aggressiveness evangelizing along the gulf of mexico ham held meetings at the first baptist church of new orleans which brought thirty converts in  he returned to new orleans in  for a meeting jointly sponsored by baptists presbyterians and methodists and three thousand responded in fort worth ham held a meeting with j frank norris another conservative evangelist known for his strict biblical interpretation the two developed a personal and professional relationship which was sometimes strained norris in most instances tried to dominate his friends and associates to his advantage and benefit ham used several unique strategies for reaching people often confronting individuals facetoface he employed gospel cars in several cities to draw attention to his revivals while in houston the gospel car approached an individual on the edge of a bayou who was contemplating suicide the man was converted to christianity as a result if street cars were unavailable ham used horses and wagons in one of the meetings in houston the parade assembled included more than two thousand vehicles including a hearse in  the meetings in the border city of laredo a traditionally roman catholic area and in tyler the largest city of east texas netted three hundred decisions each in  there were  decisions in san angelo in tom green county in west texas ej lyon pastor of the first baptist church of san angelo encouraged other baptist pastors to assist ham in his crusades    baptists in the states will make no mistake in working with ham as they usually get more members than any other churches in the meetings then they get more than they could get in a church meeting of their own yet again the general tone of christian living is lifed in the whole religious life of the city which makes it easier for the new members to be strengthened in christian service in  there
