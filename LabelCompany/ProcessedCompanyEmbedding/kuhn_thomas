share on messenger close john naughton saturday  august   edt first published on saturday  august   edt fifty years ago this month one of the most influential books of the th century was published by the university of chicago press many if not most lay people have probably never heard of its author thomas kuhn or of his book the structure of scientific revolutions but their thinking has almost certainly been influenced by his ideas the litmus test is whether youve ever heard or used the term paradigm shift which is probably the most used – and abused – term in contemporary discussions of organisational change and intellectual progress a google search for it returns more than  million hits for example and it currently turns up inside no fewer than  of the books marketed by amazon it is also one of the most cited academic books of all time so if ever a big idea went viral this is it the real measure of kuhns importance however lies not in the infectiousness of one of his concepts but in the fact that he singlehandedly changed the way we think about mankinds most organised attempt to understand the world before kuhn our view of science was dominated by philosophical ideas about how it ought to develop the scientific method together with a heroic narrative of scientific progress as the addition of new truths to the stock of old truths or the increasing approximation of theories to the truth and in the odd case the correction of past errors as the stanford encyclopaedia of philosophy puts it before kuhn in other words we had what amounted to the whig interpretation of scientific history in which past researchers theorists and experimenters had engaged in a long march if not towards truth then at least towards greater and greater understanding of the natural world kuhns version of how science develops differed dramatically from the whig version where the standard account saw steady cumulative progress he saw discontinuities – a set of alternating normal and revolutionary phases in which communities of specialists in particular fields are plunged into periods of turmoil uncertainty and angst these revolutionary phases – for example the transition from newtonian mechanics to quantum physics – correspond to great conceptual breakthroughs and lay the basis for a succeeding phase of business as usual the fact that his version seems unremarkable now is in a way the greatest measure of his success but in  almost everything about it was controversial because of the challenge it posed to powerful entrenched philosophical assumptions about how science did – and should – work what made it worse for philosophers of science was that kuhn wasnt even a philosopher he was a physicist dammit born in  in cincinnati he studied physics at harvard graduating summa cum laude in  after which he was swept up by the war effort to work on radar he returned to harvard after the war to do a phd – again in physics – which he obtained in  he was then elected into the universitys elite society of fellows and might have continued to work on quantum physics until the end of his days had he not been commissioned to teach a course on science for humanities students as part of the general education in science curriculum this was the brainchild of harvards reforming president james conant who believed that every educated person should know something about science the course was centred around historical case studies and teaching it forced kuhn to study old scientific texts in detail for the first time physicists then as now dont go in much for history kuhns encounter with the scientific work of aristotle turned out to be a life and careerchanging epiphany the question i hoped to answer he recalled later was how much mechanics aristotle had known how much he had left for people such as galileo and newton to discover given that formulation i rapidly discovered that aristotle had known almost no mechanics at all… that conclusion was standard and it might in principle have been right but i found it bothersome because as i was reading him aristotle appeared not only ignorant of mechanics but a dreadfully bad physical scientist as well about motion in particular his writings seemed to me full of egregious errors both of logic and of observation what kuhn had run up against was the central weakness of the whig interpretation of history by the standards of presentday physics aristotle looks like an idiot and yet we know he wasnt kuhns blinding insight came from the sudden realisation that if one is to understand aristotelian science one must know about the intellectual tradition within which aristotle worked one must understand for example that for him the term motion meant change in general – not just the change in position of a physical body which is how we think of it or to put it in more general terms to understand scientific development one must understand the intellectual frameworks within which scientists work that insight is the engine that drives kuhns great book kuhn remained at harvard until  and having failed to get tenure moved to the university of california at berkeley where he wrote structure… and was promoted to a professorship in  the following year the book was published by the university of chicago press despite the  pages of the first edition kuhn – in his characteristic oldworld scholarly style – always referred to it as a mere sketch he would doubtless have preferred to have written an page doorstop but in the event the readability and relative brevity of the sketch was a key factor in its eventual success although the book was a slow starter selling only  copies in  by mid it had sold  copies and sales to date now stand at  million copies for a cerebral work of this calibre these are harry potterscale numbers kuhns central claim is that a careful study of the history of science reveals that development in any scientific field happens via a series of phases the first he christened normal science – business as usual if you like in this phase a community of researchers who share a common intellectual framework – called a paradigm or a disciplinary matrix – engage in solving puzzles thrown up by discrepancies anomalies between what the paradigm predicts and what is revealed by observation or experiment most of the time the anomalies are resolved either by incremental changes to the paradigm or by uncovering observational or experimental error as philosopher ian hacking puts it in his terrific preface to the new edition of structure normal science does not aim at novelty but at clearing up the status quo it tends to discover what it expects to discover the trouble is that over longer periods unresolved anomalies accumulate and eventually get to the point where some scientists begin to question the paradigm itself at this point the discipline enters a period of crisis characterised by in kuhns words a proliferation of compelling articulations the willingness to try anything the expression of explicit discontent the recourse to philosophy and to debate over fundamentals in the end the crisis is resolved by a revolutionary change in worldview in which the nowdeficient paradigm is replaced by a newer one this is the paradigm shift of modern parlance and after it has happened the scientific field returns to normal science based on the new framework and so it goes on this brutal summary of the revolutionary process does not do justice to the complexity and subtlety of kuhns thinking to appreciate these you have to read his book but it does perhaps indicate why structure… came as such a bombshell to the philosophers and historians who had pieced together the whig interpretation of scientific progress as an illustration take kuhns portrayal of normal science the most influential philosopher of science in  was karl popper described by hacking as the most widely read and to some extent believed by practising scientists popper summed up the essence of the scientific method in the title of one of his books conjectures and refutations according to popper real scientists as opposed to say psychoanalysts were distinguished by the fact that they tried to refute rather than confirm their theories and yet kuhns version suggested that the last thing normal scientists seek to do is to refute the theories embedded in their paradigm many people were also enraged by kuhns description of most scientific activity as mere puzzlesolving – as if mankinds most earnest quest for knowledge was akin to doing the times crossword but in fact these critics were oversensitive a puzzle is something to which there is a solution that doesnt mean that finding it is easy or that it will not require great ingenuity and sustained effort the unconscionably expensive quest for the higgs boson that has recently come to fruition at cern for example is a prime example of puzzlesolving because the existence of the particle was predicted by the prevailing paradigm the socalled standard model of particle physics but what really set the cat among the philosophical pigeons was one implication of kuhns account of the process of paradigm change he argued that competing paradigms are incommensurable that is to say there exists no objective way of assessing their relative merits theres no way for example that one could make a checklist comparing the merits of newtonian mechanics which applies to snooker balls and planets but not to anything that goes on inside the atom and quantum mechanics which deals with what happens at the subatomic level but if rival paradigms are really incommensurable then doesnt that imply that scientific revolutions must be based – at least in part – on irrational grounds in which case are not the paradigm shifts that we celebrate as great intellectual breakthroughs merely the result of outbreaks of mob psychology kuhns book spawned a whole industry of commentary interpretation and exegesis his emphasis on the importance of communities of scientists clustered round a shared paradigm essentially triggered the growth of a new academic discipline – the sociology of science – in which researchers began to examine scientific disciplines much as anthropologists studied exotic tribes and in which science was regarded not as a sacred untouchable product of the enlightenment but as just another subculture as for his big idea – that of a paradigm as an intellectual framework that makes research possible –well it quickly escaped into the wild and took on a life of its own hucksters marketers and business school professors adopted it as a way of explaining the need for radical changes of worldview in their clients and social scientists saw the adoption of a paradigm as a route to respectability and research funding which in due course led to the emergence of pathological paradigms in fields such as economics which came to esteem mastery of mathematics over an understanding of how banking actually works with the consequences that we now have to endure the most intriguing idea however is to use kuhns thinking to interpret his own achievement in his quiet way he brought about a conceptual revolution by triggering a shift in our understanding of science from a whiggish paradigm to a kuhnian one and much of what is now done in the history and philosophy of science might be regarded as normal science within the new paradigm but already the anomalies are beginning to accumulate kuhn like popper thought that science was mainly about theory but an increasing amount of cuttingedge scientific research is data rather than theorydriven and while physics was undoubtedly the queen of the sciences when structure… was being written that role has now passed to molecular genetics and biotechnology does kuhns analysis hold good for these new areas of science and if not isnt it time for a paradigm shift in the meantime if youre making a list of books to read before you

external links quotesedit only when they must choose between competing theories do scientists behave like philosophers thomas kuhn  in logic of discovery or psychology of research edited by imre lakatos alan musgrave  criticism and the growth of knowledge cambridge university press p  isbn   the structure of scientific revolutions edit thomas kuhn the structure of scientific revolutions university of chicago press  second edition enlarged  third edition  fourth edition  to my complete surprise that exposure to outofdate scientific theory and practice radically undermined some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and the reasons for its special success those conceptions were ones i had previously drawn partly from scientific training itself and partly from a longstanding avocational interest in the philosophy of science somehow whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study displayed yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions of science and their failures of verisimilitude therefore seemed thoroughly worth pursuing the result was a drastic shift in my career plans a shift from physics to history of science and then gradually from relatively straightforward historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that had initially led me to history preface somehow the practice of astronomy physics chemistry or biology normally fails to evoke the controversies over fundamentals that today seem endemic among say psychologists or sociologists attempting to discover the source of that difference led me to recognize the role in scientific research of what i have since called “paradigms” these i take to be universally recognized scientific achievements that for a time provide model problems and solutions for a community of practitioners p xiii  ed preface history if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or chronology could produce a decisive transformation in the image of science by which we are now possessed i introduction a role of history outofdate theories are not in principle unscientific because they have been discarded that choice however makes it difficult to see scientific development as a process of accretion i introduction a role of history normal science the activity in which most scientists inevitably spend almost all their time is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like normal science often suppresses fundamental novelties because they are necessarily subversive of its basic commitments p  i introduction a role of history normal science means research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice p  ii the route to normal science men whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice that commitment and the apparent consensus it produces are prerequisites for normal science ie for the genesis and continuation of a particular research tradition p   ed ever since prehistoric antiquity one field of study after another has crossed the divide between what the historian might call its prehistory as a science and its history proper these transitions to maturity have seldom been so sudden or so unequivocal as my necessarily schematic discussion may have implied but neither have they been historically gradual coextensive that is to say with the entire development of the fields within which they occurred p   ed ii the route to normal science few people who are not actually practitioners of a mature science realize how much mopup work of this sort a paradigm leaves to be done or quite how fascinating such work can prove in the execution p   ed iii the nature of normal science these three classes of problems—determination of significant fact matching of facts with theory and articulation of theory—exhaust i think the literature of normal science both empirical and theoretical they do not of course quite exhaust the entire literature of science there are also extraordinary problems and it may well be their resolution that makes the scientific enterprise as a whole so particularly worthwhile but extraordinary problems are not to be had for the asking they emerge only on special occasions prepared by the advance of normal research p   ed iii the nature of normal science the scientific enterprise as a whole does from time to time prove useful open up new territory display order and test longaccepted belief nevertheless the individual engaged on a normal research problem is almost never doing any one of these things once engaged his motivation is of a rather different sort what then challenges him is the conviction that if only he is skillful enough he will succeed in solving a puzzle that no one before has solved or solved so well p  scientists work from models acquired through education and through subsequent exposure to the literature often without quite knowing or needing to know what characteristics have given these models the status of community paradigms p  v the priority of paradigms normal science the puzzlesolving activity we have just examined is a highly cumulative enterprise eminently successful in its aim the steady extension of the scope and precision of scientific knowledge in all these respects it fits with great precision the most usual image of scientific work yet one standard product of the scientific enterprise is missing normal science does not aim at novelties of fact or theory and when successful finds none p  vi anomaly and the emergence of scientific discoveries we must now ask how changes of this sort can come about considering first discoveries or novelties of fact and then inventions or novelties of theory that distinction between discovery and invention or between fact and theory will however immediately prove to be exceedingly artificial p   ed vi anomaly and the emergence of scientific discoveries in science as in the playing card experiment novelty emerges only with difficulty manifested by resistance against a background provided by expectation p   ed vi anomaly and the emergence of scientific discoveries in the development of any science the first received paradigm is usually felt to account quite successfully for most of the observations and experiments easily accessible to that science’s practitioners further development therefore ordinarily calls for the construction of elaborate equipment the development of an esoteric vocabulary and skills and a refinement of concepts that increasingly lessens their resemblance to their usual commonsense prototypes that professionalization leads on the one hand to an immense restriction of the scientist’s vision and to a considerable resistance to paradigm change the science has become increasingly rigid on the other hand within those areas to which the paradigm directs the attention of the group normal science leads to a detail of information and to a precision of the observationtheory match that could be achieved in no other way p   ed vi anomaly and the emergence of scientific discoveries philosophers of science have repeatedly demonstrated that more than one theoretical construction can always be placed upon a given collection of data history of science indicates that particularly in the early developmental stages of a new paradigm it is not even very difficult to invent such alternates but that invention of alternates is just what scientists seldom undertake except during the preparadigm stage of their science’s development and at very special occasions during its subsequent evolution so long as the tools a paradigm supplies continue to prove capable of solving the problems it defines science moves fastest and penetrates most deeply through confident employment of those tools the reason is clear as in manufacture so in science—retooling is an extravagance to be reserved for the occasion that demands it the significance of crises is the indication they provide that an occasion for retooling has arrived p   ed  vii crisis and the emergence of scientific theories scientific revolutions are inaugurated by a growing sense that an existing paradigm has ceased to function adequately in the exploration of an aspect of nature to which that paradigm itself had previously led the way p   ed the subject of a gestalt demonstration knows that his perception has shifted because he can make it shift back and forth repeatedly while he holds the same book or piece of paper in his hands the subject of a gestalt demonstration knows that his perception has shifted because he can make it shift back and forth repeatedly while he holds the same book or piece of paper in his hands aware that nothing in his environment has changed he directs his attention increasingly not to the figure duck or rabbit but to the lines of the paper he is looking at ultimately he may even learn to see those lines without seeing either of the figures and he may then say what he could not legitimately have said earlier that it is these lines that he really sees but that he sees them alternately as a duck and as a rabbit as in all similar psychological experiments the effectiveness of the demonstration depends upon its being analyzable in this way unless there were an external standard with respect to which a switch of vision could be demonstrated no conclusion about alternate perceptual possibilities could be drawn p  rd edn x revolutions as changes of world view these examples point to the third and most fundamental aspect of the incommensurability of competing paradigms in a sense that i am unable to explicate further the proponents of competing paradigms practice their trades in different worlds one contains constrained bodies that fall slowly the other pendulums that repeat their motions again and again in one solutions are compounds in the other mixtures one is embedded in a flat the other in a curved matrix of space practicing in different worlds the two groups of scientists see different things when they look from the same point in the same direction again that is not to say that they can see anything they please both are looking at the world and what they look at has not changed but in some areas they see different things and they see them in different relations one to the other that is why a law that cannot even be demonstrated to one group of scientists may occasionally seem intuitively obvious to another p  xii the resolution of revolutions we may to be more precise have to relinquish the notion explicit or implicit that changes of paradigm carry scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to the truth p  xiii progress through revolutions the road since structure edit thomas kuhn the road since structure philosophical essays  with an autobiographical interview edited by james f conant and john haugeland university of chicago press  i rapidly discovered that aristotle had known almost no mechanics at all  how could his characteristic talents have deserted him so systematically when he turned to the study of motion and mechanics equally if his talents had so deserted him why had his writings in physics been taken so seriously for so many centuries after his death  i was sitting at my desk with the text of aristotles physics open in front of me suddenly the fragments in my head sorted themselves out in a new way and fell into place together my jaw dropped for all at once aristotle seemed a very good physicist indeed but of a sort id never dreamed possible now i could understand why he had said what hed said and what his authority had been statements that had previously seemed egregious mistakes now seemed at worst near misses within a powerful and generally successful tradition that sort of experience  the pieces suddenly sorting themselves out and coming together in a new way  is the first general characteristic of revolutionary change that i shall be singling out after further consideration of examples though scientific revolutions leave much piecemeal mopping up to do the central change cannot be experienced piecemenal one step at a time instead it involves some relatively sudden and unstructured transformation in which some part of the flux of experience sorts itself out differently and displays patterns that were not visible before p  from what are scientific revolutions  by now it may be clear that the position im developing is a sort of postdarwinian kantianism p  from the road since structure  quotes about thomas kuhnedit a few years ago i happened to meet kuhn at a scientific meeting and complained to him about the nonsense that had been attached to his name he reacted angrily in a voice loud enough to be heard by everyone in the hall he shouted one thing you have to understand i am not a kuhnian freeman dyson the sun the genome and the internet tools of scientific revolutions  kuhn cannot take seriously that “there is some one full objective true account of nature” does this mean that he does not take truth seriously not at all  kuhn did reject a simple “correspondence theory” which says true statements correspond to facts about the world in the wave of skepticism that swept american scholarship at the end of the twentieth century many influential intellectuals took kuhn as an ally in their denials of truth as a virtue i mean the thinkers of the sort that cannot write down or utter the word true except by literally or figuratively putting quotation marks around it—to indicate how they shudder at the very thought of so harmful a notion many reflective scientists who admire much of what kuhn says about the sciences believe he encouraged deniers it is true that structure gave enormous impetus to sociological studies of science some of that work with its emphasis on the idea that facts are “socially constructed” and apparent participation in the denial of “truth” is exactly what conservative scientists protest against kuhn made plain that he himself detested that development of his work ian hacking  introductory essay in th anniversary edition of thomas kuhns the structure of scientific revolution notice that there is no sociology in the book scientific communities and their practices are however at its core entering with paradigms as we saw at page  and continuing to the final page of the book there had been sociology of scientific knowledge before kuhn but after structure it burgeoned leading to what is now called science studies this is a selfgenerating field with of course its own journals and societies that includes some work in the history and the philosophy of sciences and technology but whose emphasis is on sociological approaches of various kinds some observational some theoretical much and perhaps most of the really original thinking about the sciences after kuhn has had a sociological bent kuhn was hostile to these developments in the opinion of many younger workers that is regrettable let us put it down to dissatisfaction with growing pains of the field rather than venturing into tedious metaphors about fathers and sons one of kuhn’s marvelous legacies is science studies as we know it today ian hacking  introductory essay in th anniversary edition of thomas kuhns the structure of scientific revolution well he wasnt a relativist theres a long and complicated story of the rise of a desire for scientific relativism part of it may well be simply sort of rage against reason the fear of the sciences and a kind of total dislike of the arrogance of a great many scientists who say were finding out the truth about everything—and here with kuhn there was a way to undermine that arrogance ian hacking in gary stix a qa with ian hacking on thomas kuhns legacy as the paradigm shift turns  april   kuhn had the genius to find the words and sketch the concepts that made important old philosophical problems relevant to the public and newly discussable by philosophers he had the strength of mind and commitment to lead the discussion he could speak the truly incommensurable languages of physics philosophy and history all necessary to frame and advance his epistemological quest he wrote as one of his admirers margaret masterman put it in a quasipoetic style sometimes veiled sometimes with rhetorical exaggeration but always after careful and even painful thought or to switch metaphors he drew the portrait of science in the manner of the impressionists at a distance where most viewers stand the portrait appears illuminating persuasive and inspiring close in where historians and philosophers stare it looks sketchy puzzling and richly challenging john l heilbron thomas samuel kuhn  july  june  isis vol  no  sep  see also john l heilbronthomas samuel kuhn  july  june   kuhns recognition that science might cease—leaving us with what charles sanders peirce had defined as the truth about nature—made it even more imperative for kuhn than for popper to challenge sciences authority to deny that science can ever arrive at absolute truth the one thing i think you shouldnt say is that now weve found out what the world is really like kuhn said because thats not what i think the game is about john horgan the end of science  ch   the end of philosophy what truth is not according to kuhn is an accurate representation of the world as it is in itself scientific theories represent a world but one partially constituted by the cognitive activities of the scientists themselves this is not a commonsensical view but it has a distinguished philosophical pedigree associated most strongly with kant the kantian view is that the truths we can know are truths about a ‘phenomenal’ world that is the joint product of the ‘things in themselves’ and the organising conceptual activity of the human mind kuhn however is kant on wheels where kant held that the human contribution to the phenomenal world is invariant kuhn’s view is that it changes fundamentally across a scientific revolution this is what he means by his notorious statement that after a scientific revolution ‘the world changes’ this is neither the trivial claim that scientists’ beliefs about the world change nor the crazy claim that scientists can change the things in themselves simply by changing their beliefs it is the claim that the phenomenal world changes because the human contribution to it changes peter lipton kant on wheels london review of books  july  kuhn as does popper rejects the idea that science grows by accumulation of eternal truths but while according to popper science is ‘revolution in permanence’ and criticism the heart of the scientiﬁc enterprise according to kuhn revolution is exceptional and indeed extrascientiﬁc and criticism is in ‘normal’ times anathema the clash between popper and kuhn is not about a mere technical point in epistemology it concerns our central intellectual values and has implications not only for theoretical physics but also for the underdeveloped social sciences and even for moral and political philosophy if even in science there is no other way of judging a theory but by assessing the number faith and vocal energy of its supporters then this must be even more so in the social sciences truth lies in power thus kuhn’s position would vindicate no doubt unintentionally the basic political credo of contemporary religious maniacs ‘student revolutionaries’ imre lakatos  from criticism and the growth of knowledge as cited in thora margareta bertilsson  peirces theory of inquiry and beyond p  kuhns description of how scientific revolutions happen does not apply to any biological revolution to be very frank i cannot understand how this book could have been such a success the general thesis was not new and when he did assert specific claims he was almost always wrong ernst mayr the grand old man of evolution an interview with evolutionary biologist ernst mayr interview by michael shermer and frank j sulloway skeptic  january  up until the publication of thomas kuhns the structure of scientific revolutions in  the history philosophy and sociology of science maintained an internalist approach to scientific knowledge claims science was seen as somehow above any social political or cultural influences and therefore the examinations of scientific knowledge focused on areas such as discoveries famous men and the scientific revolution in the west when kuhn opened the door to the possibility that external factors were involved in the development of scientific paradigms science studies assumed a more critical tone diane m rodgers  debugging the link between social theory and social insects i’m one of the few physicists i know who likes thomas kuhn he was partly a historian of science partly a sociologist he got the basic idea right of what happens when the scientific paradigm shifts a radical change of perspective suddenly occurs wholly new ideas concepts abstractions and pictures become relevant relativity was a big paradigm shift quantum mechanics was a big paradigm shift so we keep on inventing new realisms they never completely replace the old ideas but they do largely replace them with concepts that work better that describe nature better that are often very unfamiliar that make people question what is meant by “reality” then the next thing comes along and turns that on its head and we are always surprised that the old ways of thinking the wiring that we have or the mathematical wiring that we may have created simply fail us leonard susskind in bad boy of physics interview by peter byrne scientific american july  the structure of scientific revolutions was hugely influential especially on the liberal arts giving them ammunition to suggest that science was no better way of knowing the truth than any other way of investigating it made a huge case of scientists gathering around one truth and then there’s a tipping point and everyone moves away from that truth to gather around another truth hence the title of the book and this left people with the sense that science is just whatever is in fashion kuhn used as his best example of this copernicus that’s half his book  almost half of that book describes the copernican revolution as an example of the way science works but that’s not how science works it’s just not it’s how things happened until  neil degrasse tyson quoted in chuck klosterman but what if were wrong  in his celebrated book the structure of scientific revolutions thomas kuhn went a step further and argued that in scientific revolutions the standards or “paradigms” by which scientists judge theories change so that the new theories simply cannot be judged by the prerevolutionary standards there is much in kuhn’s book that fits my own experience in science but in the last chapter kuhn tentatively attacked the view that science makes progress toward objective truths “we may to be more precise have to relinquish the notion explicit or implicit that changes of paradigm carry scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to the truth” kuhn’s book lately seems to have become read or at least quoted as a manifesto for a general attack on the presumed objectivity of science steven weinberg dreams of a final theory  ch   against philosophy now that really was a paradigm shift for kuhn it seems to have been the paradigm of paradigm shifts which set a pattern into which he tried to shoehorn every other scientific revolution it really does fit kuhns description of paradigm shifts it is extraordinarily difficult for a modern scientist to get into the frame of mind of aristotelian physics and kuhns statement that all previous views of reality have proved false though not true of newtonian mechanics or maxwellian electrodynamics certainly does apply to aristotelian physics revolutions in science seem to fit kuhns description only to the extent that they mark a shift in understanding some aspect of nature from prescience to modern science the birth of newtonian physics was a megaparadigm shift but nothing that has happened in our understanding of motion since then—not the transition from newtonian to einsteinian mechanics or from classical to quantum physics—fits kuhns description of a paradigm shift

is one of the most influential philosophers of science of the twentieth century perhaps the most influential his  book the structure of scientific revolutions is one of the most cited academic books of all time kuhns contribution to the philosophy of science marked not only a break with several key positivist doctrines but also inaugurated a new style of philosophy of science that brought it closer to the history of science his account of the development of science held that science enjoys periods of stable growth punctuated by revisionary revolutions to this thesis kuhn added the

bibliography academic tools other internet resources related entries  life and career thomas kuhns academic life started in physics he then switched to history of science and as his career developed he moved over to philosophy of science although retaining a strong interest in the history of physics in  he graduated from harvard summa cum laude thereafter he spent the remainder of the war years in research related to radar at harvard and then in europe he gained his masters degree in physics in  and his doctorate in  also in physics concerning an application of quantum mechanics to solid state physics kuhn was elected to the prestigious society of fellows at harvard another of whose members was w v quine at this time and until  kuhn taught a class in science for undergraduates in the humanities as part of the general education in science curriculum developed by james b conant the president of harvard this course was centred around historical case studies and this was kuhns first opportunity to study historical scientific texts in detail his initial bewilderment on reading the scientific work of aristotle was a formative experience followed as it was by a more or less sudden ability to understand aristotle properly undistorted by knowledge of subsequent science this led kuhn to concentrate on history of science and in due course he was appointed to an assistant professorship in general education and the history of science during this period his work focussed on eighteenth century matter theory and the early history of thermodynamics kuhn then turned to the history of astronomy and in  he published his first book the copernican revolution in  kuhn became a full professor at the university of california at berkeley having moved there in  to take up a post in history of science but in the philosophy department this enabled him to develop his interest in the philosophy of science at berkeley kuhns colleagues included stanley cavell who introduced kuhn to the works of wittgenstein and paul feyerabend with feyerabend kuhn discussed a draft of the structure of scientific revolutions which was published in  in the series “international encyclopedia of unified science” edited by otto neurath and rudolf carnap the central idea of this extraordinarily influential—and controversial—book is that the development of science is driven in normal periods of science by adherence to what kuhn called a ‘paradigm’ the functions of a paradigm are to supply puzzles for scientists to solve and to provide the tools for their solution a crisis in science arises when confidence is lost in the ability of the paradigm to solve particularly worrying puzzles called ‘anomalies’ crisis is followed by a scientific revolution if the existing paradigm is superseded by a rival kuhn claimed that science guided by one paradigm would be ‘incommensurable’ with science developed under a different paradigm by which is meant that there is no common measure for assessing the different scientific theories this thesis of incommensurability developed at the same time by feyerabend rules out certain kinds of comparison of the two theories and consequently rejects some traditional views of scientific development such as the view that later science builds on the knowledge contained within earlier theories or the view that later theories are closer approximations to the truth than earlier theories most of kuhns subsequent work in philosophy was spent in articulating and developing the ideas in the structure of scientific revolutions although some of these such as the thesis of incommensurability underwent transformation in the process according to kuhn himself   the structure of scientific revolutions first aroused interest among social scientists although it did in due course create the interest among philosophers that kuhn had intended and also before long among a much wider academic and general audience while acknowledging the importance of kuhns ideas the philosophical reception was nonetheless hostile for example dudley shaperes review  emphasized the relativist implications of kuhns ideas and this set the context for much subsequent philosophical discussion since the following of rules of logic of scientific method etc was regarded as the sine qua non of rationality kuhns claim that scientists do not employ rules in reaching their decisions appeared tantamount to the claim that science is irrational this was highlighted by his rejection of the distinction between discovery and justification denying that we can distinguish between the psychological process of thinking up an idea and the logical process of justifying its claim to truth and his emphasis on incommensurability the claim that certain kinds of comparison between theories are impossible the negative response among philosophers was exacerbated by an important naturalistic tendency in the structure of scientific revolutions that was then unfamiliar a particularly significant instance of this was kuhns insistence on the importance of the history of science for philosophy of science the opening sentence of the book reads “history if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or chronology could produce a decisive transformation in the image of science by which we are now possessed”   also significant and unfamiliar was kuhns appeal to psychological literature and examples such as linking theorychange with the changing appearance of a gestalt image in  kuhn left berkeley to take up the position of m taylor pyne professor of philosophy and history of science at princeton university in the following year an important event took place which helped promote kuhns profile further among philosophers an international colloquium in the philosophy of science was held at bedford college london one of the key events of the colloquium was intended to be a debate between kuhn and feyerabend with feyerabend promoting the critical rationalism that he shared with popper as it was feyerabend was ill and unable to attend and the papers delivered focussed on kuhns work john watkins took feyerabends place in a session chaired by popper the ensuing discussion to which popper and also margaret masterman and stephen toulmin contributed compared and contrasted the viewpoints of kuhn and popper and thereby helped illuminate the significance of kuhns approach papers from these discussants along with contributions from feyerabend and lakatos were published several years later in criticism and the growth of knowledge edited by lakatos and alan musgrave  the fourth volume of proceedings from this colloquium in the same year the second edition of the structure of scientific revolutions was published including an important postscript in which kuhn clarified his notion of paradigm this was in part in response to mastermans  criticism that kuhn had used ‘paradigm’ in a wide variety of ways in addition kuhn felt that critics had failed to appreciate the emphasis he placed upon the idea of a paradigm as an exemplar or model of puzzlesolving kuhn also for the first time explicitly gave his work an antirealist element by denying the coherence of the idea that theories could be regarded as more or less close to the truth a collection of kuhns essays in the philosophy and history of science was published in  with the title the essential tension taken from one of kuhns earliest essays in which he emphasizes the importance of tradition in science the following year saw the publication of his second historical monograph blackbody theory and the quantum discontinuity concerning the early history of quantum mechanics in  he was named laurence s rockefeller professor of philosophy at mit kuhn continued throughout the s and s to work on a variety of topics in both history and philosophy of science including the development of the concept of incommensurability and at the time of his death in  he was working on a second philosophical monograph dealing with among other matters an evolutionary conception of scientific change and concept acquisition in developmental psychology  the development of science in the structure of scientific revolutions kuhn paints a picture of the development of science quite unlike any that had gone before indeed before kuhn there was little by way of a carefully considered theoretically explained account of scientific change instead there was a conception of how science ought to develop that was a byproduct of the prevailing philosophy of science as well as a popular heroic view of scientific progress according to such opinions science develops by the addition of new truths to the stock of old truths or the increasing approximation of theories to the truth and in the odd case the correction of past errors such progress might accelerate in the hands of a particularly great scientist but progress itself is guaranteed by the scientific method in the s when kuhn began his historical studies of science the history of science was a young academic discipline even so it was becoming clear that scientific change was not always as straightforward as the standard traditional view would have it kuhn was the first and most important author to articulate a developed alternative account since the standard view dovetailed with the dominant positivistinfluenced philosophy of science a nonstandard view would have important consequences for the philosophy of science kuhn had little formal philosophical training but was nonetheless fully conscious of the significance of his innovation for philosophy and indeed he called his work ‘history for philosophical purposes’ kuhn   according to kuhn the development of a science is not uniform but has alternating ‘normal’ and ‘revolutionary’ or ‘extraordinary’ phases the revolutionary phases are not merely periods of accelerated progress but differ qualitatively from normal science normal science does resemble the standard cumulative picture of scientific progress on the surface at least kuhn describes normal science as ‘puzzlesolving’ a – while this term suggests that normal science is not dramatic its main purpose is to convey the idea that like someone doing a crossword puzzle or a chess problem or a jigsaw the puzzlesolver expects to have a reasonable chance of solving the puzzle that his doing so will depend mainly on his own ability and that the puzzle itself and its methods of solution will have a high degree of familiarity a puzzlesolver is not entering completely uncharted territory because its puzzles and their solutions are familiar and relatively straightforward normal science can expect to accumulate a growing stock of puzzlesolutions revolutionary science however is not cumulative in that according to kuhn scientific revolutions involve a revision to existing scientific belief or practice a  not all the achievements of the preceding period of normal science are preserved in a revolution and indeed a later period of science may find itself without an explanation for a phenomenon that in an earlier period was held to be successfully explained this feature of scientific revolutions has become known as ‘kuhnloss’ a – if as in the standard picture scientific revolutions are like normal science but better then revolutionary science will at all times be regarded as something positive to be sought promoted and welcomed revolutions are to be sought on poppers view also but not because they add to positive knowledge of the truth of theories but because they add to the negative knowledge that the relevant theories are false kuhn rejected both the traditional and popperian views in this regard he claims that normal science can succeed in making progress only if there is a strong commitment by the relevant scientific community to their shared theoretical beliefs values instruments and techniques and even metaphysics this constellation of shared commitments kuhn at one point calls a ‘disciplinary matrix’ a  although elsewhere he often uses the term ‘paradigm’ because commitment to the disciplinary matrix is a prerequisite for successful normal science an inculcation of that commitment is a key element in scientific training and in the formation of the mindset of a successful scientist this tension between the desire for innovation and the necessary conservativeness of most scientists was the subject of one of kuhns first essays in the theory of science “the essential tension”  the unusual emphasis on a conservative attitude distinguishes kuhn not only from the heroic element of the standard picture but also from popper and his depiction of the scientist forever attempting to refute her most important theories this conservative resistance to the attempted refutation of key theories means that revolutions are not sought except under extreme circumstances poppers philosophy requires that a single reproducible anomalous phenomenon be enough to result in the rejection of a theory popper  – kuhns view is that during normal science scientists neither test nor seek to confirm the guiding theories of their disciplinary matrix nor do they regard anomalous results as falsifying those theories it is only speculative puzzlesolutions that can be falsified in a popperian fashion during normal science b  rather anomalies are ignored or explained away if at all possible it is only the accumulation of particularly troublesome anomalies that poses a serious problem for the existing disciplinary matrix a particularly troublesome anomaly is one that undermines the practice of normal science for example an anomaly might reveal inadequacies in some commonly used piece of equipment perhaps by casting doubt on the underlying theory if much of normal science relies upon this piece of equipment normal science will find it difficult to continue with confidence until this anomaly is addressed a widespread failure in such confidence kuhn calls a ‘crisis’ a – the most interesting response to crisis will be the search for a revised disciplinary matrix a revision that will allow for the elimination of at least the most pressing anomalies and optimally the solution of many outstanding unsolved puzzles such a revision will be a scientific revolution according to popper the revolutionary overthrow of a theory is one that is logically required by an anomaly according to kuhn however there are no rules for deciding the significance of a puzzle and for weighing puzzles and their solutions against one another the decision to opt for a revision of a disciplinary matrix is not one that is rationally compelled nor is the particular choice of revision rationally compelled for this reason the revolutionary phase is particularly open to competition among differing ideas and rational disagreement about their relative merits kuhn does briefly mention that extrascientific factors might help decide the outcome of a scientific revolution—the nationalities and personalities of leading protagonists for example a – this suggestion grew in the hands of some sociologists and historians of science into the thesis that the outcome of a scientific revolution indeed of any step in the development of science is always determined by sociopolitical factors kuhn himself repudiated such ideas and his work makes it clear that the factors determining the outcome of a scientific dispute particularly in modern science are almost always to be found within science specifically in connexion with the puzzlesolving power of the competing ideas kuhn states that science does progress even through revolutions a ff the phenomenon of kuhnloss does in kuhns view rule out the traditional cumulative picture of progress the revolutionary search for a replacement paradigm is driven by the failure of the existing paradigm to solve certain important anomalies any replacement paradigm had better solve the majority of those puzzles or it will not be worth adopting in place of the existing paradigm at the same time even if there is some kuhnloss a worthy replacement must also retain much of the problemsolving power of its predecessor a  kuhn does clarify the point by asserting that the newer theory must retain pretty well all its predecessors power to solve quantitative problems it may however lose some qualitative explanatory power b  hence we can say that revolutions do bring with them an overall increase in puzzlesolving power the number and significance of the puzzles and anomalies solved by the revised paradigm exceeding the number and significance of the puzzlessolutions that are no longer available as a result of kuhnloss kuhn is quick to deny that there is any inference from such increases to improved nearness to the truth a – indeed he later denies that any sense can be made of the notion of nearness to the truth a  rather he favours an evolutionary view of scientific progress a – the evolutionary development of an organism might be seen as its response to a challenge set by its environment but that does not imply that there is some ideal form of the organism that it is evolving towards analogously science improves by allowing its theories to evolve in response to puzzles and progress is measured by its success in solving those puzzles it is not measured by its progress towards to an ideal true theory  the concept of a paradigm a mature science according to kuhn experiences alternating phases of normal science and revolutions in normal science the key theories instruments values and metaphysical assumptions that comprise the disciplinary matrix are kept fixed permitting the cumulative generation of puzzlesolutions whereas in a scientific revolution the disciplinary matrix undergoes revision in order to permit the solution of the more serious anomalous puzzles that disturbed the preceding period of normal science a particularly important part of kuhns thesis in the structure of scientific revolutions focuses upon one specific component of the disciplinary matrix this is the consensus on exemplary instances of scientific research these exemplars of good science are what kuhn refers to when he uses the term ‘paradigm’ in a narrower sense he cites aristotles analysis of motion ptolemys computations of plantery positions lavoisiers application of the balance and maxwells mathematization of the electromagnetic field as paradigms a  exemplary instances of science are typically to be found in books and papers and so kuhn often also describes great texts as paradigms—ptolemys almagest lavoisiers traité élémentaire de chimie and newtons principia mathematica and opticks a  such texts contain not only the key theories and laws but also—and this is what makes them paradigms—the applications of those theories in the solution of important problems along with the new experimental or mathematical techniques such as the chemical balance in traité élémentaire de chimie and the calculus in principia mathematica employed in those applications in the postscript to the second edition of the structure of scientific revolutions kuhn says of paradigms in this sense that they are “the most novel and least understood aspect of this book” a  the claim that the consensus of a disciplinary matrix is primarily agreement on paradigmsasexemplars is intended to explain the nature of normal science and the process of crisis revolution and renewal of normal science it also explains the birth of a mature science kuhn describes an immature science in what he sometimes calls its ‘preparadigm’ period as lacking consensus competing schools of thought possess differing procedures theories even metaphysical presuppositions consequently there is little opportunity for collective progress even localized progress by a particular school is made difficult since much intellectual energy is put into arguing over the fundamentals with other schools instead of developing a research tradition however progress is not impossible and one school may make a breakthrough whereby the shared problems of the competing schools are solved in a particularly impressive fashion this success draws away adherents from the other schools and a widespread consensus is formed around the new puzzlesolutions this widespread consensus now permits agreement on fundamentals for a problemsolution will embody particular theories procedures and instrumentation scientific language metaphysics and so forth consensus on the puzzlesolution will thus bring consensus on these other aspects of a disciplinary matrix also the successful puzzlesolution now a paradigm puzzlesolution will not solve all problems indeed it will probably raise new puzzles for example the theories it employs may involve a constant whose value is not known with precision the paradigm puzzlesolution may employ approximations that could be improved it may suggest other puzzles of the same kind it may suggest new areas for investigation generating new puzzles is one thing that the paradigm puzzlesolution does helping solve them is another in the most favourable scenario the new puzzles raised by the paradigm puzzlesolution can be addressed and answered using precisely the techniques that the paradigm puzzlesolution employs and since the paradigm puzzlesolution is accepted as a great achievement these very similar puzzlesolutions will be accepted as successful solutions also this is why kuhn uses the terms ‘exemplar’ and ‘paradigm’ for the novel puzzlesolution which crystallizes consensus is regarded and used as a model of exemplary science in the research tradition it inaugurates a paradigmasexemplar fulfils three functions i it suggests new puzzles ii it suggests approaches to solving those puzzles iii it is the standard by which the quality of a proposed puzzlesolution can be measured a – in each case it is similarity to the exemplar that is the scientists’ guide that normal science proceeds on the basis of perceived similarity to exemplars is an important and distinctive feature of kuhns new picture of scientific development the standard view explained the cumulative addition of new knowledge in terms of the application of the scientific method allegedly the scientific method encapsulates the rules of scientific rationality it may be that those rules could not account for the creative side of science—the generation of new hypotheses the latter was thus designated ‘the context of discovery’ leaving the rules of rationality to decide in the ‘context of justification’ whether a new hypothesis should in the light of the evidence be added to the stock of accepted theories kuhn rejected the distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification a  and correspondingly rejected the standard account of each as regards the context of discovery the standard view held that the philosophy of science had nothing to say on the issue of the functioning of the creative imagination but kuhns paradigms do provide a partial explanation since training with exemplars enables scientists to see new puzzlesituations in terms of familiar puzzles and hence enables them to see potential solutions to their new puzzles more important for kuhn was the way his account of the context of justification diverged from the standard picture the functioning of exemplars is intended explicitly to contrast with the operation of rules the key determinant in the acceptability of a proposed puzzlesolution is its similarity to the paradigmatic puzzlesolutions perception of similarity cannot be reduced to rules and a fortiori cannot be reduced to rules of rationality this rejection of rules of rationality was one of the factors that led kuhns critics to accuse him of irrationalism—regarding science as irrational in this respect at least the accusation is wide of the mark for to deny that some cognitive process is the outcome of applying rules of rationality is not to imply that it is an irrational process the perception of similarity in appearance between two members of the same family also cannot be reduced to the application of rules of rationality kuhns innovation in the structure of scientific revolutions was to suggest that a key element in cognition in science operates in the same fashion  incommensurability and worldchange the standard empiricist conception of theory evaluation regards our judgment of the epistemic quality of a theory to be a matter of applying rules of method to the theory and the evidence kuhns contrasting view is that we judge the quality of a theory and its treatment of the evidence by comparing it to a paradigmatic theory the standards of assessment therefore are not permanent theoryindependent rules they are not rules because they involve perceived relations of similarity of puzzlesolution to a paradigm they are not theoryindependent since they involve comparison to a paradigm theory they are not permanent since the paradigm may change in a scientific revolution for example to many in the seventeenth century newtons account of gravitation involving action at a distance with no underlying explanation seemed a poor account in that respect at least when compared for example to ptolemys explanation of the motion of the planets in terms of contiguous crystalline spheres or to descartes’ explanation in terms of vortices however later once newtons theory had become accepted and the paradigm by which later theories were judged the lack of an underlying mechanism for a fundamental force was regarded as no objection as for example in the case of coulombs law of electrostatic attraction indeed in the latter case the very similarity of coulombs equation to newtons was taken to be in its favour consequently comparison between theories will not be as straightforward as the standard empiricist picture would have it since the standards of evaluation are themselves subject to change this sort of difficulty in theory comparison is an instance of what kuhn and feyerabend called ‘incommensurability’ theories are incommensurable when they share no common measure thus if paradigms are the measures of attempted puzzlesolutions then puzzlesolutions developed in different eras of normal science will be judged by comparison to differing paradigms and so lack a common measure the term ‘incommensurable’ derives from a mathematical use according to which the side and diagonal of a square are incommensurable in virtue of there being no unit that can be used to measure both exactly kuhn stressed that incommensurability did not mean noncomparability just as the side and diagonal of a square are comparable in many respects even so it is clear that at the very least kuhns incommensurability thesis would make theory comparison rather more difficult than had commonly been supposed and in some cases impossible we can distinguish three types of incommensurability in kuhns remarks  methodological—there is no common measure because the methods of comparison and evaluation change  perceptualobservational—observational evidence cannot provide a common basis for theory comparison since perceptual experience is theorydependent  semantic—the fact that the languages of theories from different periods of normal science may not be intertranslatable presents an obstacle to the comparison of those theories see sankey  for a useful discussion of kuhns changing accounts of incommensurability  methodological incommensurability the incommensurability illustrated above whereby puzzlesolutions from different eras of normal science are evaluated by reference to different paradigms is methodological incommensurability another source of methodological incommensurability is the fact that proponents of competing paradigms may not agree on which problems a candidate paradigm should solve a  in general the factors that determine our choices of theory whether puzzlesolutions or potential paradigm theories are not fixed and neutral but vary and are dependent in particular on the disciplinary matrix within which the scientist is working indeed since decision making is not rulegoverned or algorithmic there is no guarantee that those working within the same disciplinary matrix must agree on their evaluation of theory a  although in such cases the room for divergence will be less than when the disputants operate within different disciplinary matrices despite the possibility of divergence there is nonetheless widespread agreement on the desirable features of a new puzzlesolution or theory kuhn  – identifies five characteristics that provide the shared basis for a choice of theory  accuracy  consistency both internal and with other relevant currently accepted theories  scope its consequences should extend beyond the data it is required to explain  simplicity organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena  fruitfulness for further research even though these are for kuhn constitutive of science c    they cannot determine scientific choice first which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable eg does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form secondly these criteria are imprecise and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold thirdly there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another especially when they conflict  perception observational incommensurability and worldchange an important focus of kuhns interest in the structure of scientific revolutions was on the nature of perception and how it may be that what a scientist observes can change as a result of scientific revolution he developed what has become known as the thesis of the theorydependence of observation building on the work of n r hanson  while also referring to psychological studies carried out by his harvard colleagues leo postman and jerome bruner bruner and postman  the standard positivist view was that observation provides the neutral arbiter between competing theories the thesis that kuhn and hanson promoted denied this holding that the nature of observation may be influenced by prior beliefs and experiences consequently it cannot be expected that two scientists when observing the same scene will make the same theoryneutral observations kuhn asserts that galileo and an aristotelian when both looking at a pendulum will see different things see quoted passage below the theorydependence of observation by rejecting the role of observation as a theoryneutral arbiter among theories provides another source of incommensurability methodological incommensurability § above denies that there are universal methods for making inferences from the data the theorydependence of observation means that even if there were agreed methods of inference and interpretation incommensurability could still arise since scientists might disagree on the nature of the observational data themselves kuhn expresses or builds on the idea that participants in different disciplinary matrices will see the world differently by claiming that their worlds are different in a sense i am unable to explicate further the proponents of competing paradigms practice their trades in different worlds one contains constrained bodies that fall slowly the other pendulums that repeat their motions again and again in one solutions are compounds in the other mixtures one is embedded in a flat the other in a curved matrix of space practicing in different worlds the two groups of scientists see different things when they look from the same point in the same direction a  remarks such as these gave some commentators the impression that kuhn was a strong kind of constructivist holding that the way the world literally is depends on which scientific theory is currently accepted kuhn however denied any constructivist import to his remarks on worldchange the closest kuhn came to constructivism was to acknowledge a parallel with kantian idealism which is discussed below in section  kuhn likened the change in the phenomenal world to the gestaltswitch that occurs when one sees the duckrabbit diagram first as representing a duck then as representing a rabbit although he himself acknowledged that he was not sure whether the gestalt case was just an analogy or whether it illustrated some more general truth about the way the mind works that encompasses the scientific case too  kuhns early semantic incommensurability thesis although the theorydependence of observation plays a significant role in the structure of scientific revolutions neither it nor methodological incommensurability could account for all the phenomena that kuhn wanted to capture with the notion of incommensurability some of his own examples are rather stretched—for instance he says lavoisier saw oxygen where priestley saw dephlogisticated air describing this as a ‘transformation of vision’ a  moreover observation—if conceived of as a form of perception—does not play a significant part in every science kuhn wanted to explain his own experience of reading aristotle which first left him with the impression that aristotle was an inexplicably poor scientist kuhn  but careful study led to a change in his understanding that allowed him to see that aristotle was indeed an excellent scientist this could not simply be a matter of literally perceiving things differently kuhn took the incommensurability that prevented him from properly understanding aristotle to be at least partly a linguistic semantic matter indeed kuhn spent much of his career after the structure of scientific revolutions attempting to articulate a semantic conception of incommensurability in the structure of scientific revolutions kuhn asserts that there are important shifts in the meanings of key terms as a consequence of a scientific revolution for example kuhn says … the physical referents of these einsteinian concepts are by no means identical with those of the newtonian concepts that bear the same name newtonian mass is conserved einsteinian is convertible with energy only at low relative velocities may the two be measured in the same way and even then they must not be conceived to be the same a  this is important because a standard conception of the transition from classical to relativistic physics is that although einsteins theory of relativity supersedes newtons theory what we have is an improvement or generalization whereby newtons theory is a special case of einsteins to a close approximation we can therefore say that the later theory is closer to the truth than the older theory kuhns view that ‘mass’ as used by newton cannot be translated by ‘mass’ as used by einstein allegedly renders this kind of comparison impossible hence incommensurability is supposed to rule out convergent realism the view that science shows ever improving approximation to the truth kuhn also thinks for independent reasons that the very ideas of matching the truth and similarity to the truth are incoherent a  kuhns view as expressed in the passage quoted above depends upon meaning holism—the claim that the meanings of terms are interrelated in such a way that changing the meaning of one term results in changes in the meanings of related terms “to make the transition to einsteins universe the whole conceptual web whose strands are space time matter force and so on had to be shifted and laid down again on nature whole” a  the assumption of meaning holism is a long standing one in kuhns work one source for this is the later philosophy of wittgenstein another not unrelated source is the assumption of holism in the philosophy of science that is consequent upon the positivist conception of theoretical meaning according to the latter it is not the function of the theoretical part of scientific language to refer to and describe unobserved entities only observational sentences directly describe the world and this accounts for them having the meaning that they do theories permit the deduction of observational sentences this is what gives theoretical expressions their meaning theoretical statements cannot however be reduced to observational ones this is because first theoretical propositions are collectively involved in the deduction of observational statements rather than singly secondly theories generate dispositional statements eg about the solubility of a substance about how they would appear if observed under certain circumstances etc and dispositional statements being modal are not equivalent to any truthfunction of nonmodal observation statements consequently the meaning of a theoretical sentence is not equivalent to the meaning of any observational sentence or combination of observational sentences the meaning of a theoretical term is a product of two factors the relationship of the theory or theories of which it is a part to its observational consequences and the role that particular term plays within those theories this is the doublelanguage model of the language of science and was the standard picture of the relationship of a scientific theory to the world when kuhn wrote the structure of scientific revolutions kuhns challenge to it lay not in rejecting the antirealism implicit in the view that theories do not refer to the world but rather in undermining the assumption that the relationship of observation sentence to the world is unproblematic by insisting on the theorydependence of observation kuhn in effect argued that the holism of theoretical meaning is shared by apparently observational terms also and for this reason the problem of incommensurability cannot be solved by recourse to theoryneutral observation sentences although it is true that kuhn uses the expression ‘physical referent’ in the passage quoted above this should not be taken to mean an independently existing worldly entity if that were the case kuhn would be committed to the worldly existence of both newtonian mass and einsteinian mass which are nonetheless not the same it is implausible that kuhn intended to endorse such a view a better interpretation is to understand kuhn as taking reference in this context to be a relation between a term and a hypothetical rather than worldly entity reference of anything like the fregean worldly kind plays no part in kuhns thinking again this may be seen as a reflection of the influence of one or other or both of the later wittgensteinian downplaying of reference and of the positivist view that theories are not descriptions of the world but are in one way or another tools for the organization or prediction of observations  kuhns later semantic incommensurability thesis although kuhn asserted a semantic incommensurability thesis in the structure of scientific revolutions he did not there articulate or argue for the thesis in detail this he attempted in subsequent work with the result that the nature of the thesis changed over time the heart of the incommensurability thesis after the structure of scientific revolutions is the idea that certain kinds of translation are impossible early on kuhn drew a parallel with quines thesis of the indeterminacy of translation a  c  according to the latter if we are translating one language into another there are inevitably a multitude of ways of providing a translation that is adequate to the behaviour of the speakers none of the translations is the uniquely correct one and in quines view there is no such thing as the meaning of the words to be translated it was nonetheless clear that quines thesis was rather far from kuhns thesis indeed that they are incompatible first kuhn thought that incommensurability was a matter of there being no fully adequate translation whereas quines thesis involved the availability of multiple translations secondly kuhn does believe that the translated expressions do have a meaning whereas quine denies this thirdly kuhn later went on to say that unlike quine he does not think that reference is inscrutable—it is just very difficult to recover   subsequently kuhn developed the view that incommensurability arises from differences in classificatory schemes this is taxonomic incommensurability a field of science is governed by a taxonomy which divides its subject matter into kinds associated with a taxonomy is a lexical network—a network of related terms a significant scientific change will bring with it an alteration in the lexical network which in turn will lead to a realignment of the taxonomy of the field the terms of the new and old taxonomies will not be intertranslatable the problematic nature of translation arises from two assumptions first as we have seen kuhn assumes that meaning is locally holistic a change in the meaning of one part of the lexical structure will result in a change to all its parts this would rule out preservation of the translatability of taxonomies by redefining the changed part in terms of the unchanged part secondly kuhn adopts the ‘nooverlap’ principle which states that categories in a taxonomy must be hierarchically organised if two categories have members in common then one must be fully included within the other otherwise they are disjoint—they cannot simply overlap this rules out the possibility of an allencompassing taxonomy that incorporates both the original and the changed taxonomies ian hacking  relates this to the worldchange thesis after a revolution the world of individuals remains as it was but scientists now work in a world of new kinds kuhn continued to develop his conceptual approach to incommensurability at the time of his death he had made considerable progress on a book in which he related incommensurability to issues in developmental psychology and concept acquisition  history of science kuhns historical work covered several topics in the history of physics and astronomy during the s his focus was primarily on the early theory of heat and the work of sadie carnot however his first book concerned the copernican revolution in planetary astronomy  this book grew out of the teaching he had done on james conants general education in science curriculum at harvard but also presaged some of the ideas of the structure of scientific revolutions in detailing the problems with the ptolemaic system and copernicus’ solution to them kuhn showed two things first he demonstrated that aristotelian science was genuine science and that those working within that tradition in particular those working on ptolemaic astronomy were engaged in an entirely reasonable and recognizably scientific project secondly kuhn showed that copernicus was himself far more indebted to that tradition than had typically been recognized thus the popular view that copernicus was a modern scientist who overthrew an unscientific and longoutmoded viewpoint is mistaken both by exaggerating the difference between copernicus and the ptolemaic astronomers and in underestimating the scientific credentials of work carried out before copernicus this mistaken view—a product of the distortion caused by our current state of knowledge—can be rectified only by seeing the activities of copernicus and his predecessors in the light of the puzzles presented to them by tradition that they inevitably had to work with while kuhn does acknowledge the influence of causes outside science such as a resurgence in sun worship a – he nonetheless emphasizes the fact that astronomers were responding primarily to problems raised within science what appealed to them in copernicus’ model was its ability to do away with ad hoc devices in ptolemys system such as the equant to explain key phenomena in a pleasing fashion the observed retrograde motion of the planets and to explain away otherwise inexplicable coincidences in ptolemys system such as the alignment of the sun and the centres of the epicycles of the inferior planets in the s kuhns historical work turned toward the early history of quantum theory culminating in his book blackbody theory and the quantum discontinuity according to classical physics a particle could possess any energy in a continuous range and if it changes energy it does so in a continuous fashion possessing at some point in time every energy between the initial and final energy states modern quantum theory denies both these classical principles energy is quantised—a particle may possess only one of a set of discrete energies consequently if it changes in energy from one value to the next permitted value it does so discontinuously jumping straight from one energy to the other without taking any of the intermediate ‘forbidden’ values in order to explain the distribution of energy within a cavity blackbody radiation planck used the device of dividing up the energy states into multiples of the unit or ‘quantum’ hν where ν is the frequency of radiation and h is what subsequently became known as plancks constant planck did this in order to employ a statistical technique of boltzmanns whereby the range of possible continuous energies is divided into ‘cells’ of similar energies that could be treated together for mathematical purposes kuhn notes that planck was puzzled that in carrying out his derivation only by fixing the cell size at hν could he get the result he wanted—the technique should have worked for any way of dividing the cells so long as they were small enough but not too small this work of plancks was carried out in the period – which is the date tradition has accorded to the invention of the quantum concept however argued kuhn planck did not have in mind a genuine physical discontinuity of energies until  which is after albert einstein and paul ehrenfest had themselves emphasized it in – many readers were surprised not to find mention of paradigms or incommensurability kuhn later added an afterword “revisiting planck” explaining that he had not repudiated or ignored those ideas but that they were implicit in the argument he gave indeed the whole essay may be seen as a demonstration of an incommensurability between the mature quantum theory and the early quantum theory of planck which was still rooted in classical statistical physics in particular the very term ‘quantum’ changed its meaning between its introduction by planck and its later use kuhn argues that the modern quantum concept was introduced first not by planck but by einstein furthermore this fact is hidden both by the continued use of the same term and by the same distortion of history that has affected our conception of ptolemy and copernicus as in copernicus’ case planck has been seen as more revolutionary than in fact he was in plancks case however this misconception was also shared by planck himself later in life  criticism and influence kuhns work met with a largely critical reception among philosophers some of this criticism became muted as kuhns work became better understood and as his own thinking underwent transformation at the same time other developments in philosophy opened up new avenues for criticism that criticism has largely focussed on two areas first it has been argued that kuhns account of the development of science is not entirely accurate secondly critics have attacked kuhns notion of incommensurability arguing that either it does not exist or if it does exist it is not a significant problem despite this criticism kuhns work has been hugely influential both within philosophy and outside it the structure of scientific revolutions was an important stimulus to what has since become known as science studies in particular the sociology of scientific knowledge ssk  scientific change in the structure of scientific revolutions periods of normal science and revolutionary science are clearly distinguished in particular paradigms and their theories are not questioned and not changed in normal science whereas they are questioned and are changed in revolutionary science thus a revolution is by definition revisionary and normal science is not as regards paradigms furthermore normal science does not suffer from the conceptual discontinuities that lead to incommensurability whereas revolutions do this gives the impression confirmed by kuhns examples that revolutions are particularly significant and reasonably rare episodes in the history of science this picture has been questioned for its accuracy stephen toulmin  argues that a more realistic picture shows that revisionary changes in science are far more common and correspondingly less dramatic than kuhn supposes and that perfectly ‘normal’ science experiences these changes also kuhn could reply that such revisions are not revisions to the paradigm but to the nonparadigm puzzlesolutions provided by normal science but that in turn requires a clear distinction between paradigmatic and nonparadigmatic components of science a distinction that arguably kuhn has not supplied in any detail at the same time by making revisionary change a necessary condition of revolutionary science kuhn ignores important discoveries and developments that are widely regarded as revolutionary such as the discovery of the structure of dna and the revolution in molecular biology kuhns view is that discoveries and revolutions come about only as a consequence of the appearance of anomalies yet it is also clear that a discovery might come about in the course of normal science and initiate a ‘revolution’ in a nonkuhnian sense in a field because of the unexpected insight it provides and the way it opens up opportunities for new avenues of research the doublehelical structure of dna was not expected but immediately suggested a mechanism for the duplication of genetic information eg in mitosis which had enormous consequences for subsequent biological research  incommensurability kuhns incommensurability thesis presented a challenge not only to positivist conceptions of scientific change but also to realist ones for a realist conception of scientific progress also wishes to assert that by and large later science improves on earlier science in particular by approaching closer to the truth a standard realist response from the late s was to reject the antirealism and antireferentialism shared by both kuhns picture and the preceding doublelanguage model if we do take theories to be potential descriptions of the world involving reference to worldly entities kind and properties then the problems raised by incommensurability largely evaporate as we have seen kuhn thinks that we cannot properly say that einsteins theory is an improvement on newtons in the sense that the latter as deals reasonably accurately only with a special case of the former whether or not the key terms such as ‘mass’ in the two theories differ in meaning a realist and referentialist approach to theories permits one to say that einsteins theory is closer to the truth than newtons for truth and nearness to the truth depend only on reference and not on sense two terms can differ in sense yet share the same reference and correspondingly two sentences may relate to one another as regards truth without their sharing terms with the same sense and so even if we retain a holism about the sense of theoretical terms and allow that revolutions lead to shifts in sense there is no direct inference from this to a shift in reference consequently there is no inference to the inadmissibility of the comparison of theories with respect to their truthnearness while this referentialist response to the incommensurability thesis was initially framed in fregean terms scheffler  it received further impetus from the work of kripke  and putnam b which argued that reference could be achieved without anything akin to fregean sense and that the natural kind terms of science exemplified this sensefree reference in particular causal theories of reference permit continuity of reference even through fairly radical theoretical change they do not guarantee continuity in reference and changes in reference can occur on some causal theories eg gareth evanss  arguing that they do occur would require more however than merely pointing to a change in theory rather it seems cases of reference change must be identified and argued for on a case by case basis therefore if taken to encompass terms for quantities and properties such as ‘mass’ the changes that kuhn identified as changes in meaning eg those involved in the shift from newtonian to relativistic physics would not necessarily be changes that bear on reference nor consequently on comparison for nearness to the truth the simple causal theory of reference does have its problems such as explaining the referential mechanism of empty theoretical terms egcaloric and phlogiston cf enç  nola  causaldescriptive theories which allow for a descriptive component tackle such problems while retaining the key idea that referential continuity is possible despite radical theory change kroon  sankey  of course the referentialist response shows only that reference can be retained not that it must be consequently it is only a partial defence of realism against semantic incommensurability a further component of the defence of realism against incommensurability must be an epistemic one for referentialism shows that a term can retain reference and hence that the relevant theories may be such that the later constitutes a better approximation to the truth than the earlier nonetheless it may not be possible for philosophers or others to know that there has been such progress methodological incommensurability in particular seems to threaten the possibility of this knowledge kuhn thinks that in order to be in a position to compare theories from older and more recent periods of normal science one needs a perspective external to each and indeed any era of science–what he calls an ‘archimedean platform’   however we never are able to escape from our current perspective a realist response to this kind of incommensurability may appeal to externalist or naturalized epistemology these related approaches reject the idea that for a method to yield knowledge it must be independent of any particular theory perspective or historicalcognitive circumstance so long as the method has an appropriate kind of reliability it can generate knowledge contrary to the internalist view characteristic of the positivists and it appears shared by kuhn the reliability of a method does not need to be one that must be evaluable independently of any particular scientific perspective it is not the case for example that the reliability of a method used in science must be justifiable by a priori means thus the methods developed in one era may indeed generate knowledge including knowledge that some previous era got certain matters wrong or right but only to a certain degree a naturalized epistemology may add that science itself is in the business of investigating and developing methods as science develops we would expect its methods to change and develop also  kuhn and social science kuhns influence outside of professional philosophy of science may have been even greater than it was within it the social sciences in particular took up kuhn with enthusiasm there are primarily two reasons for this first kuhns picture of science appeared to permit a more liberal conception of what science is than hitherto one that could be taken to include disciplines such as sociology and psychoanalysis secondly kuhns rejection of rules as determining scientific outcomes appeared to permit appeal to other factors external to science in explaining why a scientific revolution took the course that it did the status as genuine sciences of what we now call the social and human sciences has widely been held in doubt such disciplines lack the remarkable track record of established natural sciences and seem to differ also in the methods they employ more specifically they fail by prekuhnian philosophical criteria of sciencehood on the one hand positivists required of a science that it should be verifiable by reference to its predictive successes on the other poppers criterion was that a science should be potentially falsifiable by a prediction of the theory yet psychoanalysis sociology and even economics have difficulty in making precise predictions at all let alone ones that provide for clear confirmation or unambiguous refutation kuhns picture of a mature science as being dominated by a paradigm that generated sui generis puzzles and criteria for assessing solutions to them could much more easily accommodate these disciplines for example popper famously complained that psychoanalysis could not be scientific because it resists falsification kuhns account argues that resisting falsification is precisely what every disciplinary matrix in science does even disciplines that could not claim to be dominated by a settled paradigm but were beset by competing schools with different fundamental ideas could appeal to kuhns description of the preparadigm state of a science in its infancy consequently kuhns analysis was popular among those seeking legitimacy as science and consequently kudos and funding for their new disciplines kuhn himself did not especially promote such extensions of his views and indeed cast doubt upon them he denied that psychoanalysis is a science and argued that there are reasons why some fields within the social sciences could not sustain extended periods of puzzlesolving normal science b although he says the natural sciences involve interpretation just as human and social sciences do one difference is that hermeneutic reinterpretation the search for new and deeper intepretations is the essence of many social scientific enterprises this contrasts with the natural sciences where an established and unchanging interpretation eg of the heavens is a precondition of normal science reintepretation is the result of a scientific revolution and is typically resisted rather than actively sought another reason why regular reinterpretation is part of the human sciences and not the natural sciences is that social and political systems are themselves changing in ways that call for new interpretations whereas the subject matter of the natural sciences is constant in the relevant respects permitting a puzzlesolving tradition as well as a standing source of revolutiongenerating anomalies a rather different influence on social science was kuhns influence on the development of social studies of science itself in particular the ‘sociology of scientific knowledge’ a central claim of kuhns work is that scientists do not make their judgments as the result of consciously or unconsciously following rules their judgments are nonetheless tightly constrained during normal science by the example of the guiding paradigm during a revolution they are released from these constraints though not completely consequently there is a gap left for other factors to explain scientific judgments kuhn himself suggests in the structure of scientific revolutions that sun worship may have made kepler a copernican and that in other cases facts about an individuals life history personality or even nationality and reputation may play a role a  later kuhn repeated the point with the additional examples of german romanticism which disposed certain scientists to recognize and accept energy conservation and british social thought which enabled acceptance of darwinism c  such suggestions were taken up as providing an opportunity for a new kind of study of science showing how social and political factors external to science influence the outcome of scientific debates in what has become known as social constructivismconstructionism eg pickering  this influence is taken to be central not marginal and to extend to the very content of accepted theories kuhns claim and its exploitation can be seen as analogous to or even an instance of the exploitation of the alleged underdetermination of theory by evidence cf kuhn   feminists and social theorists eg nelson  have argued that the fact that the evidence or in kuhns case the shared values of science do not fix a single choice of theory allows external factors to determine the final outcome see martin  and schiebinger  for feminist social constructivism furthermore the fact that kuhn identified values as what guide judgment opens up the possibility that scientists ought to employ different values as has been argued by feminist and postcolonial writers eg longino  kuhn himself however showed only limited sympathy for such developments in his “the trouble with the historical philosophy of science”  kuhn derides those who take the view that in the ‘negotiations’ that determine the accepted outcome of an experiment or its theoretical significance all that counts are the interests and power relations among the participants kuhn targeted the proponents of the strong programme in the sociology of scientific knowledge with such comments and even if this is not entirely fair to the strong programme it reflects kuhns own view that the primary determinants of the outcome of a scientific episode are to be found within science external history of science seeks causes of scientific change in social political religious and other developments of science kuhn sees his work as “pretty straight internalist”   first the five values kuhn ascribes to all science are in his view constitutive of science an enterprise could have different values but it would not be science c    secondly when a scientist is influenced by individual or other factors in applying these values or in coming to a judgment when these values are not decisive those influencing factors will typically themselves come from within science especially in modern professionalized science personality may play a role in the acceptance of a theory because for example one scientist is more riskaverse than another c —but that is still a relationship to the scientific evidence even when reputation plays a part it is typically scientific reputation that encourages the community to back the opinion of an eminent scientist thirdly in a large community such variable factors will tend to cancel out kuhn supposes that individual differences are normally distributed and that a judgment corresponding to the mean of the distribution will also correspond to the judgment that would hypothetically be demanded by the rules of scientific method as traditionally conceived c  moreover the existence of differences of response within the leeway provided by shared values is crucial to science since it permits “rational men to disagree” c  and thus to commit themselves to rival theories thus the looseness of values and the differences they permit “may    appear an indispensable means of spreading the risk which the introduction or support of novelty always entails” ibid  recent developments even if kuhns work has not remained at the centre of the philosophy of science a number of philosophers have continued to find it fruitful and have sought to develop it in a number of directions paul hoyningenhuene  as a result of working with kuhn developed an important neokantian interpretation of his discussion of perception and worldchange we may distinguish between the worldinitself and the ‘world’ of our perceptual and related experiences the phenomenal world this corresponds to the kantian distinction between noumena and phenomena the important difference between kant and kuhn is that kuhn takes the general form of phenomena not to be fixed but changeable a shift in paradigm can lead via the theorydependence of observation to a difference in ones experiences of things and thus to a change in ones phenomenal world this change in phenomenal world articulates the sense in which the world changes as a result of a scientific revolution while also capturing kuhns claims about the theorydependence of observation and consequent incommensurability hoyningenhuene  a rather different direction in which kuhns thought has been developed proposes that his ideas might be illuminated by advances in cognitive psychology one the one hand work on conceptual structures can help understand what might be correct in the incommensurability thesis nersessian   several authors have sought in different ways to emphasize what they take to be the wittgensteinian element in kuhns thought for example kindi  sharrock and read  andersen barker and chen    draw in particular on kuhns version of wittgensteins notion of family resemblance kuhn articulates a view according to which the extension of a concept is determined by similarity to a set of exemplary cases rather than by an intension andersen barker and chen argue that kuhns view is supported by the work of rosch  rosch and mervis  on prototypes furthermore this approach can be developed in the context of dynamic frames barsalou  which can then explain the phenomenon of semantic incommensurability on the other hand the psychology of analogical thinking and cognitive habits may also inform our understanding of the concept of a paradigm kuhn himself tells us that “the paradigm as shared example is the central element of what i now take to be the most novel and least understood aspect of the structure of scientific revolutions” a  kuhn however failed to develop the paradigm concept in his later work beyond an early application of its semantic aspects to the explanation of incommensurability nonetheless other philosophers principally howard margolis   have developed the idea that habits of mind formed by training with paradigmsasexemplars are an important component in understanding the nature of scientific development as explained by nickles b and bird  this is borne out by recent work by psychologists on modelbased and analogical thinking  assessment assessing kuhns significance presents a conundrum unquestionably he was one of the most influential philosophers and historians of science of the twentieth century his most obvious achievement was to have been a major force in bringing about the final demise of logical positivism nonetheless there is no characteristically kuhnian school that carries on his positive work it is as if he himself brought about a revolution but did not supply the replacement paradigm for a period in the s and s it looked as if there was a kuhnian paradigm ‘historical philosophy of science’ flourishing especially in newly formed departments of history and philosophy of science but as far as the history of science and science studies more generally are concerned kuhn repudiated at least the more radical developments made in his name indeed part of kuhns fame must be due to the fact that both his supporters and his detractors took his work to be more revolutionary antirationalist relativist than it really was turning to the philosophy of science it was clear by the end of the s that the centreground was now occupied by a new realism one that took on board lessons from general philosophy of language and epistemology in particular referentialist semantics and a belief in the possibility of objective knowledge and justification there is some irony therefore in the fact that it was the demise of logical positivismempiricism that led to the rebirth of scientific realism along with causal and externalist semantics and epistemology positions that kuhn rejected one way of understanding this outcome is to see that kuhns relationship on the one hand to positivism and on the other hand to realism places him in an interesting position kuhns thesis of the theorydependence of observation parallels related claims by realists in the hands of realists the thesis is taken to undermine the theoryobservation dichotomy that permitted positivists to take an antirealist attitude to theories in the hands of kuhn however the thesis is taken in effect to extend antirealism from theories to observation also this in turn fuels the thesis of incommensurability the fact that incommensurability is founded upon a response to positivism diametrically opposed to the realist response explains why much of kuhns later philosophical work which developed the incommensurability thesis has had little impact on the majority of philosophers of science the explanation of scientific development in terms of paradigms was not only novel but radical too insofar as it gives a naturalistic explanation of beliefchange naturalism was not in the early s the familiar part of philosophical landscape that it has subsequently become kuhns explanation contrasted with explanations in terms of rules of method or confirmation falsification etc that most philosophers of science took to be constitutive of rationality furthermore the relevant disciplines psychology cognitive science artificial intelligence were not then advanced enough to to support kuhns contentions concerning paradigms or those disciplines were antithetical to kuhns views in the case of classical ai now that naturalism has become an accepted component of philosophy there has recently been interest in reassessing kuhns work in the light of developments in the relevant sciences many of which provide corroboration for kuhns claim that science is driven by relations of perceived similarity and analogy it may yet be that a characteristically kuhnian thesis will play a prominent

a physicist at harvard university became an historian and philosopher of science through the support of harvard’s president james conant in  kuhn’s renowned the structure of scientific revolutions structure helped to inaugurate a revolution—the s historiographic revolution—by providing a new image of science for kuhn scientific revolutions involved paradigm shifts that punctuated periods of stasis or normal science towards the end of his career however kuhn underwent a paradigm shift of his own—from a historical philosophy of science to an evolutionary one in this article kuhn’s philosophy of science is reconstructed chronologically to that end the following questions are entertained what was kuhn’s early life and career what was the road towards structure what is structure why did kuhn revise structure what was the road kuhn took after structure at the heart of the answers to these questions is the person of kuhn himself especially the intellectual and social context in which he practiced his trade this chronological reconstruction of kuhn’s philosophy begins with his work in the s on physical theory in the lowell lectures and on the copernican revolution and ends with his work in the s on an evolutionary philosophy of science rather than present kuhn’s philosophy as a finished product this approach endeavors to capture it in the process of its formation so as to represent it accurately and faithfully table of contents early life and career the road to structure the lowell lectures the copernican revolution the last mile to structure the structure of scientific revolutions the road after structure historical and historiographic studies metahistorical studies evolutionary philosophy of science conclusion references and further reading kuhn’s work secondary sources  early life and career kuhn was born in cincinnati ohio on  july  he was the first of two children born to samuel l and minette neè stroock kuhn with a brother roger born several years later his father was a native cincinnatian and his mother a native new yorker kuhn’s father sam was a hydraulic engineer trained at harvard university and at massachusetts institute of technology mit prior to world war i he entered the war and served in the army corps of engineers after leaving the armed services sam returned to cincinnati for several years before moving to new york to help his recently widowed mother setty neè swartz kuhn kuhn’s mother minette was a liberally educated person who came from an affluent family kuhn’s early education reflected the family’s liberal progressiveness in  kuhn began schooling at the progressive lincoln school in manhattan his early education taught him to think independently but by his own admission there was little content to the thinking he remembered that by the second grade for instance he was unable to read proficiently much to the consternation of his parents beginning in the sixth grade kuhn’s family moved to crotononhudson a small town about fifty miles from manhattan and the adolescent kuhn attended the progressive hessian hills school according to kuhn the school was staffed by leftoriented radical teachers who taught the students pacifism when he left the school after the ninth grade kuhn felt he was a bright and independent thinker after spending an uninspired year at the preparatory school solebury in pennsylvania kuhn spent his last two years of high school at the yalepreparatory taft school in watertown connecticut he graduated third in his class of  students and was inducted into the national honor society he also received the prestigious rensselaer alumni association medal kuhn matriculated to harvard college in the fall of  following his father’s and uncles’ footsteps at harvard he acquired a better sense of himself socially by participating in various organizations during his first year kuhn took a yearlong philosophy course in the first semester he studied plato and aristotle while in the second semester he studied descartes spinoza hume and kant he intended to take additional philosophy courses but could not find time he attended however several of george sarton’s lectures on the history of science but he found them boring at harvard kuhn agonized over majoring in either physics or mathematics after seeking his father’s counsel he chose physics because of career opportunities interestingly the attraction of physics or mathematics was their problemsolving traditions in the fall of his sophomore year the japanese attacked pearl harbor and kuhn expedited his undergraduate education by going to summer school the physics department focused on teaching predominantly electronics and kuhn followed suit kuhn underwent another radical transformation also during his sophomore year although he was trained a pacifist the atrocities perpetrated in europe during world war ii especially by hitler horrified him kuhn experienced a crisis since he was unable to defend pacifism reasonably the outcome was that he became an interventionist which was the position of many at harvard—especially its president conant the episode left a lasting impact upon him in a harvard crimson editorial kuhn supported conant’s effort to militarize the universities in the united states the editorial came to the attention of the administration and eventually conant and kuhn met in the spring of  kuhn graduated summa cum laude from harvard college with an sb after graduation he worked for the radio research laboratory located in harvard’s biology building he conducted research on radar counter technology under john van vleck’s supervision the job procured for kuhn a deferment from the draft after a year he requested a transfer to england and then to the continent where he worked in association with the us office of scientific research and development the trip was kuhn’s first abroad and he felt invigorated by the experience however kuhn realized that he did not like radar work which led him to reconsider whether he wanted to continue as a physicist but these doubts did not dampen his enthusiasm for or belief in science during this time kuhn had the opportunity to read what he wanted he read in the philosophy of science including authors such as bertrand russell pw bridgman rudolf carnap and philipp frank after ve day in  kuhn returned to harvard as the war abated with the dropping of atomic bombs on japan kuhn activated an earlier acceptance into graduate school and began studies in the physics department although kuhn persuaded the department to permit him to take philosophy courses during his first year he again chose the pragmatic course and focused on physics in  kuhn passed the general examinations and received a master’s degree in physics he then began dissertation research on theoretical solidstate physics under the direction of van vleck in  harvard awarded kuhn a doctorate in physics although kuhn had high regard for science especially physics he was unfulfilled as a physicist and continually harbored doubts during graduate school about a career in physics he had chosen both a dissertation topic and an advisor to expedite obtaining a degree but he was to find direction for his career through conant’s invitation in  to help prepare a historical casebased course on science for upperlevel undergraduates kuhn accepted the invitation to be one of two assistants for conant’s course he undertook a project investigating the origins of seventeenthcentury mechanics a project that would transform his image of science that transformation came as kuhn recounted later on a summer day in  as he struggled to understand aristotle’s idea of motion in physics the problem was that kuhn tried to make sense of aristotle’s idea of motion using newtonian assumptions and categories of motion once he realized that he had to read aristotle’s physics using assumptions and categories contemporary to when the greek philosopher wrote it suddenly aristotle’s idea of motion made sense after this experience kuhn realized that he wanted to be a philosopher of science by doing history of science his interest was not strictly history of science but philosophy for he felt that philosophy was the way to truth and truth was what he was after to achieve that goal kuhn asked conant to sponsor him as a junior fellow in the harvard society of fellows harvard initiated the society to provide promising young scholars freedom from teaching for three years to develop a scholarly program kuhn’s colleagues stimulated him professionally especially a senior fellow by the name of willard quine at the time quine was publishing his critique on the distinction between the analytic and the synthetic which kuhn found reassuring for his own thinking kuhn began as a fellow in the fall of  which provided him the opportunity to retool as a historian of science kuhn took advantage of the opportunity and read widely over the next year and a half in the humanities and sciences just prior to his appointment as a fellow kuhn was also undergoing psychoanalysis this experience allowed him to see other people’s perspectives and contributed to his approach for conducting historical research  the road to structure a the lowell lectures in  the trustee of the lowell institute ralph lowell invited kuhn to deliver the  lowell lectures in these lectures kuhn outlined a conception of science in contrast to the traditional philosophy of science’s conception in which facts are slowly accumulated and stockpiled in textbooks kuhn began by assuring his audience that he as a once practicing scientist believed that science produces useful and cumulative knowledge of the world but that traditional analysis of science distorts the process by which scientific knowledge develops he went on to inform the audience that the history of science could be instructive for identifying the process by which creative science advances rather than focusing on the finished product promulgated in textbooks because textbooks only state the immutable scientific laws and marshal forth the experimental evidence to support those laws they cover over the creative process that leads to the laws in the first place kuhn then presented an alternative historical approach to scientific methodology he claimed that the traditional position in which galileo rejected aristotle’s physics because of galileo’s experiments is a fallacy rather galileo rejected aristotelianism as an entire system in other words galileo’s evidence was necessary but not sufficient rather the aristotelian system was under evaluation which also included its logic next kuhn proposed an alternative image of science based on the new approach to the history of science he introduced the notion of conceptual frameworks and drew from psychology to defend the advancement of science though scientists’ predispositions these predispositions allow scientists to negotiate a professional world and to learn from their experiences moreover they are important in organizing the scientist’s professional world and scientists do not dispense with them easily change in them represents a foundational alteration in a professional world kuhn argued that although logic is important for deriving meaning and for managing and manipulating knowledge scientific language—as natural—outstrips such formalization he upended the tables on an important tool for the traditional analysis of science by revealing the limitations of logical analysis he showed that logic is necessary but insufficient for justifying scientific knowledge logic then cannot guarantee the traditional image of science as the progressive accumulation of scientific facts kuhn next examined logical analysis in terms of language and meaning his position was that language is a way of dissecting the professional world in which scientists operate but there is always ambiguity or overlap in the meaning of terms as that world is dissected certainly scientists attempt to increase the precision of their terms but not to the point that they can eliminate ambiguity kuhn concluded by distinguishing between creative and textbook science in the same year of the lowell lectures harvard appointed kuhn as an instructor and the following year as an assistant professor kuhn’s primary teaching duty was in the general education curriculum where he taught natural sciences  along with leonard nash he also taught courses in the history of science and it was during this time that kuhn developed a course on the history of cosmology kuhn utilized course preparation for scholarly writing projects for example he handed out draft chapters of the copernican revolution to his classes a part of kuhn’s motivation for developing a new image of science was the misconceptions of science held by the public he blamed its misconceptions on introductory courses that stressed the textbook image of science as a fixed body of facts after discussing this state of affairs with friends and conant kuhn provided students with a more accurate image of science the key to that image claimed kuhn was science’s history which displays the creative and dynamic nature of science b the copernican revolution in the copernican revolution kuhn claimed he had identified an important feature of the revolution which previous scholars had missed its plurality what kuhn meant by plurality was that scientists have philosophical and even religious commitments which are important for the justification of scientific knowledge this stance was anathema to traditional philosophers of science who believed that such commitments played little—if any—role in the justification of scientific knowledge and relegated them to the discovery process kuhn began reconstruction of the copernican revolution by establishing the genuine scientific character of ancient cosmological conceptual schemes especially the twosphere cosmology composed of an inner sphere for the earth and an outer sphere for the heavens for kuhn conceptual schemes exhibit three important features they are comprehensive in terms of scientific predictions there is no final proof for them and they are derived from other schemes finally to be successful conceptual schemes must perform logical and psychological functions the logical function is expressed in explanatory terms while the psychological function in existential terms although the logical function of the twosphere cosmology continued to be problematic its psychological function afforded adherents a comprehensive worldview that included even religious elements the major logical problem with the twosphere cosmology was the movement and positions of the planets the conceptual scheme ptolemy developed in the second century guided research for the next millennium but problems surfaced with the scheme and predecessors could only correct it so far with ad hoc modifications kuhn asked at this point in the narrative why the ptolemaic system given its imperfection was not overthrown sooner the answer for kuhn depended on a distinction between the logical and psychological dimensions of scientific revolutions according to kuhn there are logically different conceptual schemes that can organize and account for observations the difference among these schemes is their predictive power consequently if an observation is made that is not compatible with a prediction the scheme must be replaced but before change can occur there is also the psychological dimension to a revolution copernicus had to overcome not only the logical dimension of the ptolemaic system but also its psychological dimension aristotle had established this latter dimension by wedding the twosphere cosmology to a philosophical system through the aristotelian notion of motion among the earthly and heavenly spheres the inner sphere was connected and depended on the outer sphere the ability to presage future events linked astronomy to astrology such an alliance according to kuhn provided a formidable obstacle to change of any kind but change began to take place albeit slowly from aristotle to ptolemy a sharp distinction arose between the psychological dimensions of cosmology and the mathematical precision of astronomy by ptolemy’s time astronomy was less concerned with the psychological dimensions of data interpretation and more with the accuracy of theoretical prediction to some extent this aided copernicus since whether the earth moved could be determined by theoretical analysis of the empirical data but still the earth as center of the universe gave existential consolation to people the strands of the copernican revolution then included not only astronomical concerns but also theological economic and social ones besides the scholastic tradition with its impetus theory of motion other factors also paved the way for the copernican revolution including the protestant revolution navigation for oceanic voyages calendar reform and renaissance humanism and neoplatonism copernicus according to kuhn was the immediate inheritor of aristotelianptolemaic cosmological tradition and except for the position of the earth was closer to that tradition than to modern astronomy for kuhn de revolutionibus precipitated a revolution and was not the revolution itself although the problem copernicus addressed was the same as for his predecessors that is planetary motion his solution was to revise the mathematical model for that motion by making the earth a planet that moves around the sun essentially copernicus maintained the aristotelianptolemaic universe but exchanged the sun for the earth as the universe’s center although copernicus had eliminated major epicycles he still used minor ones and the accuracy of planetary position was no better than ptolemy’s kuhn concluded that copernicus did not really solve the problem of planetary motion initially according to kuhn there were only a few supporters of copernicus’ cosmology although the majority of astronomers accepted the mathematical harmonies of de revolutionibus after its publication in  they rejected or ignored its cosmology tycho brahe for example although relying on copernican harmonies to explain astronomical data proposed a system in which the earth was still the universe’s center essentially it was a compromise between ancient cosmology and copernican mathematical astronomy however brahe recorded accurate and precise astronomical observations which helped to compel others towards copernicanism—particularly johannes kepler who used its mathematical precision to solve the planetary motion problem the final player kuhn considered in the revolution was galileo who kuhn claimed provided through telescopic observations not proof of but rather propaganda for copernicanism although astronomers achieved consensus during the seventeenth century copernicanism still faced serious resistance from christianity the copernican revolution was completed with the newtonian universe which not only had an impact on astronomy but also on other sciences and even nonsciences for instance newton’s universe changed the nature of god to that of a clockmaker for kuhn newtonian’s impact on disciplines other than astronomy was an example of its fruitfulness scientific progress concluded kuhn is not the linear process as championed by traditional philosophers of science in which scientific facts are stockpiled in a warehouse rather it is the repeated destruction and replacement of scientific theories the professional reviews of the copernican revolution signaled kuhn’s acceptance into the philosophical and historical communities his reconstruction of the revolution was considered for the most part scientifically accurate and methodologically appropriate reviewers considered integration of the science and the social an advance over other histories that ignored these dimensions of the historical narrative although philosophers appreciated the historical dimension of kuhn’s study they found its analysis imprecise according to their standards overall both the historical and philosophical communities expressed no major objections to the image of science that animated kuhn’s narrative kuhn’s reconstruction of the copernican revolution portrayed a radically different image of science than that of traditional philosophers of science justification of scientific knowledge was not simply a logical or objective affair but also included nonlogical or subjective factors according to kuhn scientific progress is not a clearsighted linear process aimed directly at the truth rather there are contingencies that can divert and forestall the progress of science moreover copernicus’ revolution changed the way astronomers and nonastronomers viewed the world this change in perceiving the world was the result of new sets of challenges new techniques and a new hermeneutics for interpreting data besides differing from traditional philosophers of science kuhn’s image of science put him at odds with whig historians of science these historians underrated ancient cosmologies by degrading them to myth or religious belief such a move was often a rhetorical ploy on the part of the victors to enhance the status of the current scientific theory only by showing how aristotelianptolemaic geocentric astronomy was authentic science could kuhn argue for the radical transformation revolution that copernican heliocentric astronomy invoked kuhn also asserted that copernicus’ theory was not accepted simply for its predictive ability since it was not as accurate as the original conceptual scheme but because of nonempirical factors such as the simplicity of copernican’s system in which certain ad hoc modifications for accounting for the orbits of various planets were eliminated in  harvard denied kuhn tenure because the tenure committee felt his book on the copernican revolution was too popular in its approach and analysis a friend of kuhn knew steven pepper who was chair of the philosophy department at the university of california at berkeley kuhn’s friend told pepper that kuhn was looking for an academic position pepper’s department was searching for someone to establish a program in the history and philosophy of science berkeley eventually offered kuhn a position in the philosophy department and later asked if he also wanted an appointment in the history department kuhn accepted both positions and joined the berkeley faculty as an assistant professor kuhn found stanley cavell in the philosophy department a soulmate to replace nash kuhn had meet cavell earlier while they were both fellows at harvard cavell was an ethicist and aesthetician whom kuhn found intellectually stimulating he introduced kuhn to wittgenstein’s notion of language games besides cavell kuhn developed a professional relationship with paul feyerabend who was also working on the notion of incommensurability in  berkeley promoted kuhn to associate professor and granted him tenure moreover having completed several historical projects he was ready to return to the philosophical issues that first attracted him to the history of science beginning in the fall of  he spent a year as a fellow at the center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences at stanford california what struck kuhn about the relationships among behavioral and social scientists was their inability to agree on the fundamental problems and practices of their discipline although natural scientists do not necessarily have the right answers to their questions there is an agreement over fundamentals this difference between natural and social scientists eventually led kuhn to formulate the paradigm concept c the last mile to structure although the copernican revolution represented a significant advance in kuhn’s articulation of a revolutionary theory of science several issues still needed attention what was missing from kuhn’s reconstruction of the copernican revolution was an understanding of how scientists function on a daily basis when an impending revolution is not looming that understanding emerged gradually during the last mile on the road to structure in terms of three papers written from the midfifties to the early sixties in the first paper ‘the function of measurement in modern physical science’ kuhn challenged the belief that if scientists cannot measure a phenomenon then their knowledge of it is inadequate or not scientific part of the reason for kuhn’s concern over measurement in science was its textbook tradition which he believed perpetuates a myth about measurement that is misleading kuhn compared the textbook presentation of measurement to a machine in which scientists feed laws and theories along with initial conditions into the machine’s hopper at the top turn a handle on the side representing logical and mathematical operations and then collect numerical predictions exiting the machine’s chute in the front scientists finally compare experimental observations to theoretical predictions the function of these measurements serves as a test of the theory which is the confirmation function of measurement kuhn claimed that the above function is not why measurements are reported in textbooks rather measurements are reported to give the reader an idea of what the professional community believes is reasonable agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental observations reasonable agreement however depends upon approximate not exact agreement between theory and data and differs from one science to the next moreover external criteria do not exist for determining reasonableness for kuhn the actual function of normal measurement in science is found in its journal articles that function is neither invention of novel theories nor the confirmation of older ones discovery and exploratory measurements in science instead are rare the reason is that changes in theories which require discovery or confirmation occur during revolutions which are also quite rare once a revolution occurs moreover the new theory only exhibits potential for ordering and explaining natural phenomena the function of normal measurement is to tighten reasonable agreement between novel theoretical predictions and experimental observations the textbook tradition is also misleading in terms of normal measurement’s effects it claims that theories must conform to quantitative facts such facts are not the given but the expected and the scientist’s task is to obtain them this obligation to obtain the expected quantitative fact is often the incentive for developing novel technology moreover a welldeveloped theoretical system is required for meaningful measurement in science besides the function of normal or expected measurement kuhn also examined the function of extraordinary measurement—which pertain to unexpected results it is this latter type of measurement that exhibits the discovery and confirmatory functions when normal scientific practice results consistently in unexpected anomalies this leads to crisis and extraordinary measurement often aids to resolve it crisis then leads to the invention of new theories again extraordinary measurement plays a critical role in this process theory invention in response to quantitative anomalies leads to decisive measurements for judging a novel theory’s adequacy whereas qualitative anomalies generally lead to ad hoc modifications of theories extraordinary measurement allows scientists to choose among competing theories kuhn was moving closer towards a notion of normal science through an analysis of normal measurement in contrast to extraordinary measurement in science his conception of science continued to distance him from traditional philosophers of science but the notion of normal measurement was not as robust as he needed importantly kuhn was changing the agenda for philosophy of science from justification of scientific theories as finished products in textbooks to dynamic process by which theories are tested and assimilated into the professional literature a robust notion of normal science was the revolutionary concept he needed to overturn the traditional image of science as an accumulated body of facts with the introduction of normal and extraordinary measurement the step towards the notions of normal and extraordinary science in kuhn’s revolutionary image of science was imminent kuhn worked out those notions in the essential tension he began by addressing the notion that creative thinking in science assumes a particular assumption of science in which science advances through unbridled imagination and divergent thinking—which involves identifying multiple avenues by which to solve a problem and determining which one works best kuhn acknowledged that such thinking is responsible for some scientific progress but he proposed that convergent thinking—which limits itself to welldefined often logical steps for solving a problem—is also an important means of progress while revolutions which depend on divergent thinking are an obvious means for scientific progress kuhn insisted that few scientists consciously design revolutionary experiments rather most scientists engage in normal research which represents convergent thinking but occasionally scientists may break with the tradition of normal science and replace it with a new tradition science as a profession is both traditional and iconoclastic and the tension between them often creates a space in which to practice it next kuhn utilized the term paradigm while discussing the pedagogical advantages of convergent thinking—especially as displayed in science textbooks whereas textbooks in other disciplines include the methodological and conceptual conflicts prevalent within the discipline science textbooks do not rather science education is the transmission of a tradition that guides the activities of practitioners in science education students are taught not to evaluate the tradition but to accept it progress within normal research projects represents attempts to bring theory and observation into closer agreement and to extend a theory’s scope to new phenomena given the convergent and traditionbound nature of science education and of scientific practice how can normal research be a means for the generation of revolutionary knowledge and technology according to kuhn a mature science provides the background that allows practitioners to identify nontrivial problems or anomalies with a paradigm in other words without mature science there can be no revolution kuhn continued to develop the notion of normal research and its convergent thinking in ‘the function of dogma in scientific research’ he began with the traditional image of science as an objective and critical enterprise although this is the ideal the reality is that often scientists already know what to expect from their investigations of natural phenomena if the expected is not forthcoming then scientists must struggle to find conformity between what they expect and what they observe which textbooks encode as dogmas dogmas are critical for the practice of normal science and for advancement in it because they define the puzzles for the profession and stipulate the criteria for their solution kuhn next expanded the range of paradigms to embrace scientific practice in general rather than simply as a model for research specifically paradigms include not only a community’s previous scientific achievements but also its theoretical concepts the experimental techniques and protocols and even the natural entities in short they are the community’s body of beliefs or foundations paradigms are also openended in terms of solving problems moreover they are exclusive in their nature in that there is only one paradigm per mature science finally they are not permanent fixtures of the scientific landscape for eventually paradigms are replaceable importantly for kuhn when a paradigm replaces another the two paradigms are radically different having done paradigmatic spadework kuhn then discussed the notion of normal scientific research the process of matching paradigm and nature includes extending and applying the paradigm to expected but also unexpected parts of nature this does not necessarily mean discovering the unknown as it does explaining the known although the dogma paper is only a fragment of the solution to problems associated with the traditional image of science the complete solution was soon to appear in structure  the structure of scientific revolutions in july  kuhn completed a draft of structure and in  it was published as the final monograph in the second volume of neurath’s international encyclopedia of unified science charles morris was instrumental in its publication and carnap served as its editor structure was not a single publishing event in  rather it covered the years from  to  after its publication kuhn was engrossed for the rest of the sixties addressing criticisms directed to the ideas contained in it especially the paradigm concept during this time he continued to develop and refine his new image of science the endpoint was a second edition of structure that appeared in  the text of the revised edition however remained essentially unaltered and only a ‘postscript—’ was added in which kuhn addressed his critics what kuhn proposed in structure was a new image of science that image differed radically from the traditional one the difference hinged on a shift from a logical analysis and an explanation of scientific knowledge as finished product to a historical narration and description of scientific practices by which a community of practitioners produces scientific knowledge in short it was a shift from the subject the product to the verb to produce according to the traditional image science is a repository of accumulated facts discovered by individuals at specific periods in history one of the central tasks of traditional historians given this image of science was to answer questions about who discovered what and when even though the task seemed straightforward many historians found it difficult and doubted whether these were the right kinds of questions to ask concerning science’s historical record the historiographic revolution in the study of science changed the sorts of questions historians asked by revising the underlying assumptions concerning the approach to reading the historical record rather than reading history backwards and imposing current ideas and values on the past texts are read within their historical context thereby maintaining their integrity the historiographic revolution also had implications for how to analyze and understand science philosophically the goal of structure declared kuhn was to cash out those implications the structure of scientific development according to kuhn may be illustrated schematically as follows preparadigm science → normal science → extraordinary science → new normal science the step from preparadigm science to normal science involves consensus of the community around a single paradigm where no prior consensus existed this is the step required for transitioning from immature to mature science the step from normal science to extraordinary science includes the community’s recognition that the reigning paradigm is unable to account for accumulating anomalies a crisis ensues and community practitioners engage in extraordinary science to resolve its anomalies a scientific revolution occurs with crisis resolution once a community selects a new paradigm it discards the old one and another period of new normal science follows the revolution or paradigm shift is now complete and the cycle from normal science to new normal science through revolution is free to occur again for kuhn the origin of a scientific discipline begins with the identification of a natural phenomenon which members of the discipline investigate experimentally and attempt to explain theoretically but each member of that nascent discipline is at crosspurposes with other members for each member often represents a school working from different foundations scientists operating under these conditions share few if any theoretical concepts experimental techniques or phenomenal entities rather each school is in competition for monetary and social resources and for the allegiance of the professional guild an outcome of this lack of consensus is that all facts seem equally relevant to the problems at hand and fact gathering itself is often a random activity there is then a proliferation of facts and hence little progress in solving the problems under these conditions kuhn called this state preparadigm or immature science which is nondirected and flexible providing a community of practitioners little guidance to achieve the status of a science a discipline must reach consensus with respect to a single paradigm this is realized when during the competition involved in preparadigm science one school makes a stunning achievement that catches the professional community’s attention the candidate paradigm elicits the community’s confidence that the problems are solvable with precision and in detail the community’s confidence in a paradigm to guide research is the basis for the conversion of its members who now commit to it after paradigm consensus kuhn claimed that scientists are in the position to commence with the practice of normal science the prerequisite of normal science then includes a commitment to a shared paradigm that defines the rules and standards by which to practice science whereas preparadigm science is nondirected and flexible normal or paradigm science is highly directed and rigid because of its directedness and rigidity normal scientists are able to make the progress they do the paradigm concept loomed large in kuhn’s new image of science he defined the concept in terms of the community’s concrete achievements such as newtonian mechanics which the professional can commonly recognize but cannot fully describe or explain a paradigm is certainly not just a set of rules or algorithms by which scientists blindly practice their trade in fact there is no easy way to abstract a paradigm’s essence or to define its features exhaustively moreover a paradigm defines a family resemblance à la wittgenstein of problems and procedures for solving problems that are part of a single research tradition although scientists rely at times on rules to guide research these rules do not precede paradigms importantly kuhn was not claiming that rules are unnecessary for guiding research but rather that they are not always sufficient either pedagogically or professionally kuhn compared the paradigm concept to polanyi’s notion of tacit knowledge in which knowledge production depends on the investigator’s acquisition of skills that do not reduce to methodological rules and protocols as noted above newtonian mechanics represents an example of a kuhnian paradigm the three laws of motion comprising it provided the scientific community with the resources to investigate natural phenomena in terms of both precision and predictability in terms of precision newtonian mechanics allowed physicists to measure and explain accurately—with clockwork exactitude—the motion not only of celestial but also terrestrial bodies with respect to prediction physicists used the newtonian paradigm to determine the potential movement of heavenly and earthly bodies thus newtonian mechanics qua paradigm equipped physicists with the ability to explain and manipulate natural phenomena in sum it became a way of viewing the world according to kuhn a paradigm allows scientists to ignore concerns over a discipline’s fundamentals and to concentrate on solving its puzzles—as the newtonian paradigm permitted physicists to do for several centuries it not only guides scientists in terms of identifying soluble puzzles but it also prevents scientists from tackling insoluble ones kuhn compared paradigms to maps that guide and direct the community’s investigations only when a paradigm guides the community’s activities is scientific advancement as cumulative progress possible the activity of practitioners engaged in normal science is paradigm articulation and extension to new areas indeed the newtonian paradigm was adapted even for medicine when a new paradigm is established it solves only a few critical problems that faced the community but it does offer the promise for solving many more problems much of normal science involves mopping up in which the community forces nature into a conceptually rigid framework—the paradigm rather than being dull and routine however such activity according to kuhn is exciting and rewarding and requires practitioners who are creative and resourceful normal scientists are not out to make new discoveries or to invent new theories outside the paradigm’s aegis rather they are involved in using the paradigm to understand nature precisely and in detail from the experimental end of this task normal scientists go to great pains to increase the precision and reliability of their measurements and facts they are also involved in closing the gap between observations and theoretical predictions and they attempt to clarify ambiguities left over from the paradigm’s initial adoption they also strive to extend the scope of the paradigm by including phenomena not heretofore investigated much of this activity requires exploratory investigation in which normal scientists make novel discoveries but anticipated visàvis the paradigm to solve these experimental puzzles often requires considerable technological ingenuity and innovation on the part of the scientific community as kuhn notes atwood’s machine—developed almost a century after newton is a good illustration of this besides experimental puzzles there are also the theoretical puzzles of normal science which obviously mirror the types of experimental puzzles normal scientists conduct theoretical analyses to enhance the match between theoretical predictions and experimental observations especially in terms of increasing the paradigm’s precision and scope again just as experimental ingenuity is required so is theoretical ingenuity to explain natural phenomena successfully normal science according to kuhn is puzzlesolving activity and its practitioners are puzzle solvers and not paradigm testers the paradigm’s power over a community of practitioners is that it can transform seemingly insoluble problems into soluble ones through the practitioner’s ingenuity and skill besides the assured solution kuhn’s paradigm concept also involved rules of the puzzlesolving game not in a narrow sense of algorithms but in a broad sense of viewpoints or preconceptions besides these rules of the game as it were there are also metaphysical commitments which inform the community as to the types of natural entities and methodological commitments which inform the community as to kinds of laws and explanations although rules are often necessary for normal scientific research they are not always required normal science can proceed in the absence of such rules although scientists engaged in normal science do not intentionally attempt to make unexpected discoveries such discoveries do occur paradigms are imperfect and rifts in the match between paradigm and nature are inevitable for kuhn discoveries not only occur in terms of new facts but there is also invention in terms of novel theories both discoveries of new facts and invention of novel theories begin with anomalies which are violations of paradigm expectations during the practice of normal science anomalies can lead to unexpected discoveries for kuhn unexpected discoveries involve complex processes that include the intertwining of both new facts and novel theories facts and theories go handinhand for such discoveries cannot be made by simple inspection because discoveries depend upon the intertwining of observations and theories the discovery process takes time for the conceptual integration of the novel with the known moreover that process is complicated by the fact that novelties are often resisted due to prior expectations because of allegiance to a paradigm scientists are loathed to abandon it simply because of an anomaly or even several anomalies in other words anomalies are generally not counterinstances that falsify a paradigm just as anomalies are critical for discovery of new facts or phenomena so they are essential for the invention of novel theories although facts and theories are intertwined the emergence of novel theories is the outcome of a crisis the crisis is the result of the paradigm’s breakdown or inability to provide solutions to its anomalies the community then begins to harbor questions about the ability of the paradigm to guide research which has a profound impact upon it the chief characteristic of a crisis is the proliferation of theories as members of a community in crisis attempt to resolve its anomalies they offer more and varied theories interestingly anomalies that are responsible for the crisis may not necessarily be new since they may have been present all along this helps to explain why anomalies lead to a period of crisis in the first place the paradigm promised resolution of them but was unable to fulfill its promise the overall effect is a return to a situation very similar to preparadigm science closure of a crisis occurs in one of three possible ways according to kuhn first on occasion that the paradigm is sufficiently robust to resolve anomalies and to restore normal science practice second even the most radical methods are unable to revolve the anomalies under these circumstances the community tables them until future investigation and analysis third the crisis is resolved with the replacement of the old paradigm by a new one but only after a period of extraordinary science kuhn stressed that the initial response of a community in crisis is not to abandon its paradigm rather its members make every effort to salvage it through ad hoc modifications until the anomalies can be resolved either theoretically or experimentally the reason for this strong allegiance claimed kuhn is that a community must first have an alternative candidate to take the original paradigm’s place for science at least normal science is possible only with a paradigm and to reject it without a substitute is to reject science itself which reflects poorly on the community and not on the paradigm moreover a community does not reject a paradigm simply because of a fissure in the paradigmnature fit kuhn’s aim was to reject a naïve popperian falsificationism in which single counterinstances are sufficient to reject a theory in fact he reversed the tables and contended that counterinstances are essential for the practice of vibrant normal science although the goal of normal science is not necessarily to generate counterinstances normal science practice does provide the occasion for their possible occurrence normal science then serves as an opportunity for scientific revolutions if there are no counterinstances reasoned kuhn scientific development comes to a halt the transition from normal science through crisis to extraordinary science involves two key events first the paradigm’s boundaries become blurred when faced with recalcitrant anomalies and second its rules are relaxed leading to proliferation of theories and ultimately to the emergence of a new paradigm often relaxing the rules allows practitioners to see exactly where the problem is and how to solve it this state has tremendous impact upon a community’s practitioners similar to that during preparadigm science extraordinary scientists according to kuhn behave erratically—because scientists are trained under a paradigm to be puzzlesolvers not paradigmtesters in other words they are not trained to do extraordinary science and must learn as they go for kuhn this type of behavior is more open to psychological than logical analysis moreover during periods of extraordinary science practitioners may even examine the discipline’s philosophical foundations to that end they analyze their assumptions in order to loosen the old paradigm’s grip on the community and to suggest alternative approaches to the generation of a new paradigm although the process of extraordinary science is convoluted and complex a replacement paradigm may emerge suddenly often the source of its inspiration is rooted in the practice of extraordinary science itself in terms of the interconnections among various anomalies finally whereas normal science is a cumulative process adding one paradigm achievement to the next extraordinary science is not rather it is like—using herbert butterfield’s analogy—grabbing hold of a stick’s other end that other end of the stick is a scientific revolution the transition from extraordinary science to a new normal science represents a scientific revolution according to kuhn a scientific revolution is noncumulative in which a newer paradigm replaces an older one—either partially or completely it can come in two sizes a major revolution such as the shift from geocentric universe to heliocentric universe or a minor revolution such as the discovery of xrays or oxygen but whether big or small all revolutions have the same structure generation of a crisis through irresolvable anomalies and establishment of a new paradigm that resolves the crisisproducing anomalies because of the extreme positions taken by participants in a revolution opposing camps often become galvanized in their positions and communication between them breaks down and discourse fails the ultimate source for the establishment of a new paradigm during a crisis is community consensus that is when enough community members are convinced by persuasion and not simply by empirical evidence or logical analysis moreover to accept the new paradigm community practitioners must be assured that there is no chance for the old paradigm to solve its anomalies persuasion loomed large in kuhn’s scientific revolutions because the new paradigm solves the anomalies the old paradigm could not thus the two paradigms are radically different from each other often with little overlap between them for kuhn a community can only accept the new paradigm if it considers the old one wrong the radical difference between old and new paradigms such that the old cannot be derived from the new is the basis of the incommensurability thesis in essence there is no common measure or standard for the two paradigms this is evident claimed kuhn when looking at the meaning of theoretical terms although the terms from an older paradigm can be compared to those of a newer one the older terms must be transformed with respect to the newer ones but there is a serious problem with restating the old paradigm in transformed terms the older transformed paradigm may have some utility for example pedagogically but a community cannot use it to guide its research like a fossil it reminds the community of its history but it can no longer direct its future the establishment of a new paradigm resolves a scientific revolution and issues forth a new period of normal science with its establishment kuhn’s new image of a mature science comes full circle only after a period on intense competition among rival paradigms does the community choose a new paradigm and scientists once again become puzzlesolvers rather than paradigmtesters the resolution of a scientific revolution is not a straightforward process that depends only upon reason or evidence part of the problem is that proponents of competing paradigms cannot agree on the relevant evidence or proof or even on the relevant anomalies that require resolution since their paradigms are incommensurable another factor that leads to difficulties in resolving scientific revolutions is that communication among members in crisis is only partial this results from the new paradigm borrowing from the old paradigm theoretical terms and concepts and laboratory protocols although they share borrowed vocabulary and technology the new paradigm gives new meaning and uses to them the net result is that members of competing paradigms talk past one another moreover the change in paradigms is not a gradual process in which different parts of the paradigm are changed piecemeal rather the change must be as a whole and suddenly convincing scientists to make such a wholesale transformation takes time how then does one segment of the community convince or persuade another to switch paradigms for members who worked for decades under the old paradigm they may never accept the new paradigm rather it is often the younger members who accept the new paradigm through something like a religious conversion according to kuhn faith is the basis for conversion especially faith in the potential of the new paradigm to solve future puzzles by invoking the terms conversion and faith kuhn was not implying that arguments and reason are unimportant in a paradigm shift indeed the most common reason for accepting a new paradigm is that it solves the anomalies the old paradigm could not however kuhn point was that argument and reason alone are insufficient aesthetic or subjective factors also play an important role in a paradigm shift since the new paradigm solves only a few but critical anomalies these factors weigh heavily in the shift initially by reassuring community members that the new paradigm represents the discipline’s future from the resolution of revolutions kuhn made several important philosophical points concerning the principles of verification and falsification as kuhn acknowledged philosophers no longer search for absolute verification since no theory can be tested exhaustively rather they calculate the probability of a theory’s verification according to probabilistic verification every imaginable theory must be compared with one another visàvis the available data the problem in terms of kuhn’s new image of science is that a theory is tested with respect to a given paradigm and such a restriction precludes access to every imaginable theory moreover kuhn rejected falsifying instances because no paradigm resolves every problem facing a community under these conditions no paradigm would ever be accepted for kuhn the process of verification and falsification must include imprecision associated with theoryfact fit an interesting feature of scientific revolutions according to kuhn is their invisibility what he meant by this is that in the process of writing textbooks popular scientific essays and even philosophy of science the path to the current paradigm is sanitized to make it appear as if it was in some sense born mature disguising a paradigm’s history is an outcome of a belief about scientific knowledge which considers it as invariable and its accumulation as linear this disguising serves the winner of the crisis by establishing its authority especially as a pedagogical aid for indoctrinating students into a community of practitioners another important effect of a revolution related to a paradigm shift is a shift in the community’s image of science the change in science’s image should be no surprise since the prevailing paradigm defines science change that paradigm and science itself changes at least how to practice it in other words the shift in science’s image is a result of a change in the community’s standards for what constitutes its puzzles and its puzzles’ solutions finally revolutions transform scientists from practitioners of normal science who are puzzlesolvers to practitioners of extraordinary science who are paradigmtesters besides transforming science revolutions also transform the world that scientists inhabit and investigate one of the major impacts of a scientific revolution is a change of the world in which scientists practice their trade kuhn’s worldchanges thesis as it has become known is certainly one of his most radical and controversial ideas besides the associated incommensurability thesis the issue is how far ontologically does the change go or is it simply an epistemological ploy to reinforce the comprehensive effects of scientific revolutions in other words does the world really change or simply the worldview that is one’s perspective on or perception of the world for kuhn the answer relied not on a logical or even a philosophical but rather a psychological analysis of the change kuhn analyzed the changes in worldview by analogizing it to a gestalt switch for example duckrabbit although the gestalt analogy is suggestive it is limited to only perceptual changes and says little about the role of previous experience in such transformations previous experience is important because it influences what a scientist sees when making an observation moreover with a gestalt switch the person can stand above or outside of it acknowledging with certainty that one sees now a duck or now a rabbit such an independent perspective which eventually is an authoritarian stance is not available to the community of practitioners there is no answer sheet as it were because the community’s access to the world is limited by what it can observe any change in what is observed has important consequences for the nature of what is observed that is the change has ontological significance thus for kuhn the change revolution brings about is more than simply seeing or observing a different world it also involves working in a different world the perceptual transformation is more than reinterpretation of data for data are not stable but they too change during a paradigm shift data interpretation is a function of normal science while data transformation is a function of extraordinary science that transformation is often a result of intuitions moreover besides a change in data revolutions change the relationships among data although traditional western philosophy has searched for three centuries for stable theoryneutral data or observations to justify theories that search has been in vain sensory experience occurs through a paradigm of some sort argued kuhn even articulations of that experience hence no one can step outside a paradigm to make an observation it is simply impossible given the limits of human physiology kuhn then took on the nature of scientific progress for normal science progress is cumulative in that the solutions to puzzles form a repository of information and knowledge about the world this progress is the result of the direction a paradigm provides a community of practitioners importantly the progress achieved through normal science in terms of the information and knowledge is used to educate the next generation of scientists and to manipulate the world for human welfare scientific revolutions change all that for kuhn revolutionary progress is not cumulative but noncumulative what then does a community of practitioners gain by going through a revolution or paradigm shift has it made any kind of progress in its rejection of a previous paradigm and the fruit that paradigm yielded of course the victors of the revolution are going to claim that progress was made after the revolution to do otherwise would be to admit that they were wrong rather advocates of the new normal science are going to do everything they can to ensure that their winning paradigm is seen as pushing forward a better understanding of the world the progress achieved through a revolution is twofold according to kuhn the first is the successful solution of anomalies that a previous paradigm could not solve the second is the promise to solve additional problems or puzzles that arise from these anomalies but has the community gotten closer to the truth that is the notion of verisimilitude by going through a revolution according to kuhn the answer is no for kuhn progress in science is not directed activity towards some goal like truth rather scientific progress is evolutionary just as natural selection operates during biological evolution in the emergence of a new species so community selection during a scientific revolution functions similarly in the emergence of a new theory and just as species are adapted to their environments so theories are adapted to the world kuhn had no answer to the question why this should be other than the world and the community that investigates it exhibit unique features what these features are kuhn did not know but he concluded that the new image of science he had proposed would resolve like a new paradigm after a scientific revolution these problems he invited the next generation of philosophers of science to join him in a new philosophy of science incommensurate with its predecessor the reaction to kuhn’s structure was at first congenial especially by historians of science but within a few years it turned critical particularly by philosophers critics charged him with irrationalism and epistemic relativism although he felt the reviews of structure were good his chief concerns were the tags of irrationalism and relativism—at least a pernicious kind of relativism kuhn believed the charges were inaccurate however simply because he maintained that science does not progress toward a predetermined goal but like evolutionary change one theory replaces another with a better fit between theory and nature visàvis competitors moreover he believed that use of the darwinian evolution was the correct framework for discussing science’s progress but he felt no one took it seriously on  july  kuhn participated in an international colloquium in the philosophy of science held at bedford college in london the colloquium was organized jointly by the british society for the philosophy of science and by the london school of economics and political science kuhn delivered the initial paper comparing his and karl popper’s conceptions of the growth of scientific knowledge john watkins then delivered a paper criticizing kuhn’s notion of normal science with popper chairing the session popper also presented a paper criticizing kuhn as did several other members of the philosophy of science community including stephen toulmin l pearce williams and margaret masterman who identified twentyone senses of kuhn’s use of paradigm in structure masterman concluded her paper inviting others to join in clarifying kuhn’s paradigm concept kuhn himself took up masterman’s challenge and clarified the paradigm concept in the second edition of structure particularly in its ‘postscript—’ to that end he divided paradigm into disciplinary matrix and exemplars the former represents the milieu of the professional practice consisting of symbolic generalizations models and values while the latter represents solutions to concrete problems that a community accepts as paradigmatic in other words exemplars serve as templates for solving problems or puzzles facing the scientific community and thereby for advancing the community’s scientific knowledge for kuhn scientific knowledge is not localized simply within theories and rules rather it is localized within exemplars the basis for an exemplar to function in puzzle solving is the scientist’s ability to see the similarity between a previously solved puzzle and a currently unsolved one in the early sixties van vleck invited kuhn to direct a project collecting materials on the history of quantum mechanics in august  hunter dupree charles kittel kuhn john wheeler and harry wolff met in berkeley to discuss the project’s organization wheeler next met with richard shryock and a joint committee of the american physical society and the american philosophical society on the history of theoretical physics in the twentieth century was formed to sponsor and develop the project the project lasted for three years with the first and last years of the project conducted in berkeley and the middle year in europe the national science foundation funded the project the project led to a publication by john heilbron and kuhn on the origins of the bohr atom they provided a revisionist narrative of bohr’s path to the quantized atom beginning with his  doctoral dissertation and concluding with his  threepart paper on atomic structure the intrigue of this historical study was that within a sixweek period in mid bohr went from little interest in models of the atom to producing a quantized model of jj rutherford’s atom and applying that model to several perplexing problems the authors explored bohr’s sudden interest in atomic models they proposed that his interest stemmed from specific problems which guided bohr in terms of both his reading and research toward the potential of the atomic structure for solving them the solutions to those problems resulted from what heilbron and kuhn called a  february transformation in bohr’s research what initiated the transformation claimed the authors was that bohr had read a few months earlier jw nicholson’s papers on the application of max planck’s constant to generate an atomic model although nicholson’s model was incorrect it led bohr in the right direction then in february  bohr in a conversation with hr hansen obtained the last piece of the puzzle after the transformation bohr completed the atomic model project within the year besides completing a draft of structure in  kuhn was made full professor at berkeley but only in the history department members of philosophy department voted to deny him promotion in their department a denial that angered and hurt kuhn tremendously princeton university made kuhn an offer to join its faculty while he was in europe the university had recently inaugurated a history and philosophy of science program the program’s chair was charles gillispie and its staff included john murdoch hilary putnam and carl hempel upon returning to the united states in  kuhn visited princeton he decided to accept the offer and joined its faculty in  he became the program’s director in  and the following year princeton appointed him the moses taylor pyne professor of history as the sixties ended structure was becoming increasingly popular especially among student radicals who believed it liberated them from the tyranny of tradition  the road after structure in  kuhn moved to mit’s department of linguistics and philosophy in  he was appointed the laurance s rockefeller professor of philosophy at mit he took a linguistic turn in his thinking reflecting his new environment which had a major impact on his subsequent work especially on the incommensurability thesis structure’s success not only established the historiographic revolution in the study of science in either historically or philosophically or what came to be called the discipline of history and philosophy of science but also supported the rise of science studies in general and specifically the sociology and anthropology of science particularly the sociology of scientific knowledge kuhn rejected both these trajectories often attributed to structure for what he called historical philosophy of science he conducted—as he categorized his work in the essential tension—either historical studies on science or their historiographic implications or either metahistorical studies or their philosophical implications in other words his scholarly work was either historical or philosophical a historical and historiographic studies kuhn’s final major historical study was on planck’s blackbody radiation theory and the origins of quantum discontinuity the transition from classical physics—in which particles pass through intermediate energy stages—to quantum physics—in which energy change is discontinuous—is traditionally attributed to planck’s  and  quantum papers according to kuhn this traditional account was inaccurate and the transition was initiated by albert einstein’s and paul ehrenfest’s independent  quantum papers kuhn’s realization of this inaccuracy was similar to the enlightenment he experienced when struggling to make sense of aristotle’s notion of mechanical motion his initial epiphany occurred while reading planck’s  paper on blackbody radiation through that experience he realized that planck’s  and  quantum papers were not the initiation of a new theory of quantum discontinuity but rather they represented planck’s effort to derive the blackbody distribution law based on classical statistical mechanics kuhn concluded the study with an analysis of planck’s second blackbody theory first published in  in which planck used the notion of discontinuity to derive the second theory rather than the traditional position which claimed the second theory represents a regression on planck’s part to classical physics kuhn argued that it represents the first time planck incorporated into his theoretical work a theory in which he was not completely confident in the blackbody radiation and quantum discontinuity historical study kuhn did not use paradigm normal science anomaly crisis or incommensurability which he championed in structure critics especially within the history and philosophy of science discipline were disappointed kuhn bemoaned the book’s reception even by its supporters however he later explored the historiographic and philosophical issues raised in blackbody theory with respect to structure the historiographic issues that the former book addressed were the same raised in the  monograph specifically he claimed that current historiography should attempt to understand previous scientific texts in terms of their contemporary context and not in terms of modern science kuhn’s concern was more than historical accuracy rather he was interested in recapturing the thought processes that lead to a change in theory although structure was kuhn’s articulation of this process for scientific change the terminology in the monograph did not represent a straightjacket for narrating history for kuhn the terminology and vocabulary like paradigm and normal science used in structure were not products such as metaphysical categories to which a historical narrative must conform rather they had a different metaphysical function—as presuppositions towards an historical narrative as process in other words structure’s terminology and vocabulary were tools by which to reconstruct a scientific historical narrative and not a template for articulating it the purpose of history of science according to kuhn was not just getting the facts straight but providing philosophers of science with an accurate image of science to practice their trade kuhn fervently believed that the new historiography of science would prevent philosophers from engaging in the excesses and distortions prevalent within traditional philosophy of science he envisioned history of science informing philosophy of science as historical philosophy of science rather than history and philosophy of science since the relationship was asymmetrical prior to  history of science was a discipline practiced mostly by eminent scientists who generally wrote heroic biographies or sweeping overviews of a discipline often for pedagogical purposes within the past generation historians of science such as alexander koyré anneliese maier and ej dijsterhuis developed an approach to the history of science that was simply more than chronicling science’s theoretical and technical achievements an important factor in that development was the recognition of institutional and sociological factors in the practice of science a consequence of this historiographic revolution was the distinction between internal and external histories of science internal history of science is concerned with the development of the theories and methods employed by scientists in other words it studies the history of events people and ideas internal to scientific advancement the historian as internalist attempts to climb inside the mind of scientists as they push forward the boundaries of their discipline external history of science concentrates on the social and cultural factors that impinge on the practice of science for kuhn the distinction between internal and external histories of science mapped onto his pattern of scientific development external or cultural and social factors are important during a scientific discipline’s initial establishment however once established those factors no longer have a major impact on a community’s practice or its generation of scientific knowledge they can have a minor impact on a mature science’s practice such as the timing of technological innovation importantly for kuhn internal and external approaches to the history of science are not necessarily mutually exclusive but complementary b metahistorical studies as mentioned already kuhn considered himself a practitioner of both the history of science and the philosophy of science and not the history and philosophy of science for a very practical reason crassly put the goal for history is the particular while for philosophy the universal kuhn compared the differences between the two disciplines to a duckrabbit gestalt switch in other words the two disciplines are so fundamentally different in terms of their goals that the resulting images of science are incommensurable moreover to see the other discipline’s image requires a conversion for kuhn then the history of science and the philosophy of science cannot be practiced at the same time but only alternatively and then with difficulty how then can the history of science be of use to philosophers of science the answer for kuhn was by providing an accurate image of science rejecting the covering law model for historical explanation because it reduces historians to mere social scientists kuhn advocated an image based on ordering of historical facts into a narrative analogous to the one he proposed for puzzle solving under the aegis of a paradigm in the physical sciences historians of science as they narrate change in science provide an image of science that reflects the process by which scientific information develops rather than the image provided by traditional philosophers of science in which scientific knowledge is simply a product of logical verification or falsification kuhn insisted that the history of science and the philosophy of science remain distinct disciplines so that historians of science can provide an image of science to correct the distortion produced by traditional philosophers of science according to kuhn the social history of science also distorts the image of science for social historians scientists construct rather than discover scientific knowledge although kuhn was sympathetic to this type of history he believed it created a gap between older constructions and the ones replacing them which he challenged historians of science to fill besides social historians of science kuhn also accused sociologists of science for distorting the image of science although kuhn acknowledged that factors such as interests power authority among others are important in the production of scientific knowledge the predominant use of them by sociologists eclipses other factors such as nature itself the key to rectifying the distortion introduced by sociologists is to shift from a rationality of belief that is the reasons scientists hold specific beliefs to a rationality of change in beliefs that is the reasons scientists change their beliefs for kuhn a historical philosophy of science was the means for correcting these distortions of the scientific image kuhn’s historical philosophy of science focused on the metahistorical issues derived from historical research particularly scientific development and the related issues of theory choice and incommensurability importantly for kuhn both theory choice and incommensurability are intimately linked to one another the former cannot be reduced to an algorithm of objective rules but requires subjective values because of the latter kuhn explored scientific development using three different approaches the first was in terms of problem versus puzzle solving according to kuhn problems have no ready solution and problem solving is often generally pragmatic and is the hallmark of an underdeveloped or immature science puzzles on the other hand occupy the attention of scientists involved in a developed or mature science although they have guaranteed solutions the methods for solving puzzles are not assured scientists who solve them demonstrate their ingenuity and are rewarded by the community with this distinction in mind kuhn envisioned scientific development as the transition of a scientific discipline from an underdeveloped problemsolving state to a developed puzzlesolving one the question then arises as to how this occurs the answer that many took from structure was adopt a paradigm however kuhn found this answer to be incorrect in that paradigms are not unique only to the sciences but does articulating the question in terms of puzzlesolving help kuhn’s answer was pragmatic that is keep trying different solutions until one works in other words philosophers of science had no exemplars by which to solve their problems kuhn’s second approach to scientific development was in terms of the growth of knowledge he proposed an alternative view to the traditional one that scientific knowledge grows by a piecemeal accumulation of facts to shed light on the alternative view kuhn offered a different reconstruction of science the central ideas of a science cohere with one another forming a set of the central ideas or core of a particular science besides the core a periphery exists which represents an area where scientists can investigate problems associated with a research tradition without changing core ideas kuhn then drew parallels between the current reconstruction of science and the earlier one in structure obviously the transition in cores from one research tradition to another is a scientific revolution moreover the core represents a paradigm that defines a particular research tradition finally the periphery is identified with normal science the core then provides the means by which to practice science and to change the core requires significant retooling that practitioners naturally resist is this change in the core a growth of knowledge to answer the question kuhn examined the standard account of knowledge as justified true belief what he found problematic with the account is the amount or nature of the evidence needed to justify a belief and this of course raises the issue of truth for which he had no ready solution ultimately kuhn equivocated on the question of the growth of knowledge kuhn’s final approach to scientific development was through the analysis of three scientific revolutions the shift from aristotelian to newtonian physics volta’s discovery of the electric cell and planck’s blackbody radiation research and quantum discontinuity from these examples kuhn derived three characteristics of scientific revolutions the first was holistic in that scientific revolutions are allornone events the second was the way referents change after revolutions especially in terms of taxonomic categories according to kuhn revolutions redistribute objects among these categories the final characteristic of scientific revolutions was a change in a discipline’s analogy metaphor or model which represents the connection between taxonomic categories and the world’s structure according to traditional philosophers of science the objective features of a good scientific theory include accuracy consistency scope simplicity and fecundity however these features when used individually as criteria for theory choice argued kuhn are imprecise and often conflict with one another although necessary for theory choice they are insufficient and must include the characteristics of the scientists making the choices these characteristics involve personal experiences or biography and personality or psychological traits in other words not only does theory choice rely on a theory’s objective features but also on individual scientists’ subjective characteristics why have traditional philosophers of science ignored or neglected subjective factors in theory choice part of the answer is that they confined the subjective to the context of discovery while restricting the objective to the context of justification kuhn insisted that this distinction does not fit with observations of scientific practice it is artificial reflecting science pedagogy but actual scientific practice reveals that textbook presentations of theory choice are stylized to convince students who rely on the authority of their instructors what else can students do textbook science discloses only the product of science not its process for kuhn since subjective factors are present at the discovery phase of science they should also be present at the justification phase according to kuhn objective criteria function as values which do not dictate theory choice but rather influence it values help to explain scientists’ behavior which for the traditional philosopher of science may at times appear irrational most importantly values account for disagreement over theories and help to distribute risk during debates over theories kuhn’s position had important consequences for the philosophy of science he maintained that critics misinterpreted his position on theory choice as subjective for them the term denoted a matter of taste that is not rationally discussable but his use of the term did involve the discussable with respect to standards moreover kuhn denied that facts are theory independent and that there is strictly a rational choice to be made rather he contended scientists do not choose a theory based on objective criteria alone but are converted based on subjective values finally kuhn discussed theory choice with respect to the incommensurability thesis the question he entertained was what type of communication is possible among community members holding competing theories the answer according to kuhn is that communication is partial the answer raised a second and more important question for kuhn and his critics is good reason visàvis empirical evidence available to justify theory choice given such partial communication the answer would be straightforward if communication was complete but it is not for kuhn this situation meant that ultimately reasonable evaluation of the empirical evidence is not compelling for theory choice and of course raised the charge of irrationality which he denied kuhn identified two common misconceptions of his version of the incommensurability thesis the first was that since two incommensurable theories cannot be stated in a common language then they be cannot compared to one another in order to choose between them the second was that since an older theory cannot be translated into modern expression it cannot be articulated meaningfully kuhn addressed the first misconception by distinguishing between incommensurability as no common measure and as no common language he defined the incommensurability thesis in terms of the latter rather than the former most theoretical terms are homophonic and can have the same meaning in two competing theories however only a handful of terms are incommensurable or untranslatable kuhn considered this a modest version of the incommensurability thesis calling it local incommensurability and claimed that it was his originally intention although there may be no common language to compare terms that change their meaning during a scientific revolution there is a partially common language composed of the invariant terms that do permit some semblance of comparison thus kuhn argued the first criticism fails because and this was his main point an incommensurate residue remains even with a partially common language as for the second misconception kuhn claimed that critics conflate the difference between translation and interpretation the conflation is understandable since translation often involves interpretation translation for kuhn is the process by which words or phrases of one language substitute for another interpretation however involves attempts to make sense of a statement or to make it intelligible incommensurability then does not mean that a theoretical term cannot be interpreted that is cannot be made intelligible rather it means that the term cannot be translated that is there is no equivalent for the term in the competing theoretical language in other words in order for the theoretical term to have meaning the scientist must go native in its use kuhn introduced the notion of the lexicon and its attendant taxonomy to capture both a term’s reference and intention or sense in the lexicon there are referring terms that are interrelated to other referring terms that is the holistic principle the lexicon’s structure of interrelated terms resembles the world’s structure in terms of its taxonomic categories a particular scientific community uses its lexicon to describe and explain the world in terms of this taxonomy and members of a community or of different communities must share the same lexicon if they are to communicate fully with one another moreover claimed kuhn if full translation is to be achieved the two languages must share a similar structure with respect to their respective lexicons incommensurability then reflects lexicons that have different taxonomic structures by which the world is carved up and articulated kuhn also addressed a problem that involves communication among communities who hold incommensurable theories or who occupy positions across a historical divide kuhn noted that although lexicons can change dramatically this does not deter members from reconstructing their past in the current lexicon’s vocabulary such reconstruction obviously plays an important function in the community but the issue is that given the incommensurable nature of theories assessments of true and false or right and wrong are unwarranted for which critics charged kuhn with a relativist position—a position he was less inclined to deny the charge stemmed from the fact that kuhn advocated no privileged position from which to evaluate a theory rather evaluations must be made within the context of a particular lexicon and thus evaluations are relative to the relevant lexicon but kuhn found the charge of relativism trivial he acknowledged that his position on the relativity of truth and objectivity with respect to the community’s lexicon left him no option but to take literally world changes associated with lexical changes but is this an idealist position kuhn admitted that it appears to be but he claimed that it is an idealism like none other on the one hand the world is composed of the community’s lexicon but one the other hand preconceived ideas cannot mold it c evolutionary philosophy of science from the mids to earlys kuhn transitioned from historical philosophy of science and the paradigm concept to an evolutionary philosophy of science and the lexicon notion to that end he identified an alternative role for the incommensurability thesis with respect to segregating or isolating lexicons and their associated worlds from one another incommensurability now functioned for kuhn as a mechanism to isolate a community’s lexicon from another’s and as a means to underpin a notion of scientific progress as the proliferation of scientific specialties in other words as the taxonomical structure of the two lexicons become isolated and thereby incommensurable with one another according to kuhn a new specialty and its lexicon split off from the old or parent specialty and its lexicon this process accounts for a notion of scientific progress as an increase in the number of scientific specialties after a revolution scientific progress then is akin to biological speciation argued kuhn with incommensurability serving as the isolation mechanism the result is a treelike structure with increased specialization at the tips of the branches finally kuhn’s evolutionary philosophy of science is nonteleological in the sense that science progresses not towards an ultimate truth about the world but simply away from a lexicon that cannot be used to solve its anomalies to one that can however he still articulated incommensurability in terms of no common language with its attendant problems involving the notion of meaning and did not transform it fully with respect to an evolutionary philosophy of science kuhn was working out an evolutionary philosophy of science in a proposed book words and worlds an evolutionary view of scientific development he divided it into three parts with three chapters in each in the first part kuhn framed the problem associated with the incommensurability thesis and addressed the difficulties accessing past scientific achievements in the first chapter he presented an evolutionary view of scientific development without an archimedean platform to guide theory assessment kuhn proposed a comparative method for assessing theoretical changes the method forbids assessment of theories in isolation and methodological solecism in the next chapter he discussed the problems associated with examining past historical studies in science based on several historical cases he claimed that anomalies in older scientific texts could be understood only through an interpretative process involving an ethnographic or a hermeneutical reading he had now laid the groundwork for examining the incommensurability thesis in the third chapter kuhn discussed the changes of wordmeanings as changes in a taxonomy embedded in a lexicon—an apparatus of a language’s referring terms the result of these changes was an untranslatable gap between two incommensurable theories finally the lexical terms referring to objects change as the number of scientific specialties proliferate in the book’s second part kuhn continued to explore the nature of a community’s lexicon which he explicated in terms of taxonomic categories these categories are grouped as contrast sets and no overlap of categories exists within the same contrast set which kuhn called the nooverlap principle the principle prohibits the reference of terms to objects unless related to one another as species to genus moreover the properties of the categories are reflected in the properties of their names a term’s meaning then is a function of its taxonomic category and this restriction is the origin of untranslatability in the first chapter of this part kuhn discussed the nature of substances in terms of sortal predicates this move allowed kuhn to introduce plasticity into the lexicon’s usage moreover the differentiating set is not strictly conventional but relies on the world to which the different sets connect in the next chapter kuhn extended the lexicon notion to artifacts abstractions and theoretical entities in the final chapter of the second part kuhn specified the means by which community members acquire a lexicon first they must already possess a vocabulary about physical entities and forces next definitions play little if any role in learning new terms rather those terms are acquired through ostensive examples especially through problem solving and laboratory demonstrations third a single example is inadequate to learn the meaning of a term rather multiple examples are required next acquisition of a new term within a statement also requires acquisition of other new terms within that statement and lastly students can acquire the terms of a lexicon through different pedagogical routes in the book’s concluding part kuhn discussed what occurs during a change in the lexicon and the implications for scientific development in chapter seven he examined the means by which lexicons change and the repercussions such change has for communication among communities with different lexicons moreover he explored the role of arguments in lexical change in the subsequent chapter kuhn identified the type of progress achieved with changes in lexicons he maintained that progress is not the type that aims at a specific goal but rather is instrumental in the final chapter he broached the issues of relativism and realism not in traditional terms of truth and objectivity but rather with respect to the capability of making a statement statements from incommensurable theories that cannot be translated are ultimately ineffable they can be neither true nor false but their capability of being stated is relative to the community’s history in sum the book’s aim was certainly to address the philosophical issues left over from structure but more importantly it was to resolve the problems generated by a historical philosophy of science although others were also responsible for its creation kuhn assumed responsibility for resolving the problems and the sine qua non for resolving them was the incommensurability thesis for kuhn the thesis was required more than ever to defend rationality from the postmodern development of the strong program  conclusion in may  a conference—or as hempel called it a kuhnfest—was held in kuhn’s honor at mit sponsored by the sloan foundation and organized by paul horwich and judith thomson the conference speakers included jed buchwald nancy cartwright john earman michael friedman ian hacking john heilbron ernan mcmullin nm swerdlow and norton wise the papers reflected kuhn’s impact on the history and the philosophy of science hempel made a special appearance on the last day followed by kuhn’s remarks on the conference papers as he approached the podium after hempel’s remarks before a standingroomonly audience kuhn was visibly moved by the outpouring of professional appreciation for his contributions to a discipline that he cherished and from its members whom he truly respected kuhn retired from teaching in  and became an emeritus professor at mit during kuhn’s career he received numerous awards and accolades he was the recipient of honorary degrees from around a dozen academic institutions such as university of chicago columbia university university of padua and university of notre dame he was elected a member of the national academy of science—the most prestigious society for us scientists—and was an honorary life member of the new york academy of science and a corresponding fellow of the british academy he was president of the history of science society from  to  and the society awarded him its highest honor the sarton medal in  kuhn was also the recipient in  of the howard t behrman award for distinguished achievement in the humanities and in  of the

historian and philosopher of science through the support of harvard’s president james conant in  kuhn’s renowned the structure of scientific revolutions structure helped to inaugurate a revolution—the s historiographic revolution—by providing a new image of science for kuhn scientific revolutions involved paradigm shifts that punctuated periods of stasis or normal science towards the end of his career however kuhn underwent a paradigm shift of his own—from a historical philosophy of science to an evolutionary one in this article kuhn’s philosophy of science is reconstructed chronologically to that end the following questions are entertained what was kuhn’s early life and career what was the road towards structure what is structure why did kuhn revise structure what was the road kuhn took after structure at the heart of the answers to these questions is the person of kuhn himself especially the intellectual and social context in which he practiced his trade this chronological reconstruction of kuhn’s philosophy begins with his work in the s on physical theory in the lowell lectures and on the copernican revolution and ends with his work in the s on an evolutionary philosophy of science rather than present kuhn’s philosophy as a finished product this approach endeavors to capture it in the process of its formation so as to represent it accurately and faithfully

historical and historiographic studies metahistorical studies evolutionary philosophy of science conclusion references and further reading kuhn’s work secondary sources  early life and career kuhn was born in cincinnati ohio on  july  he was the first of two children born to samuel l and minette neè stroock kuhn with a brother roger born several years later his father was a native cincinnatian and his mother a native new yorker kuhn’s father sam was a hydraulic engineer trained at harvard university and at massachusetts institute of technology mit prior to world war i he entered the war and served in the army corps of engineers after leaving the armed services sam returned to cincinnati for several years before moving to new york to help his recently widowed mother setty neè swartz kuhn kuhn’s mother minette was a liberally educated person who came from an affluent family kuhn’s early education reflected the family’s liberal progressiveness in  kuhn began schooling at the progressive lincoln school in manhattan his early education taught him to think independently but by his own admission there was little content to the thinking he remembered that by the second grade for instance he was unable to read proficiently much to the consternation of his parents beginning in the sixth grade kuhn’s family moved to crotononhudson a small town about fifty miles from manhattan and the adolescent kuhn attended the progressive hessian hills school according to kuhn the school was staffed by leftoriented radical teachers who taught the students pacifism when he left the school after the ninth grade kuhn felt he was a bright and independent thinker after spending an uninspired year at the preparatory school solebury in pennsylvania kuhn spent his last two years of high school at the yalepreparatory taft school in watertown connecticut he graduated third in his class of  students and was inducted into the national honor society he also received the prestigious rensselaer alumni association medal kuhn matriculated to harvard college in the fall of  following his father’s and uncles’ footsteps at harvard he acquired a better sense of himself socially by participating in various organizations during his first year kuhn took a yearlong philosophy course in the first semester he studied plato and aristotle while in the second semester he studied descartes spinoza hume and kant he intended to take additional philosophy courses but could not find time he attended however several of george sarton’s lectures on the history of science but he found them boring at harvard kuhn agonized over majoring in either physics or mathematics after seeking his father’s counsel he chose physics because of career opportunities interestingly the attraction of physics or mathematics was their problemsolving traditions in the fall of his sophomore year the japanese attacked pearl harbor and kuhn expedited his undergraduate education by going to summer school the physics department focused on teaching predominantly electronics and kuhn followed suit kuhn underwent another radical transformation also during his sophomore year although he was trained a pacifist the atrocities perpetrated in europe during world war ii especially by hitler horrified him kuhn experienced a crisis since he was unable to defend pacifism reasonably the outcome was that he became an interventionist which was the position of many at harvard—especially its president conant the episode left a lasting impact upon him in a harvard crimson editorial kuhn supported conant’s effort to militarize the universities in the united states the editorial came to the attention of the administration and eventually conant and kuhn met in the spring of  kuhn graduated summa cum laude from harvard college with an sb after graduation he worked for the radio research laboratory located in harvard’s biology building he conducted research on radar counter technology under john van vleck’s supervision the job procured for kuhn a deferment from the draft after a year he requested a transfer to england and then to the continent where he worked in association with the us office of scientific research and development the trip was kuhn’s first abroad and he felt invigorated by the experience however kuhn realized that he did not like radar work which led him to reconsider whether he wanted to continue as a physicist but these doubts did not dampen his enthusiasm for or belief in science during this time kuhn had the opportunity to read what he wanted he read in the philosophy of science including authors such as bertrand russell pw bridgman rudolf carnap and philipp frank after ve day in  kuhn returned to harvard as the war abated with the dropping of atomic bombs on japan kuhn activated an earlier acceptance into graduate school and began studies in the physics department although kuhn persuaded the department to permit him to take philosophy courses during his first year he again chose the pragmatic course and focused on physics in  kuhn passed the general examinations and received a master’s degree in physics he then began dissertation research on theoretical solidstate physics under the direction of van vleck in  harvard awarded kuhn a doctorate in physics although kuhn had high regard for science especially physics he was unfulfilled as a physicist and continually harbored doubts during graduate school about a career in physics he had chosen both a dissertation topic and an advisor to expedite obtaining a degree but he was to find direction for his career through conant’s invitation in  to help prepare a historical casebased course on science for upperlevel undergraduates kuhn accepted the invitation to be one of two assistants for conant’s course he undertook a project investigating the origins of seventeenthcentury mechanics a project that would transform his image of science that transformation came as kuhn recounted later on a summer day in  as he struggled to understand aristotle’s idea of motion in physics the problem was that kuhn tried to make sense of aristotle’s idea of motion using newtonian assumptions and categories of motion once he realized that he had to read aristotle’s physics using assumptions and categories contemporary to when the greek philosopher wrote it suddenly aristotle’s idea of motion made sense after this experience kuhn realized that he wanted to be a philosopher of science by doing history of science his interest was not strictly history of science but philosophy for he felt that philosophy was the way to truth and truth was what he was after to achieve that goal kuhn asked conant to sponsor him as a junior fellow in the harvard society of fellows harvard initiated the society to provide promising young scholars freedom from teaching for three years to develop a scholarly program kuhn’s colleagues stimulated him professionally especially a senior fellow by the name of willard quine at the time quine was publishing his critique on the distinction between the analytic and the synthetic which kuhn found reassuring for his own thinking kuhn began as a fellow in the fall of  which provided him the opportunity to retool as a historian of science kuhn took advantage of the opportunity and read widely over the next year and a half in the humanities and sciences just prior to his appointment as a fellow kuhn was also undergoing psychoanalysis this experience allowed him to see other people’s perspectives and contributed to his approach for conducting historical research  the road to structure a the lowell lectures in  the trustee of the lowell institute ralph lowell invited kuhn to deliver the  lowell lectures in these lectures kuhn outlined a conception of science in contrast to the traditional philosophy of science’s conception in which facts are slowly accumulated and stockpiled in textbooks kuhn began by assuring his audience that he as a once practicing scientist believed that science produces useful and cumulative knowledge of the world but that traditional analysis of science distorts the process by which scientific knowledge develops he went on to inform the audience that the history of science could be instructive for identifying the process by which creative science advances rather than focusing on the finished product promulgated in textbooks because textbooks only state the immutable scientific laws and marshal forth the experimental evidence to support those laws they cover over the creative process that leads to the laws in the first place kuhn then presented an alternative historical approach to scientific methodology he claimed that the traditional position in which galileo rejected aristotle’s physics because of galileo’s experiments is a fallacy rather galileo rejected aristotelianism as an entire system in other words galileo’s evidence was necessary but not sufficient rather the aristotelian system was under evaluation which also included its logic next kuhn proposed an alternative image of science based on the new approach to the history of science he introduced the notion of conceptual frameworks and drew from psychology to defend the advancement of science though scientists’ predispositions these predispositions allow scientists to negotiate a professional world and to learn from their experiences moreover they are important in organizing the scientist’s professional world and scientists do not dispense with them easily change in them represents a foundational alteration in a professional world kuhn argued that although logic is important for deriving meaning and for managing and manipulating knowledge scientific language—as natural—outstrips such formalization he upended the tables on an important tool for the traditional analysis of science by revealing the limitations of logical analysis he showed that logic is necessary but insufficient for justifying scientific knowledge logic then cannot guarantee the traditional image of science as the progressive accumulation of scientific facts kuhn next examined logical analysis in terms of language and meaning his position was that language is a way of dissecting the professional world in which scientists operate but there is always ambiguity or overlap in the meaning of terms as that world is dissected certainly scientists attempt to increase the precision of their terms but not to the point that they can eliminate ambiguity kuhn concluded by distinguishing between creative and textbook science in the same year of the lowell lectures harvard appointed kuhn as an instructor and the following year as an assistant professor kuhn’s primary teaching duty was in the general education curriculum where he taught natural sciences  along with leonard nash he also taught courses in the history of science and it was during this time that kuhn developed a course on the history of cosmology kuhn utilized course preparation for scholarly writing projects for example he handed out draft chapters of the copernican revolution to his classes a part of kuhn’s motivation for developing a new image of science was the misconceptions of science held by the public he blamed its misconceptions on introductory courses that stressed the textbook image of science as a fixed body of facts after discussing this state of affairs with friends and conant kuhn provided students with a more accurate image of science the key to that image claimed kuhn was science’s history which displays the creative and dynamic nature of science b the copernican revolution in the copernican revolution kuhn claimed he had identified an important feature of the revolution which previous scholars had missed its plurality what kuhn meant by plurality was that scientists have philosophical and even religious commitments which are important for the justification of scientific knowledge this stance was anathema to traditional philosophers of science who believed that such commitments played little—if any—role in the justification of scientific knowledge and relegated them to the discovery process kuhn began reconstruction of the copernican revolution by establishing the genuine scientific character of ancient cosmological conceptual schemes especially the twosphere cosmology composed of an inner sphere for the earth and an outer sphere for the heavens for kuhn conceptual schemes exhibit three important features they are comprehensive in terms of scientific predictions there is no final proof for them and they are derived from other schemes finally to be successful conceptual schemes must perform logical and psychological functions the logical function is expressed in explanatory terms while the psychological function in existential terms although the logical function of the twosphere cosmology continued to be problematic its psychological function afforded adherents a comprehensive worldview that included even religious elements the major logical problem with the twosphere cosmology was the movement and positions of the planets the conceptual scheme ptolemy developed in the second century guided research for the next millennium but problems surfaced with the scheme and predecessors could only correct it so far with ad hoc modifications kuhn asked at this point in the narrative why the ptolemaic system given its imperfection was not overthrown sooner the answer for kuhn depended on a distinction between the logical and psychological dimensions of scientific revolutions according to kuhn there are logically different conceptual schemes that can organize and account for observations the difference among these schemes is their predictive power consequently if an observation is made that is not compatible with a prediction the scheme must be replaced but before change can occur there is also the psychological dimension to a revolution copernicus had to overcome not only the logical dimension of the ptolemaic system but also its psychological dimension aristotle had established this latter dimension by wedding the twosphere cosmology to a philosophical system through the aristotelian notion of motion among the earthly and heavenly spheres the inner sphere was connected and depended on the outer sphere the ability to presage future events linked astronomy to astrology such an alliance according to kuhn provided a formidable obstacle to change of any kind but change began to take place albeit slowly from aristotle to ptolemy a sharp distinction arose between the psychological dimensions of cosmology and the mathematical precision of astronomy by ptolemy’s time astronomy was less concerned with the psychological dimensions of data interpretation and more with the accuracy of theoretical prediction to some extent this aided copernicus since whether the earth moved could be determined by theoretical analysis of the empirical data but still the earth as center of the universe gave existential consolation to people the strands of the copernican revolution then included not only astronomical concerns but also theological economic and social ones besides the scholastic tradition with its impetus theory of motion other factors also paved the way for the copernican revolution including the protestant revolution navigation for oceanic voyages calendar reform and renaissance humanism and neoplatonism copernicus according to kuhn was the immediate inheritor of aristotelianptolemaic cosmological tradition and except for the position of the earth was closer to that tradition than to modern astronomy for kuhn de revolutionibus precipitated a revolution and was not the revolution itself although the problem copernicus addressed was the same as for his predecessors that is planetary motion his solution was to revise the mathematical model for that motion by making the earth a planet that moves around the sun essentially copernicus maintained the aristotelianptolemaic universe but exchanged the sun for the earth as the universe’s center although copernicus had eliminated major epicycles he still used minor ones and the accuracy of planetary position was no better than ptolemy’s kuhn concluded that copernicus did not really solve the problem of planetary motion initially according to kuhn there were only a few supporters of copernicus’ cosmology although the majority of astronomers accepted the mathematical harmonies of de revolutionibus after its publication in  they rejected or ignored its cosmology tycho brahe for example although relying on copernican harmonies to explain astronomical data proposed a system in which the earth was still the universe’s center essentially it was a compromise between ancient cosmology and copernican mathematical astronomy however brahe recorded accurate and precise astronomical observations which helped to compel others towards copernicanism—particularly johannes kepler who used its mathematical precision to solve the planetary motion problem the final player kuhn considered in the revolution was galileo who kuhn claimed provided through telescopic observations not proof of but rather propaganda for copernicanism although astronomers achieved consensus during the seventeenth century copernicanism still faced serious resistance from christianity the copernican revolution was completed with the newtonian universe which not only had an impact on astronomy but also on other sciences and even nonsciences for instance newton’s universe changed the nature of god to that of a clockmaker for kuhn newtonian’s impact on disciplines other than astronomy was an example of its fruitfulness scientific progress concluded kuhn is not the linear process as championed by traditional philosophers of science in which scientific facts are stockpiled in a warehouse rather it is the repeated destruction and replacement of scientific theories the professional reviews of the copernican revolution signaled kuhn’s acceptance into the philosophical and historical communities his reconstruction of the revolution was considered for the most part scientifically accurate and methodologically appropriate reviewers considered integration of the science and the social an advance over other histories that ignored these dimensions of the historical narrative although philosophers appreciated the historical dimension of kuhn’s study they found its analysis imprecise according to their standards overall both the historical and philosophical communities expressed no major objections to the image of science that animated kuhn’s narrative kuhn’s reconstruction of the copernican revolution portrayed a radically different image of science than that of traditional philosophers of science justification of scientific knowledge was not simply a logical or objective affair but also included nonlogical or subjective factors according to kuhn scientific progress is not a clearsighted linear process aimed directly at the truth rather there are contingencies that can divert and forestall the progress of science moreover copernicus’ revolution changed the way astronomers and nonastronomers viewed the world this change in perceiving the world was the result of new sets of challenges new techniques and a new hermeneutics for interpreting data besides differing from traditional philosophers of science kuhn’s image of science put him at odds with whig historians of science these historians underrated ancient cosmologies by degrading them to myth or religious belief such a move was often a rhetorical ploy on the part of the victors to enhance the status of the current scientific theory only by showing how aristotelianptolemaic geocentric astronomy was authentic science could kuhn argue for the radical transformation revolution that copernican heliocentric astronomy invoked kuhn also asserted that copernicus’ theory was not accepted simply for its predictive ability since it was not as accurate as the original conceptual scheme but because of nonempirical factors such as the simplicity of copernican’s system in which certain ad hoc modifications for accounting for the orbits of various planets were eliminated in  harvard denied kuhn tenure because the tenure committee felt his book on the copernican revolution was too popular in its approach and analysis a friend of kuhn knew steven pepper who was chair of the philosophy department at the university of california at berkeley kuhn’s friend told pepper that kuhn was looking for an academic position pepper’s department was searching for someone to establish a program in the history and philosophy of science berkeley eventually offered kuhn a position in the philosophy department and later asked if he also wanted an appointment in the history department kuhn accepted both positions and joined the berkeley faculty as an assistant professor kuhn found stanley cavell in the philosophy department a soulmate to replace nash kuhn had meet cavell earlier while they were both fellows at harvard cavell was an ethicist and aesthetician whom kuhn found intellectually stimulating he introduced kuhn to wittgenstein’s notion of language games besides cavell kuhn developed a professional relationship with paul feyerabend who was also working on the notion of incommensurability in  berkeley promoted kuhn to associate professor and granted him tenure moreover having completed several historical projects he was ready to return to the philosophical issues that first attracted him to the history of science beginning in the fall of  he spent a year as a fellow at the center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences at stanford california what struck kuhn about the relationships among behavioral and social scientists was their inability to agree on the fundamental problems and practices of their discipline although natural scientists do not necessarily have the right answers to their questions there is an agreement over fundamentals this difference between natural and social scientists eventually led kuhn to formulate the paradigm concept c the last mile to structure although the copernican revolution represented a significant advance in kuhn’s articulation of a revolutionary theory of science several issues still needed attention what was missing from kuhn’s reconstruction of the copernican revolution was an understanding of how scientists function on a daily basis when an impending revolution is not looming that understanding emerged gradually during the last mile on the road to structure in terms of three papers written from the midfifties to the early sixties in the first paper ‘the function of measurement in modern physical science’ kuhn challenged the belief that if scientists cannot measure a phenomenon then their knowledge of it is inadequate or not scientific part of the reason for kuhn’s concern over measurement in science was its textbook tradition which he believed perpetuates a myth about measurement that is misleading kuhn compared the textbook presentation of measurement to a machine in which scientists feed laws and theories along with initial conditions into the machine’s hopper at the top turn a handle on the side representing logical and mathematical operations and then collect numerical predictions exiting the machine’s chute in the front scientists finally compare experimental observations to theoretical predictions the function of these measurements serves as a test of the theory which is the confirmation function of measurement kuhn claimed that the above function is not why measurements are reported in textbooks rather measurements are reported to give the reader an idea of what the professional community believes is reasonable agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental observations reasonable agreement however depends upon approximate not exact agreement between theory and data and differs from one science to the next moreover external criteria do not exist for determining reasonableness for kuhn the actual function of normal measurement in science is found in its journal articles that function is neither invention of novel theories nor the confirmation of older ones discovery and exploratory measurements in science instead are rare the reason is that changes in theories which require discovery or confirmation occur during revolutions which are also quite rare once a revolution occurs moreover the new theory only exhibits potential for ordering and explaining natural phenomena the function of normal measurement is to tighten reasonable agreement between novel theoretical predictions and experimental observations the textbook tradition is also misleading in terms of normal measurement’s effects it claims that theories must conform to quantitative facts such facts are not the given but the expected and the scientist’s task is to obtain them this obligation to obtain the expected quantitative fact is often the incentive for developing novel technology moreover a welldeveloped theoretical system is required for meaningful measurement in science besides the function of normal or expected measurement kuhn also examined the function of extraordinary measurement—which pertain to unexpected results it is this latter type of measurement that exhibits the discovery and confirmatory functions when normal scientific practice results consistently in unexpected anomalies this leads to crisis and extraordinary measurement often aids to resolve it crisis then leads to the invention of new theories again extraordinary measurement plays a critical role in this process theory invention in response to quantitative anomalies leads to decisive measurements for judging a novel theory’s adequacy whereas qualitative anomalies generally lead to ad hoc modifications of theories extraordinary measurement allows scientists to choose among competing theories kuhn was moving closer towards a notion of normal science through an analysis of normal measurement in contrast to extraordinary measurement in science his conception of science continued to distance him from traditional philosophers of science but the notion of normal measurement was not as robust as he needed importantly kuhn was changing the agenda for philosophy of science from justification of scientific theories as finished products in textbooks to dynamic process by which theories are tested and assimilated into the professional literature a robust notion of normal science was the revolutionary concept he needed to overturn the traditional image of science as an accumulated body of facts with the introduction of normal and extraordinary measurement the step towards the notions of normal and extraordinary science in kuhn’s revolutionary image of science was imminent kuhn worked out those notions in the essential tension he began by addressing the notion that creative thinking in science assumes a particular assumption of science in which science advances through unbridled imagination and divergent thinking—which involves identifying multiple avenues by which to solve a problem and determining which one works best kuhn acknowledged that such thinking is responsible for some scientific progress but he proposed that convergent thinking—which limits itself to welldefined often logical steps for solving a problem—is also an important means of progress while revolutions which depend on divergent thinking are an obvious means for scientific progress kuhn insisted that few scientists consciously design revolutionary experiments rather most scientists engage in normal research which represents convergent thinking but occasionally scientists may break with the tradition of normal science and replace it with a new tradition science as a profession is both traditional and iconoclastic and the tension between them often creates a space in which to practice it next kuhn utilized the term paradigm while discussing the pedagogical advantages of convergent thinking—especially as displayed in science textbooks whereas textbooks in other disciplines include the methodological and conceptual conflicts prevalent within the discipline science textbooks do not rather science education is the transmission of a tradition that guides the activities of practitioners in science education students are taught not to evaluate the tradition but to accept it progress within normal research projects represents attempts to bring theory and observation into closer agreement and to extend a theory’s scope to new phenomena given the convergent and traditionbound nature of science education and of scientific practice how can normal research be a means for the generation of revolutionary knowledge and technology according to kuhn a mature science provides the background that allows practitioners to identify nontrivial problems or anomalies with a paradigm in other words without mature science there can be no revolution kuhn continued to develop the notion of normal research and its convergent thinking in ‘the function of dogma in scientific research’ he began with the traditional image of science as an objective and critical enterprise although this is the ideal the reality is that often scientists already know what to expect from their investigations of natural phenomena if the expected is not forthcoming then scientists must struggle to find conformity between what they expect and what they observe which textbooks encode as dogmas dogmas are critical for the practice of normal science and for advancement in it because they define the puzzles for the profession and stipulate the criteria for their solution kuhn next expanded the range of paradigms to embrace scientific practice in general rather than simply as a model for research specifically paradigms include not only a community’s previous scientific achievements but also its theoretical concepts the experimental techniques and protocols and even the natural entities in short they are the community’s body of beliefs or foundations paradigms are also openended in terms of solving problems moreover they are exclusive in their nature in that there is only one paradigm per mature science finally they are not permanent fixtures of the scientific landscape for eventually paradigms are replaceable importantly for kuhn when a paradigm replaces another the two paradigms are radically different having done paradigmatic spadework kuhn then discussed the notion of normal scientific research the process of matching paradigm and nature includes extending and applying the paradigm to expected but also unexpected parts of nature this does not necessarily mean discovering the unknown as it does explaining the known although the dogma paper is only a fragment of the solution to problems associated with the traditional image of science the complete solution was soon to appear in structure  the structure of scientific revolutions in july  kuhn completed a draft of structure and in  it was published as the final monograph in the second volume of neurath’s international encyclopedia of unified science charles morris was instrumental in its publication and carnap served as its editor structure was not a single publishing event in  rather it covered the years from  to  after its publication kuhn was engrossed for the rest of the sixties addressing criticisms directed to the ideas contained in it especially the paradigm concept during this time he continued to develop and refine his new image of science the endpoint was a second edition of structure that appeared in  the text of the revised edition however remained essentially unaltered and only a ‘postscript—’ was added in which kuhn addressed his critics what kuhn proposed in structure was a new image of science that image differed radically from the traditional one the difference hinged on a shift from a logical analysis and an explanation of scientific knowledge as finished product to a historical narration and description of scientific practices by which a community of practitioners produces scientific knowledge in short it was a shift from the subject the product to the verb to produce according to the traditional image science is a repository of accumulated facts discovered by individuals at specific periods in history one of the central tasks of traditional historians given this image of science was to answer questions about who discovered what and when even though the task seemed straightforward many historians found it difficult and doubted whether these were the right kinds of questions to ask concerning science’s historical record the historiographic revolution in the study of science changed the sorts of questions historians asked by revising the underlying assumptions concerning the approach to reading the historical record rather than reading history backwards and imposing current ideas and values on the past texts are read within their historical context thereby maintaining their integrity the historiographic revolution also had implications for how to analyze and understand science philosophically the goal of structure declared kuhn was to cash out those implications the structure of scientific development according to kuhn may be illustrated schematically as follows preparadigm science → normal science → extraordinary science → new normal science the step from preparadigm science to normal science involves consensus of the community around a single paradigm where no prior consensus existed this is the step required for transitioning from immature to mature science the step from normal science to extraordinary science includes the community’s recognition that the reigning paradigm is unable to account for accumulating anomalies a crisis ensues and community practitioners engage in extraordinary science to resolve its anomalies a scientific revolution occurs with crisis resolution once a community selects a new paradigm it discards the old one and another period of new normal science follows the revolution or paradigm shift is now complete and the cycle from normal science to new normal science through revolution is free to occur again for kuhn the origin of a scientific discipline begins with the identification of a natural phenomenon which members of the discipline investigate experimentally and attempt to explain theoretically but each member of that nascent discipline is at crosspurposes with other members for each member often represents a school working from different foundations scientists operating under these conditions share few if any theoretical concepts experimental techniques or phenomenal entities rather each school is in competition for monetary and social resources and for the allegiance of the professional guild an outcome of this lack of consensus is that all facts seem equally relevant to the problems at hand and fact gathering itself is often a random activity there is then a proliferation of facts and hence little progress in solving the problems under these conditions kuhn called this state preparadigm or immature science which is nondirected and flexible providing a community of practitioners little guidance to achieve the status of a science a discipline must reach consensus with respect to a single paradigm this is realized when during the competition involved in preparadigm science one school makes a stunning achievement that catches the professional community’s attention the candidate paradigm elicits the community’s confidence that the problems are solvable with precision and in detail the community’s confidence in a paradigm to guide research is the basis for the conversion of its members who now commit to it after paradigm consensus kuhn claimed that scientists are in the position to commence with the practice of normal science the prerequisite of normal science then includes a commitment to a shared paradigm that defines the rules and standards by which to practice science whereas preparadigm science is nondirected and flexible normal or paradigm science is highly directed and rigid because of its directedness and rigidity normal scientists are able to make the progress they do the paradigm concept loomed large in kuhn’s new image of science he defined the concept in terms of the community’s concrete achievements such as newtonian mechanics which the professional can commonly recognize but cannot fully describe or explain a paradigm is certainly not just a set of rules or algorithms by which scientists blindly practice their trade in fact there is no easy way to abstract a paradigm’s essence or to define its features exhaustively moreover a paradigm defines a family resemblance à la wittgenstein of problems and procedures for solving problems that are part of a single research tradition although scientists rely at times on rules to guide research these rules do not precede paradigms importantly kuhn was not claiming that rules are unnecessary for guiding research but rather that they are not always sufficient either pedagogically or professionally kuhn compared the paradigm concept to polanyi’s notion of tacit knowledge in which knowledge production depends on the investigator’s acquisition of skills that do not reduce to methodological rules and protocols as noted above newtonian mechanics represents an example of a kuhnian paradigm the three laws of motion comprising it provided the scientific community with the resources to investigate natural phenomena in terms of both precision and predictability in terms of precision newtonian mechanics allowed physicists to measure and explain accurately—with clockwork exactitude—the motion not only of celestial but also terrestrial bodies with respect to prediction physicists used the newtonian paradigm to determine the potential movement of heavenly and earthly bodies thus newtonian mechanics qua paradigm equipped physicists with the ability to explain and manipulate natural phenomena in sum it became a way of viewing the world according to kuhn a paradigm allows scientists to ignore concerns over a discipline’s fundamentals and to concentrate on solving its puzzles—as the newtonian paradigm permitted physicists to do for several centuries it not only guides scientists in terms of identifying soluble puzzles but it also prevents scientists from tackling insoluble ones kuhn compared paradigms to maps that guide and direct the community’s investigations only when a paradigm guides the community’s activities is scientific advancement as cumulative progress possible the activity of practitioners engaged in normal science is paradigm articulation and extension to new areas indeed the newtonian paradigm was adapted even for medicine when a new paradigm is established it solves only a few critical problems that faced the community but it does offer the promise for solving many more problems much of normal science involves mopping up in which the community forces nature into a conceptually rigid framework—the paradigm rather than being dull and routine however such activity according to kuhn is exciting and rewarding and requires practitioners who are creative and resourceful normal scientists are not out to make new discoveries or to invent new theories outside the paradigm’s aegis rather they are involved in using the paradigm to understand nature precisely and in detail from the experimental end of this task normal scientists go to great pains to increase the precision and reliability of their measurements and facts they are also involved in closing the gap between observations and theoretical predictions and they attempt to clarify ambiguities left over from the paradigm’s initial adoption they also strive to extend the scope of the paradigm by including phenomena not heretofore investigated much of this activity requires exploratory investigation in which normal scientists make novel discoveries but anticipated visàvis the paradigm to solve these experimental puzzles often requires considerable technological ingenuity and innovation on the part of the scientific community as kuhn notes atwood’s machine—developed almost a century after newton is a good illustration of this besides experimental puzzles there are also the theoretical puzzles of normal science which obviously mirror the types of experimental puzzles normal scientists conduct theoretical analyses to enhance the match between theoretical predictions and experimental observations especially in terms of increasing the paradigm’s precision and scope again just as experimental ingenuity is required so is theoretical ingenuity to explain natural phenomena successfully normal science according to kuhn is puzzlesolving activity and its practitioners are puzzle solvers and not paradigm testers the paradigm’s power over a community of practitioners is that it can transform seemingly insoluble problems into soluble ones through the practitioner’s ingenuity and skill besides the assured solution kuhn’s paradigm concept also involved rules of the puzzlesolving game not in a narrow sense of algorithms but in a broad sense of viewpoints or preconceptions besides these rules of the game as it were there are also metaphysical commitments which inform the community as to the types of natural entities and methodological commitments which inform the community as to kinds of laws and explanations although rules are often necessary for normal scientific research they are not always required normal science can proceed in the absence of such rules although scientists engaged in normal science do not intentionally attempt to make unexpected discoveries such discoveries do occur paradigms are imperfect and rifts in the match between paradigm and nature are inevitable for kuhn discoveries not only occur in terms of new facts but there is also invention in terms of novel theories both discoveries of new facts and invention of novel theories begin with anomalies which are violations of paradigm expectations during the practice of normal science anomalies can lead to unexpected discoveries for kuhn unexpected discoveries involve complex processes that include the intertwining of both new facts and novel theories facts and theories go handinhand for such discoveries cannot be made by simple inspection because discoveries depend upon the intertwining of observations and theories the discovery process takes time for the conceptual integration of the novel with the known moreover that process is complicated by the fact that novelties are often resisted due to prior expectations because of allegiance to a paradigm scientists are loathed to abandon it simply because of an anomaly or even several anomalies in other words anomalies are generally not counterinstances that falsify a paradigm just as anomalies are critical for discovery of new facts or phenomena so they are essential for the invention of novel theories although facts and theories are intertwined the emergence of novel theories is the outcome of a crisis the crisis is the result of the paradigm’s breakdown or inability to provide solutions to its anomalies the community then begins to harbor questions about the ability of the paradigm to guide research which has a profound impact upon it the chief characteristic of a crisis is the proliferation of theories as members of a community in crisis attempt to resolve its anomalies they offer more and varied theories interestingly anomalies that are responsible for the crisis may not necessarily be new since they may have been present all along this helps to explain why anomalies lead to a period of crisis in the first place the paradigm promised resolution of them but was unable to fulfill its promise the overall effect is a return to a situation very similar to preparadigm science closure of a crisis occurs in one of three possible ways according to kuhn first on occasion that the paradigm is sufficiently robust to resolve anomalies and to restore normal science practice second even the most radical methods are unable to revolve the anomalies under these circumstances the community tables them until future investigation and analysis third the crisis is resolved with the replacement of the old paradigm by a new one but only after a period of extraordinary science kuhn stressed that the initial response of a community in crisis is not to abandon its paradigm rather its members make every effort to salvage it through ad hoc modifications until the anomalies can be resolved either theoretically or experimentally the reason for this strong allegiance claimed kuhn is that a community must first have an alternative candidate to take the original paradigm’s place for science at least normal science is possible only with a paradigm and to reject it without a substitute is to reject science itself which reflects poorly on the community and not on the paradigm moreover a community does not reject a paradigm simply because of a fissure in the paradigmnature fit kuhn’s aim was to reject a naïve popperian falsificationism in which single counterinstances are sufficient to reject a theory in fact he reversed the tables and contended that counterinstances are essential for the practice of vibrant normal science although the goal of normal science is not necessarily to generate counterinstances normal science practice does provide the occasion for their possible occurrence normal science then serves as an opportunity for scientific revolutions if there are no counterinstances reasoned kuhn scientific development comes to a halt the transition from normal science through crisis to extraordinary science involves two key events first the paradigm’s boundaries become blurred when faced with recalcitrant anomalies and second its rules are relaxed leading to proliferation of theories and ultimately to the emergence of a new paradigm often relaxing the rules allows practitioners to see exactly where the problem is and how to solve it this state has tremendous impact upon a community’s practitioners similar to that during preparadigm science extraordinary scientists according to kuhn behave erratically—because scientists are trained under a paradigm to be puzzlesolvers not paradigmtesters in other words they are not trained to do extraordinary science and must learn as they go for kuhn this type of behavior is more open to psychological than logical analysis moreover during periods of extraordinary science practitioners may even examine the discipline’s philosophical foundations to that end they analyze their assumptions in order to loosen the old paradigm’s grip on the community and to suggest alternative approaches to the generation of a new paradigm although the process of extraordinary science is convoluted and complex a replacement paradigm may emerge suddenly often the source of its inspiration is rooted in the practice of extraordinary science itself in terms of the interconnections among various anomalies finally whereas normal science is a cumulative process adding one paradigm achievement to the next extraordinary science is not rather it is like—using herbert butterfield’s analogy—grabbing hold of a stick’s other end that other end of the stick is a scientific revolution the transition from extraordinary science to a new normal science represents a scientific revolution according to kuhn a scientific revolution is noncumulative in which a newer paradigm replaces an older one—either partially or completely it can come in two sizes a major revolution such as the shift from geocentric universe to heliocentric universe or a minor revolution such as the discovery of xrays or oxygen but whether big or small all revolutions have the same structure generation of a crisis through irresolvable anomalies and establishment of a new paradigm that resolves the crisisproducing anomalies because of the extreme positions taken by participants in a revolution opposing camps often become galvanized in their positions and communication between them breaks down and discourse fails the ultimate source for the establishment of a new paradigm during a crisis is community consensus that is when enough community members are convinced by persuasion and not simply by empirical evidence or logical analysis moreover to accept the new paradigm community practitioners must be assured that there is no chance for the old paradigm to solve its anomalies persuasion loomed large in kuhn’s scientific revolutions because the new paradigm solves the anomalies the old paradigm could not thus the two paradigms are radically different from each other often with little overlap between them for kuhn a community can only accept the new paradigm if it considers the old one wrong the radical difference between old and new paradigms such that the old cannot be derived from the new is the basis of the incommensurability thesis in essence there is no common measure or standard for the two paradigms this is evident claimed kuhn when looking at the meaning of theoretical terms although the terms from an older paradigm can be compared to those of a newer one the older terms must be transformed with respect to the newer ones but there is a serious problem with restating the old paradigm in transformed terms the older transformed paradigm may have some utility for example pedagogically but a community cannot use it to guide its research like a fossil it reminds the community of its history but it can no longer direct its future the establishment of a new paradigm resolves a scientific revolution and issues forth a new period of normal science with its establishment kuhn’s new image of a mature science comes full circle only after a period on intense competition among rival paradigms does the community choose a new paradigm and scientists once again become puzzlesolvers rather than paradigmtesters the resolution of a scientific revolution is not a straightforward process that depends only upon reason or evidence part of the problem is that proponents of competing paradigms cannot agree on the relevant evidence or proof or even on the relevant anomalies that require resolution since their paradigms are incommensurable another factor that leads to difficulties in resolving scientific revolutions is that communication among members in crisis is only partial this results from the new paradigm borrowing from the old paradigm theoretical terms and concepts and laboratory protocols although they share borrowed vocabulary and technology the new paradigm gives new meaning and uses to them the net result is that members of competing paradigms talk past one another moreover the change in paradigms is not a gradual process in which different parts of the paradigm are changed piecemeal rather the change must be as a whole and suddenly convincing scientists to make such a wholesale transformation takes time how then does one segment of the community convince or persuade another to switch paradigms for members who worked for decades under the old paradigm they may never accept the new paradigm rather it is often the younger members who accept the new paradigm through something like a religious conversion according to kuhn faith is the basis for conversion especially faith in the potential of the new paradigm to solve future puzzles by invoking the terms conversion and faith kuhn was not implying that arguments and reason are unimportant in a paradigm shift indeed the most common reason for accepting a new paradigm is that it solves the anomalies the old paradigm could not however kuhn point was that argument and reason alone are insufficient aesthetic or subjective factors also play an important role in a paradigm shift since the new paradigm solves only a few but critical anomalies these factors weigh heavily in the shift initially by reassuring community members that the new paradigm represents the discipline’s future from the resolution of revolutions kuhn made several important philosophical points concerning the principles of verification and falsification as kuhn acknowledged philosophers no longer search for absolute verification since no theory can be tested exhaustively rather they calculate the probability of a theory’s verification according to probabilistic verification every imaginable theory must be compared with one another visàvis the available data the problem in terms of kuhn’s new image of science is that a theory is tested with respect to a given paradigm and such a restriction precludes access to every imaginable theory moreover kuhn rejected falsifying instances because no paradigm resolves every problem facing a community under these conditions no paradigm would ever be accepted for kuhn the process of verification and falsification must include imprecision associated with theoryfact fit an interesting feature of scientific revolutions according to kuhn is their invisibility what he meant by this is that in the process of writing textbooks popular scientific essays and even philosophy of science the path to the current paradigm is sanitized to make it appear as if it was in some sense born mature disguising a paradigm’s history is an outcome of a belief about scientific knowledge which considers it as invariable and its accumulation as linear this disguising serves the winner of the crisis by establishing its authority especially as a pedagogical aid for indoctrinating students into a community of practitioners another important effect of a revolution related to a paradigm shift is a shift in the community’s image of science the change in science’s image should be no surprise since the prevailing paradigm defines science change that paradigm and science itself changes at least how to practice it in other words the shift in science’s image is a result of a change in the community’s standards for what constitutes its puzzles and its puzzles’ solutions finally revolutions transform scientists from practitioners of normal science who are puzzlesolvers to practitioners of extraordinary science who are paradigmtesters besides transforming science revolutions also transform the world that scientists inhabit and investigate one of the major impacts of a scientific revolution is a change of the world in which scientists practice their trade kuhn’s worldchanges thesis as it has become known is certainly one of his most radical and controversial ideas besides the associated incommensurability thesis the issue is how far ontologically does the change go or is it simply an epistemological ploy to reinforce the comprehensive effects of scientific revolutions in other words does the world really change or simply the worldview that is one’s perspective on or perception of the world for kuhn the answer relied not on a logical or even a philosophical but rather a psychological analysis of the change kuhn analyzed the changes in worldview by analogizing it to a gestalt switch for example duckrabbit although the gestalt analogy is suggestive it is limited to only perceptual changes and says little about the role of previous experience in such transformations previous experience is important because it influences what a scientist sees when making an observation moreover with a gestalt switch the person can stand above or outside of it acknowledging with certainty that one sees now a duck or now a rabbit such an independent perspective which eventually is an authoritarian stance is not available to the community of practitioners there is no answer sheet as it were because the community’s access to the world is limited by what it can observe any change in what is observed has important consequences for the nature of what is observed that is the change has ontological significance thus for kuhn the change revolution brings about is more than simply seeing or observing a different world it also involves working in a different world the perceptual transformation is more than reinterpretation of data for data are not stable but they too change during a paradigm shift data interpretation is a function of normal science while data transformation is a function of extraordinary science that transformation is often a result of intuitions moreover besides a change in data revolutions change the relationships among data although traditional western philosophy has searched for three centuries for stable theoryneutral data or observations to justify theories that search has been in vain sensory experience occurs through a paradigm of some sort argued kuhn even articulations of that experience hence no one can step outside a paradigm to make an observation it is simply impossible given the limits of human physiology kuhn then took on the nature of scientific progress for normal science progress is cumulative in that the solutions to puzzles form a repository of information and knowledge about the world this progress is the result of the direction a paradigm provides a community of practitioners importantly the progress achieved through normal science in terms of the information and knowledge is used to educate the next generation of scientists and to manipulate the world for human welfare scientific revolutions change all that for kuhn revolutionary progress is not cumulative but noncumulative what then does a community of practitioners gain by going through a revolution or paradigm shift has it made any kind of progress in its rejection of a previous paradigm and the fruit that paradigm yielded of course the victors of the revolution are going to claim that progress was made after the revolution to do otherwise would be to admit that they were wrong rather advocates of the new normal science are going to do everything they can to ensure that their winning paradigm is seen as pushing forward a better understanding of the world the progress achieved through a revolution is twofold according to kuhn the first is the successful solution of anomalies that a previous paradigm could not solve the second is the promise to solve additional problems or puzzles that arise from these anomalies but has the community gotten closer to the truth that is the notion of verisimilitude by going through a revolution according to kuhn the answer is no for kuhn progress in science is not directed activity towards some goal like truth rather scientific progress is evolutionary just as natural selection operates during biological evolution in the emergence of a new species so community selection during a scientific revolution functions similarly in the emergence of a new theory and just as species are adapted to their environments so theories are adapted to the world kuhn had no answer to the question why this should be other than the world and the community that investigates it exhibit unique features what these features are kuhn did not know but he concluded that the new image of science he had proposed would resolve like a new paradigm after a scientific revolution these problems he invited the next generation of philosophers of science to join him in a new philosophy of science incommensurate with its predecessor the reaction to kuhn’s structure was at first congenial especially by historians of science but within a few years it turned critical particularly by philosophers critics charged him with irrationalism and epistemic relativism although he felt the reviews of structure were good his chief concerns were the tags of irrationalism and relativism—at least a pernicious kind of relativism kuhn believed the charges were inaccurate however simply because he maintained that science does not progress toward a predetermined goal but like evolutionary change one theory replaces another with a better fit between theory and nature visàvis competitors moreover he believed that use of the darwinian evolution was the correct framework for discussing science’s progress but he felt no one took it seriously on  july  kuhn participated in an international colloquium in the philosophy of science held at bedford college in london the colloquium was organized jointly by the british society for the philosophy of science and by the london school of economics and political science kuhn delivered the initial paper comparing his and karl popper’s conceptions of the growth of scientific knowledge john watkins then delivered a paper criticizing kuhn’s notion of normal science with popper chairing the session popper also presented a paper criticizing kuhn as did several other members of the philosophy of science community including stephen toulmin l pearce williams and margaret masterman who identified twentyone senses of kuhn’s use of paradigm in structure masterman concluded her paper inviting others to join in clarifying kuhn’s paradigm concept kuhn himself took up masterman’s challenge and clarified the paradigm concept in the second edition of structure particularly in its ‘postscript—’ to that end he divided paradigm into disciplinary matrix and exemplars the former represents the milieu of the professional practice consisting of symbolic generalizations models and values while the latter represents solutions to concrete problems that a community accepts as paradigmatic in other words exemplars serve as templates for solving problems or puzzles facing the scientific community and thereby for advancing the community’s scientific knowledge for kuhn scientific knowledge is not localized simply within theories and rules rather it is localized within exemplars the basis for an exemplar to function in puzzle solving is the scientist’s ability to see the similarity between a previously solved puzzle and a currently unsolved one in the early sixties van vleck invited kuhn to direct a project collecting materials on the history of quantum mechanics in august  hunter dupree charles kittel kuhn john wheeler and harry wolff met in berkeley to discuss the project’s organization wheeler next met with richard shryock and a joint committee of the american physical society and the american philosophical society on the history of theoretical physics in the twentieth century was formed to sponsor and develop the project the project lasted for three years with the first and last years of the project conducted in berkeley and the middle year in europe the national science foundation funded the project the project led to a publication by john heilbron and kuhn on the origins of the bohr atom they provided a revisionist narrative of bohr’s path to the quantized atom beginning with his  doctoral dissertation and concluding with his  threepart paper on atomic structure the intrigue of this historical study was that within a sixweek period in mid bohr went from little interest in models of the atom to producing a quantized model of jj rutherford’s atom and applying that model to several perplexing problems the authors explored bohr’s sudden interest in atomic models they proposed that his interest stemmed from specific problems which guided bohr in terms of both his reading and research toward the potential of the atomic structure for solving them the solutions to those problems resulted from what heilbron and kuhn called a  february transformation in bohr’s research what initiated the transformation claimed the authors was that bohr had read a few months earlier jw nicholson’s papers on the application of max planck’s constant to generate an atomic model although nicholson’s model was incorrect it led bohr in the right direction then in february  bohr in a conversation with hr hansen obtained the last piece of the puzzle after the transformation bohr completed the atomic model project within the year besides completing a draft of structure in  kuhn was made full professor at berkeley but only in the history department members of philosophy department voted to deny him promotion in their department a denial that angered and hurt kuhn tremendously princeton university made kuhn an offer to join its faculty while he was in europe the university had recently inaugurated a history and philosophy of science program the program’s chair was charles gillispie and its staff included john murdoch hilary putnam and carl hempel upon returning to the united states in  kuhn visited princeton he decided to accept the offer and joined its faculty in  he became the program’s director in  and the following year princeton appointed him the moses taylor pyne professor of history as the sixties ended structure was becoming increasingly popular especially among student radicals who believed it liberated them from the tyranny of tradition  the road after structure in  kuhn moved to mit’s department of linguistics and philosophy in  he was appointed the laurance s rockefeller professor of philosophy at mit he took a linguistic turn in his thinking reflecting his new environment which had a major impact on his subsequent work especially on the incommensurability thesis structure’s success not only established the historiographic revolution in the study of science in either historically or philosophically or what came to be called the discipline of history and philosophy of science but also supported the rise of science studies in general and specifically the sociology and anthropology of science particularly the sociology of scientific knowledge kuhn rejected both these trajectories often attributed to structure for what he called historical philosophy of science he conducted—as he categorized his work in the essential tension—either historical studies on science or their historiographic implications or either metahistorical studies or their philosophical implications in other words his scholarly work was either historical or philosophical a historical and historiographic studies kuhn’s final major historical study was on planck’s blackbody radiation theory and the origins of quantum discontinuity the transition from classical physics—in which particles pass through intermediate energy stages—to quantum physics—in which energy change is discontinuous—is traditionally attributed to planck’s  and  quantum papers according to kuhn this traditional account was inaccurate and the transition was initiated by albert einstein’s and paul ehrenfest’s independent  quantum papers kuhn’s realization of this inaccuracy was similar to the enlightenment he experienced when struggling to make sense of aristotle’s notion of mechanical motion his initial epiphany occurred while reading planck’s  paper on blackbody radiation through that experience he realized that planck’s  and  quantum papers were not the initiation of a new theory of quantum discontinuity but rather they represented planck’s effort to derive the blackbody distribution law based on classical statistical mechanics kuhn concluded the study with an analysis of planck’s second blackbody theory first published in  in which planck used the notion of discontinuity to derive the second theory rather than the traditional position which claimed the second theory represents a regression on planck’s part to classical physics kuhn argued that it represents the first time planck incorporated into his theoretical work a theory in which he was not completely confident in the blackbody radiation and quantum discontinuity historical study kuhn did not use paradigm normal science anomaly crisis or incommensurability which he championed in structure critics especially within the history and philosophy of science discipline were disappointed kuhn bemoaned the book’s reception even by its supporters however he later explored the historiographic and philosophical issues raised in blackbody theory with respect to structure the historiographic issues that the former book addressed were the same raised in the  monograph specifically he claimed that current historiography should attempt to understand previous scientific texts in terms of their contemporary context and not in terms of modern science kuhn’s concern was more than historical accuracy rather he was interested in recapturing the thought processes that lead to a change in theory although structure was kuhn’s articulation of this process for scientific change the terminology in the monograph did not represent a straightjacket for narrating history for kuhn the terminology and vocabulary like paradigm and normal science used in structure were not products such as metaphysical categories to which a historical narrative must conform rather they had a different metaphysical function—as presuppositions towards an historical narrative as process in other words structure’s terminology and vocabulary were tools by which to reconstruct a scientific historical narrative and not a template for articulating it the purpose of history of science according to kuhn was not just getting the facts straight but providing philosophers of science with an accurate image of science to practice their trade kuhn fervently believed that the new historiography of science would prevent philosophers from engaging in the excesses and distortions prevalent within traditional philosophy of science he envisioned history of science informing philosophy of science as historical philosophy of science rather than history and philosophy of science since the relationship was asymmetrical prior to  history of science was a discipline practiced mostly by eminent scientists who generally wrote heroic biographies or sweeping overviews of a discipline often for pedagogical purposes within the past generation historians of science such as alexander koyré anneliese maier and ej dijsterhuis developed an approach to the history of science that was simply more than chronicling science’s theoretical and technical achievements an important factor in that development was the recognition of institutional and sociological factors in the practice of science a consequence of this historiographic revolution was the distinction between internal and external histories of science internal history of science is concerned with the development of the theories and methods employed by scientists in other words it studies the history of events people and ideas internal to scientific advancement the historian as internalist attempts to climb inside the mind of scientists as they push forward the boundaries of their discipline external history of science concentrates on the social and cultural factors that impinge on the practice of science for kuhn the distinction between internal and external histories of science mapped onto his pattern of scientific development external or cultural and social factors are important during a scientific discipline’s initial establishment however once established those factors no longer have a major impact on a community’s practice or its generation of scientific knowledge they can have a minor impact on a mature science’s practice such as the timing of technological innovation importantly for kuhn internal and external approaches to the history of science are not necessarily mutually exclusive but complementary b metahistorical studies as mentioned already kuhn considered himself a practitioner of both the history of science and the philosophy of science and not the history and philosophy of science for a very practical reason crassly put the goal for history is the particular while for philosophy the universal kuhn compared the differences between the two disciplines to a duckrabbit gestalt switch in other words the two disciplines are so fundamentally different in terms of their goals that the resulting images of science are incommensurable moreover to see the other discipline’s image requires a conversion for kuhn then the history of science and the philosophy of science cannot be practiced at the same time but only alternatively and then with difficulty how then can the history of science be of use to philosophers of science the answer for kuhn was by providing an accurate image of science rejecting the covering law model for historical explanation because it reduces historians to mere social scientists kuhn advocated an image based on ordering of historical facts into a narrative analogous to the one he proposed for puzzle solving under the aegis of a paradigm in the physical sciences historians of science as they narrate change in science provide an image of science that reflects the process by which scientific information develops rather than the image provided by traditional philosophers of science in which scientific knowledge is simply a product of logical verification or falsification kuhn insisted that the history of science and the philosophy of science remain distinct disciplines so that historians of science can provide an image of science to correct the distortion produced by traditional philosophers of science according to kuhn the social history of science also distorts the image of science for social historians scientists construct rather than discover scientific knowledge although kuhn was sympathetic to this type of history he believed it created a gap between older constructions and the ones replacing them which he challenged historians of science to fill besides social historians of science kuhn also accused sociologists of science for distorting the image of science although kuhn acknowledged that factors such as interests power authority among others are important in the production of scientific knowledge the predominant use of them by sociologists eclipses other factors such as nature itself the key to rectifying the distortion introduced by sociologists is to shift from a rationality of belief that is the reasons scientists hold specific beliefs to a rationality of change in beliefs that is the reasons scientists change their beliefs for kuhn a historical philosophy of science was the means for correcting these distortions of the scientific image kuhn’s historical philosophy of science focused on the metahistorical issues derived from historical research particularly scientific development and the related issues of theory choice and incommensurability importantly for kuhn both theory choice and incommensurability are intimately linked to one another the former cannot be reduced to an algorithm of objective rules but requires subjective values because of the latter kuhn explored scientific development using three different approaches the first was in terms of problem versus puzzle solving according to kuhn problems have no ready solution and problem solving is often generally pragmatic and is the hallmark of an underdeveloped or immature science puzzles on the other hand occupy the attention of scientists involved in a developed or mature science although they have guaranteed solutions the methods for solving puzzles are not assured scientists who solve them demonstrate their ingenuity and are rewarded by the community with this distinction in mind kuhn envisioned scientific development as the transition of a scientific discipline from an underdeveloped problemsolving state to a developed puzzlesolving one the question then arises as to how this occurs the answer that many took from structure was adopt a paradigm however kuhn found this answer to be incorrect in that paradigms are not unique only to the sciences but does articulating the question in terms of puzzlesolving help kuhn’s answer was pragmatic that is keep trying different solutions until one works in other words philosophers of science had no exemplars by which to solve their problems kuhn’s second approach to scientific development was in terms of the growth of knowledge he proposed an alternative view to the traditional one that scientific knowledge grows by a piecemeal accumulation of facts to shed light on the alternative view kuhn offered a different reconstruction of science the central ideas of a science cohere with one another forming a set of the central ideas or core of a particular science besides the core a periphery exists which represents an area where scientists can investigate problems associated with a research tradition without changing core ideas kuhn then drew parallels between the current reconstruction of science and the earlier one in structure obviously the transition in cores from one research tradition to another is a scientific revolution moreover the core represents a paradigm that defines a particular research tradition finally the periphery is identified with normal science the core then provides the means by which to practice science and to change the core requires significant retooling that practitioners naturally resist is this change in the core a growth of knowledge to answer the question kuhn examined the standard account of knowledge as justified true belief what he found problematic with the account is the amount or nature of the evidence needed to justify a belief and this of course raises the issue of truth for which he had no ready solution ultimately kuhn equivocated on the question of the growth of knowledge kuhn’s final approach to scientific development was through the analysis of three scientific revolutions the shift from aristotelian to newtonian physics volta’s discovery of the electric cell and planck’s blackbody radiation research and quantum discontinuity from these examples kuhn derived three characteristics of scientific revolutions the first was holistic in that scientific revolutions are allornone events the second was the way referents change after revolutions especially in terms of taxonomic categories according to kuhn revolutions redistribute objects among these categories the final characteristic of scientific revolutions was a change in a discipline’s analogy metaphor or model which represents the connection between taxonomic categories and the world’s structure according to traditional philosophers of science the objective features of a good scientific theory include accuracy consistency scope simplicity and fecundity however these features when used individually as criteria for theory choice argued kuhn are imprecise and often conflict with one another although necessary for theory choice they are insufficient and must include the characteristics of the scientists making the choices these characteristics involve personal experiences or biography and personality or psychological traits in other words not only does theory choice rely on a theory’s objective features but also on individual scientists’ subjective characteristics why have traditional philosophers of science ignored or neglected subjective factors in theory choice part of the answer is that they confined the subjective to the context of discovery while restricting the objective to the context of justification kuhn insisted that this distinction does not fit with observations of scientific practice it is artificial reflecting science pedagogy but actual scientific practice reveals that textbook presentations of theory choice are stylized to convince students who rely on the authority of their instructors what else can students do textbook science discloses only the product of science not its process for kuhn since subjective factors are present at the discovery phase of science they should also be present at the justification phase according to kuhn objective criteria function as values which do not dictate theory choice but rather influence it values help to explain scientists’ behavior which for the traditional philosopher of science may at times appear irrational most importantly values account for disagreement over theories and help to distribute risk during debates over theories kuhn’s position had important consequences for the philosophy of science he maintained that critics misinterpreted his position on theory choice as subjective for them the term denoted a matter of taste that is not rationally discussable but his use of the term did involve the discussable with respect to standards moreover kuhn denied that facts are theory independent and that there is strictly a rational choice to be made rather he contended scientists do not choose a theory based on objective criteria alone but are converted based on subjective values finally kuhn discussed theory choice with respect to the incommensurability thesis the question he entertained was what type of communication is possible among community members holding competing theories the answer according to kuhn is that communication is partial the answer raised a second and more important question for kuhn and his critics is good reason visàvis empirical evidence available to justify theory choice given such partial communication the answer would be straightforward if communication was complete but it is not for kuhn this situation meant that ultimately reasonable evaluation of the empirical evidence is not compelling for theory choice and of course raised the charge of irrationality which he denied kuhn identified two common misconceptions of his version of the incommensurability thesis the first was that since two incommensurable theories cannot be stated in a common language then they be cannot compared to one another in order to choose between them the second was that since an older theory cannot be translated into modern expression it cannot be articulated meaningfully kuhn addressed the first misconception by distinguishing between incommensurability as no common measure and as no common language he defined the incommensurability thesis in terms of the latter rather than the former most theoretical terms are homophonic and can have the same meaning in two competing theories however only a handful of terms are incommensurable or untranslatable kuhn considered this a modest version of the incommensurability thesis calling it local incommensurability and claimed that it was his originally intention although there may be no common language to compare terms that change their meaning during a scientific revolution there is a partially common language composed of the invariant terms that do permit some semblance of comparison thus kuhn argued the first criticism fails because and this was his main point an incommensurate residue remains even with a partially common language as for the second misconception kuhn claimed that critics conflate the difference between translation and interpretation the conflation is understandable since translation often involves interpretation translation for kuhn is the process by which words or phrases of one language substitute for another interpretation however involves attempts to make sense of a statement or to make it intelligible incommensurability then does not mean that a theoretical term cannot be interpreted that is cannot be made intelligible rather it means that the term cannot be translated that is there is no equivalent for the term in the competing theoretical language in other words in order for the theoretical term to have meaning the scientist must go native in its use kuhn introduced the notion of the lexicon and its attendant taxonomy to capture both a term’s reference and intention or sense in the lexicon there are referring terms that are interrelated to other referring terms that is the holistic principle the lexicon’s structure of interrelated terms resembles the world’s structure in terms of its taxonomic categories a particular scientific community uses its lexicon to describe and explain the world in terms of this taxonomy and members of a community or of different communities must share the same lexicon if they are to communicate fully with one another moreover claimed kuhn if full translation is to be achieved the two languages must share a similar structure with respect to their respective lexicons incommensurability then reflects lexicons that have different taxonomic structures by which the world is carved up and articulated kuhn also addressed a problem that involves communication among communities who hold incommensurable theories or who occupy positions across a historical divide kuhn noted that although lexicons can change dramatically this does not deter members from reconstructing their past in the current lexicon’s vocabulary such reconstruction obviously plays an important function in the community but the issue is that given the incommensurable nature of theories assessments of true and false or right and wrong are unwarranted for which critics charged kuhn with a relativist position—a position he was less inclined to deny the charge stemmed from the fact that kuhn advocated no privileged position from which to evaluate a theory rather evaluations must be made within the context of a particular lexicon and thus evaluations are relative to the relevant lexicon but kuhn found the charge of relativism trivial he acknowledged that his position on the relativity of truth and objectivity with respect to the community’s lexicon left him no option but to take literally world changes associated with lexical changes but is this an idealist position kuhn admitted that it appears to be but he claimed that it is an idealism like none other on the one hand the world is composed of the community’s lexicon but one the other hand preconceived ideas cannot mold it c evolutionary philosophy of science from the mids to earlys kuhn transitioned from historical philosophy of science and the paradigm concept to an evolutionary philosophy of science and the lexicon notion to that end he identified an alternative role for the incommensurability thesis with respect to segregating or isolating lexicons and their associated worlds from one another incommensurability now functioned for kuhn as a mechanism to isolate a community’s lexicon from another’s and as a means to underpin a notion of scientific progress as the proliferation of scientific specialties in other words as the taxonomical structure of the two lexicons become isolated and thereby incommensurable with one another according to kuhn a new specialty and its lexicon split off from the old or parent specialty and its lexicon this process accounts for a notion of scientific progress as an increase in the number of scientific specialties after a revolution scientific progress then is akin to biological speciation argued kuhn with incommensurability serving as the isolation mechanism the result is a treelike structure with increased specialization at the tips of the branches finally kuhn’s evolutionary philosophy of science is nonteleological in the sense that science progresses not towards an ultimate truth about the world but simply away from a lexicon that cannot be used to solve its anomalies to one that can however he still articulated incommensurability in terms of no common language with its attendant problems involving the notion of meaning and did not transform it fully with respect to an evolutionary philosophy of science kuhn was working out an evolutionary philosophy of science in a proposed book words and worlds an evolutionary view of scientific development he divided it into three parts with three chapters in each in the first part kuhn framed the problem associated with the incommensurability thesis and addressed the difficulties accessing past scientific achievements in the first chapter he presented an evolutionary view of scientific development without an archimedean platform to guide theory assessment kuhn proposed a comparative method for assessing theoretical changes the method forbids assessment of theories in isolation and methodological solecism in the next chapter he discussed the problems associated with examining past historical studies in science based on several historical cases he claimed that anomalies in older scientific texts could be understood only through an interpretative process involving an ethnographic or a hermeneutical reading he had now laid the groundwork for examining the incommensurability thesis in the third chapter kuhn discussed the changes of wordmeanings as changes in a taxonomy embedded in a lexicon—an apparatus of a language’s referring terms the result of these changes was an untranslatable gap between two incommensurable theories finally the lexical terms referring to objects change as the number of scientific specialties proliferate in the book’s second part kuhn continued to explore the nature of a community’s lexicon which he explicated in terms of taxonomic categories these categories are grouped as contrast sets and no overlap of categories exists within the same contrast set which kuhn called the nooverlap principle the principle prohibits the reference of terms to objects unless related to one another as species to genus moreover the properties of the categories are reflected in the properties of their names a term’s meaning then is a function of its taxonomic category and this restriction is the origin of untranslatability in the first chapter of this part kuhn discussed the nature of substances in terms of sortal predicates this move allowed kuhn to introduce plasticity into the lexicon’s usage moreover the differentiating set is not strictly conventional but relies on the world to which the different sets connect in the next chapter kuhn extended the lexicon notion to artifacts abstractions and theoretical entities in the final chapter of the second part kuhn specified the means by which community members acquire a lexicon first they must already possess a vocabulary about physical entities and forces next definitions play little if any role in learning new terms rather those terms are acquired through ostensive examples especially through problem solving and laboratory demonstrations third a single example is inadequate to learn the meaning of a term rather multiple examples are required next acquisition of a new term within a statement also requires acquisition of other new terms within that statement and lastly students can acquire the terms of a lexicon through different pedagogical routes in the book’s concluding part kuhn discussed what occurs during a change in the lexicon and the implications for scientific development in chapter seven he examined the means by which lexicons change and the repercussions such change has for communication among communities with different lexicons moreover he explored the role of arguments in lexical change in the subsequent chapter kuhn identified the type of progress achieved with changes in lexicons he maintained that progress is not the type that aims at a specific goal but rather is instrumental in the final chapter he broached the issues of relativism and realism not in traditional terms of truth and objectivity but rather with respect to the capability of making a statement statements from incommensurable theories that cannot be translated are ultimately ineffable they can be neither true nor false but their capability of being stated is relative to the community’s history in sum the book’s aim was certainly to address the philosophical issues left over from structure but more importantly it was to resolve the problems generated by a historical philosophy of science although others were also responsible for its creation kuhn assumed responsibility for resolving the problems and the sine qua non for resolving them was the incommensurability thesis for kuhn the thesis was required more than ever to defend rationality from the postmodern development of the strong program  conclusion in may  a conference—or as hempel called it a kuhnfest—was held in kuhn’s honor at mit sponsored by the sloan foundation and organized by paul horwich and judith thomson the conference speakers included jed buchwald nancy cartwright john earman michael friedman ian hacking john heilbron ernan mcmullin nm swerdlow and norton wise the papers reflected kuhn’s impact on the history and the philosophy of science hempel made a special appearance on the last day followed by kuhn’s remarks on the conference papers as he approached the podium after hempel’s remarks before a standingroomonly audience kuhn was visibly moved by the outpouring of professional appreciation for his contributions to a discipline that he cherished and from its members whom he truly respected kuhn retired from teaching in  and became an emeritus professor at mit during kuhn’s career he received numerous awards and accolades he was the recipient of honorary degrees from around a dozen academic institutions such as university of chicago columbia university university of padua and university of notre dame he was elected a member of the national academy of science—the most prestigious society for us scientists—and was an honorary life member of the new york academy of science and a corresponding fellow of the british academy he was president of the history of science society from  to  and the society awarded him its highest honor the sarton medal in  kuhn was also the recipient in  of the howard t behrman award for distinguished achievement in the humanities and in  of the
