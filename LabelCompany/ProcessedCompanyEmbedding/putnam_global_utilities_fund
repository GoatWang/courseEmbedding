developed markets in the utilities sector you cannot invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations the utilities industries may be affected by increases in fuel costs technological obsolescence changes in regulatory policies and deregulation the fund concentrates on a limited group of industries and is nondiversified because the fund may invest in fewer issuers it is vulnerable to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound the use of short selling may result in losses if the securities appreciate in value risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations stock prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions and factors related to a specific issuer or industry you can lose money by

developed markets in the utilities sector you cannot invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations the utilities industries may be affected by increases in fuel costs technological obsolescence changes in regulatory policies and deregulation the fund concentrates on a limited group of industries and is nondiversified because the fund may invest in fewer issuers it is vulnerable to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound the use of short selling may result in losses if the securities appreciate in value risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations stock prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions and factors related to a specific issuer or industry you can lose money by

developed markets in the utilities sector you cannot invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations the utilities industries may be affected by increases in fuel costs technological obsolescence changes in regulatory policies and deregulation the fund concentrates on a limited group of industries and is nondiversified because the fund may invest in fewer issuers it is vulnerable to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound the use of short selling may result in losses if the securities appreciate in value risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its

capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets in the utilities sector you cannot invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations the utilities industries may be affected by increases in fuel costs technological obsolescence changes in regulatory policies and deregulation the fund concentrates on a limited group of industries and is nondiversified because the fund may invest in fewer issuers it is vulnerable to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound the use of short selling may result in losses if the securities appreciate in value risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations stock prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general

of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other

categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the

understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category

performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high low this fund scores low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a

average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high high this funds expenses are rated as high because they are above the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the

to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound the use of short selling may result in losses if the securities appreciate in value risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations stock prices may
