preservative tubes are closed evacuated plastic tubes for the collection and the preservation of cellfree circulating dnacirculating tumor dna in human whole blood samples during storage and shipping using these tubes in combination with norgens plasmaserum cellfree circulating dna purification kits or norgens plasmaserum circulating dna purification kits slurry format enables the purification and concentration of an inhibitorfree cellfree circulating dnacirculating tumor dna in a very small elution volume that is compatible with any downstream application this product is for research use only and not for use in diagnostic procedures performance norgens cfdna preservative tubes abridge the collectionprocessing of whole blood for the subsequent purification of cellfree circulating dna the cfdna preservative tubes preserve and inhibit the programmed celldeath apoptosis of the blood hence preventing the release of intracellular dna into plasma see figure  moreover the cellfree circulating dnacirculating tumor dna levels are stable for up to  days at room temperature or up to  days at °c figure  and figure  whole blood samples can be shipped and stored at room temperature for the subsequent processing of plasma plasma samples produced from the whole blood sample collected into norgen’s cfdna preservative tubes and purified using norgens plasmaserum cellfree circulating dna purification kits or norgens plasmaserum circulating dna purification kits slurry format yield concentrated highquality and inhibitorfree cfdnactdna for any downstream application assays
