massachusetts  cato institute skip to main content research events publications commentary store support search form search this site legal briefs bulldog investors general partnership v massachusetts the massachusetts uniform securities act prohibits general solicitation and advertising by anyone offering unregistered securities ostensibly for the purpose of furthering state and federal disclosure schemes yet this ban on public communications has been applied so broadly that it has undermined those purported disclosure goals for instance the ban has prevented individuals who have no interest in investing in any security—such as journalists academics students and others who are not wealthy or financially sophisticated—from receiving truthful nonmisleading information about hedge funds in bulldog investors v massachusetts an investment company maintained an interactive website that provided information about its products because bulldog was not registered in massachusetts however the state filed an administrative action against the firm demanding it take down its online content in response bulldog joined a group of other firms and individuals—including some who have no interest in investing but wish to read the website information—in a lawsuit claiming that the massachusetts ban violates their first amendment rights the supreme judicial court of massachusetts upheld the ban so the plaintiffs have asked the us supreme court to take the case cato along with the competitive enterprise institute and a group of journalists and academics filed an amicus brief supporting that request and arguing that the massachusetts law is an unconstitutional ban on free speech we show that the state’s claim that the ban furthers a larger federal regulatory scheme ignores the judgment of many federal officials from both parties who have concluded that such bans undermine these goals the state’s alleged disclosure interest is just a pretext for coercing companies to register in massachusetts and is therefore an unconstitutional attempt at circumventing federal preemption but even if the ban furthers a legitimate state interest it is so broad that it is has substantially chilled both truthful nonmisleading commercial speech and noncommercial speech alike a law so repugnant to the first amendment cannot stand read the full legal brief pdf  kb tweet like submit plus

investors general partnership  others  v secretary of the commonwealth sjc     decided july   present marshall cj ireland spina cowin cordy  gants jjandrew good philip g cormier with him for the plaintiffs pierce o cray assistant attorney general peter w cassidy with him for the defendant a hearing officer in the securities division division of the office of the secretary of the commonwealth secretary found that the plaintiffs violated gl c a the massachusetts uniform securities act act by offering unregistered securities to a massachusetts resident via electronic mail email the plaintiffs sought judicial review of this ruling and a judge in the superior court affirmed the plaintiffs contend that their contacts with the commonwealth were insufficient to permit the secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over them that the act violates their constitutional right to free speech and that the communication did not constitute an offer within the meaning of the act we conclude that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consistent with due process that the constitutional claim is not properly before us and that the secretary determined correctly that the plaintiffs violated the act unlike at common law where the definition of an offer includes only communications to which an offerees affirmative response would conclude a bargain the act defines an “offer” more broadly to include the “solicitation of an offer” see gl c a §  i   thus the plaintiffs violated the act by sending to a massachusetts resident materials soliciting an offer to purchase unregistered securities facts and procedural history we summarize the facts found by the hearing officer supplemented with undisputed facts from the record from approximately june   through january   bulldog investors general partnership bulldog operated an interactive web site that provided information about investment products it offered for sale users could obtain more specific information about bulldogs “hedge funds” by registering with the siteon november   brendan hickey a massachusetts resident registered by providing bulldog with his name address telephone number and email address steven samuels a bulldog employee responded to hickeys registration with an email message to which documents were attached that contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs hedge funds the returns the funds had earned background information on bulldogs partners news articles about the funds and a description of the plaintiffs investment philosophy and strategy samuels also invited hickey to contact him by telephone to discuss bulldogs funds in greater detailon january   the secretary filed an administrative complaint against the plaintiffs alleging that bulldogs web site and email contact with hickey constituted an offer of securities that were neither registered nor exempt from registration in violation of the act see gl c a §  in their answer the plaintiffs denied violating the act and asserted as affirmative defenses  that the act and the secretarys regulations violated the plaintiffs right to free speech under the first amendment to the united states constitution and art  of the massachusetts declaration of rights and  that in any event the secretary lacked personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs the secretary appointed a hearing officer pursuant to  code mass regs § b the secretary moved for summary decision arguing that the hearing officer lacked the authority to decide the plaintiffs constitutional claims in response the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the superior court pursuant to  usc §  and gl c  § i asserting their constitutional claim regarding free speech the plaintiffs sought a stay of the administrative proceeding pending resolution of the first amendment claim in the superior court the hearing officer denied the request she stated that the only issue before her was whether the plaintiffs violated the act and that she was required to make a finding regarding liability before a court could decide whether there had been an abridgement of the plaintiffs first amendment right the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs had offered unregistered securities for sale in the commonwealth in addition she determined that the plaintiffs did not qualify for various exemptions to the registration requirement finally the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs were subject to personal jurisdiction in massachusetts because their violation of the act constituted a sufficient nexus to permit personal jurisdiction she recommended the issuance of a cease and desist order and a  finethe acting director of the division acting director adopted the hearing officers recommended findings of fact and rulings of law and imposed the recommended sanctions the plaintiffs sought judicial review of the acting directors determination in the superior court and moved for judgment on the pleadings see gl c a §  gl c a §  see also standing order  of the rules of the superior court  “a claim for judicial review shall be resolved through a motion for judgment on the pleadings ․” in a thoughtful memorandum of decision a judge in the superior court denied the motion and affirmed the acting directors ruling the judge concluded that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consonant with due process in addition she held that after having chosen to use the separate  usc §  action as the vehicle to obtain relief on their first amendment claim the plaintiffs could not raise that claim in the action pursuant to gl c a §  the plaintiffs appealed and we transferred the case from the appeals court on our own motion standard of review pursuant to gl c a §  “any person aggrieved by a final decision of the secretary in an adjudicatory proceeding may obtain judicial review” see gl c a §  we reverse the secretarys decision only if it was “a  in violation of constitutional provisions” “b  in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction” of the secretary “c  based upon an error of law” “d  made upon unlawful procedure” “e  unsupported by substantial evidence” “f  unwarranted by facts found by the court ․ where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact” or “g  arbitrary or capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law” see gl c a §  discussion the plaintiffs contend that the web site and the single email message to hickey were insufficient contacts with the commonwealth to subject them to personal jurisdiction before the secretary they claim that the act does not authorize the secretary to subject nonresidents to administrative enforcement proceedings furthermore they argue that exercising personal jurisdiction in this case violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution because the plaintiffs did not purposefully avail themselves of the benefits of massachusetts lawthe plaintiffs contend also that “the secretarys order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful nonmisleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction” in violation of the first amendment and art  they argue in addition that their web site and email message did not constitute an “offer” within the meaning of the act see gl c a §  i   they contend that the communication to hickey was not an offer because he could not have purchased securities merely by responding to the email message in addition they contend that hickey agreed to a disclaimer posted on the web site stating that the information contained therein did not constitute a solicitationthe secretary responds that the broad enforcement powers granted him under the act authorized personal jurisdiction in this case he argues also that his exercise of jurisdiction comported with due process because the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in massachusetts furthermore he contends that they could have reasonably anticipated being the subject of an enforcement proceeding by virtue of their violation of the act additionally the secretary contends that the plaintiffs first amendment claim is waived and that even if not waived the claim fails because there is no constitutional prohibition on requiring that a seller of securities disclose information about its products through registration before being allowed to offer or advertise them finally the secretary argues that the plaintiffs communication with hickey constituted a solicitation that falls within the acts definition of an offer he notes that the acts definition of the term “offer” is not limited to its commonlaw definitiona personal jurisdiction for a nonresident to be subject to personal jurisdiction in massachusetts there must be a statute authorizing jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction must be “consistent with basic due process requirements mandated by the united states constitution” intech inc v triple “c” marine salvage inc  mass    ned   quoting tatro v manor care inc  mass    ned   we analyze each requirement separatelyi statutory authorization of personal jurisdiction in court proceedings personal jurisdiction in massachusetts over a nonresident is authorized when one of the provisions of our longarm statute gl c a §  is satisfied see roberts v legendary marine sales  mass    ned   by its terms the longarm statute applies only to courts and cannot authorize an agency to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents see gl c a §  however the longarm statute is not the only source for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresidents the text and purposes of the act itself establish that it authorizes the secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents in an administrative proceedingthe act prohibits the offering or selling of unregistered securities in the commonwealth unless the securities are exempt from the registration requirement or are federal “covered” securities see gl c a §  the definition of “offer” includes not only offers that originate within the commonwealth but also ones directed into the commonwealth and received at the place to which they are directed see gl c a §  c  the secretary possesses the authority to conduct investigations inside or outside the commonwealth to determine if a violation has occurred see gl c a §  a  he also has broad authority to remedy “a violation of any provision” of the act by “any person” by imposing cease and desist orders or fines see gl c a § a a  these provisions establish that one of the purposes of the act is to protect massachusetts residents from offers and sales of unregistered securities directed at them from other jurisdictions these protections and the secretarys authority to conduct investigations outside the commonwealth would be meaningless without authorization to subject nonresidents to enforcement proceedingsfurthermore the act provides that where personal jurisdiction “cannot otherwise be obtained in the commonwealth” any nonresident who has violated the act is deemed to have appointed the secretary as his agent to receive process in any noncriminal proceeding arising out of that conduct see gl c a §  h  this authority to serve process would be ineffective in enforcing the act through administrative proceedings unless accompanied by the power to bring a respondent before a tribunal to adjudicate whether a violation occurred interpreting the statute to authorize service of process without authorizing personal jurisdiction would transform the substituted service provision into a nullity see flemings v contributory retirement appeal bd  mass    ned   “if a sensible construction is available we shall not construe a statute to make a nullity of pertinent provisions or to produce absurd results” ii due process “ ‘the constitutional touchstone’ of the determination whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process ‘remains whether the defendant established “minimum contacts” in the forum state’ ” tatro v manor care inc  mass    ned   quoting burger king corp v rudzewicz  us    sct   ledd   the due process analysis entails three requirements first minimum contacts must arise from some act by which the defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws” tatro v manor care inc supra quoting asahi metal indus co v superior court  us    sct   ledd   second the claim must arise out of or relate to the defendants contacts with the forum see tatro v manor care inc supra third “the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant must not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice’ ” tatro v manor care inc supra at   ned  quoting international shoe co v washington  us    sct   led  by contacting hickey the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business activities in massachusetts and invoked the protection of massachusetts law see tatro v manor care inc supra solicitation of business in massachusetts invokes benefits and protection of massachusetts law because the plaintiffs operated a web site accessible in massachusetts and sent a solicitation that is prohibited by massachusetts law to a massachusetts resident it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to anticipate being held responsible in massachusetts see worldwide volkswagen corp v woodson  us    “the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis ․ is whether the defendants conduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there”at the time of their communication with hickey the plaintiffs were on notice that hickey was a resident of massachusetts additionally the act placed the plaintiffs on notice that directing offers of unregistered securities into massachusetts is unlawful see gl c a §§   a  c  by soliciting purchases of their hedge funds the plaintiffs sought to derive commercial benefit from their interaction with hickey therefore it would be unfair “to escape having to account in massachusetts for consequences that arise proximately from such activities” burger king corp v rudzewicz supra at the plaintiffs suggest that we have ruled in prior cases that contacts more substantial than those existing here were insufficient to sustain personal jurisdiction see roberts v legendary marine sales inc  mass     ned   droukas v divers training academy inc  mass     ned   these cases are inapposite because they considered only whether personal jurisdiction was statutorily authorized by the longarm statute they did not address the due process questionthe second and third prongs of the due process analysis are also satisfied in this case it is undisputed that the secretarys enforcement proceedings arose out of the plaintiffs contacts with massachusetts finally exercising personal jurisdiction in these circumstances comports with fair play and substantial justice in determining whether fair play and substantial justice are satisfied we weigh the commonwealths interest in adjudicating the dispute the burden on the outofstate party of litigating in massachusetts and the commonwealths interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief see burger king corp v rudzewicz supra at  massachusetts has a strong interest in adjudicating violations of massachusetts securities law see tatro v manor care inc supra although there may be some inconvenience to the plaintiffs in litigating in massachusetts such inconvenience does not outweigh the commonwealths interest in enforcing its laws in a massachusetts forumthe plaintiffs contend that even if the secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over bulldog he could not exert personal jurisdiction over the individual plaintiffs the secretary has the burden of proving facts sufficient to establish that personal jurisdiction is permissible see miller v miller  mass    ned   because the facts in the record are sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over each individual plaintiff that burden has been met herein the administrative complaint the secretary alleged that hickey was sent advertising and offering materials through email in their answer to the administrative complaint each individual plaintiff admitted that he provided information via email to hickey while some of the individual plaintiffs later filed affidavits stating that they were not involved in sending this communication the secretary was entitled to credit the facts admitted in the answer rather than the affidavits see walker v georgetown housing auth  mass   n   ned   because each individual plaintiff admitted to facts sufficient to form a basis for personal jurisdiction the secretarys finding that he possessed personal jurisdiction over all the plaintiffs is supported by substantial evidence b first amendment claim the plaintiffs argue that “the secretarys order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful nonmisleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction” the secretary contends that the plaintiffs first amendment claim has been waived and that even if it has not been waived the cease and desist order and the act itself do not violate the constitutional protection of freedom of speechthe plaintiffs initially asserted their first amendment defense in their answer to the administrative complaint the hearing officer declined to rule on this issue instead she agreed that the constitutional defense should be decided by a court the hearing officer apparently viewed the constitutional claim as a challenge to the enabling statute and as such beyond the authority of the secretary to adjudicate see gurry v board of public accountancy  mass    ned  in response to the hearing officers position the plaintiffs litigated the first amendment issue in a separate action in the superior court in which they asserted violations of  usc §  the plaintiffs did not raise the first amendment issue in their complaint for judicial review in the instant case brought pursuant to gl c a §  they did plead the issue and litigate it in the  usc §  action in these unusual circumstances the  usc §  action is the proper forum for resolving the plaintiffs first amendment claimc violation of the act the secretary determined properly that the plaintiffs email message to hickey violated the act the act defines an offer to include the “solicitation of an offer” see gl c a §  i   thus as stated for the purposes of the act the term “offer” is not limited to its commonlaw definition the email message sent to hickey and the materials attached to it contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs hedge funds the returns the funds had earned background information on bulldogs partners news articles about the funds and a description of the plaintiffs investment philosophy and strategy it is clear that these materials were designed to stimulate interest in bulldogs funds thus the communication constituted a solicitation of an offer to buy unregistered securities see i  r mechanical inc v hazelton mfg co  massappct    ned   advertisements are usually considered requests for offers see also  williston contracts §  at  th edthe plaintiffs contend that because hickey would have needed to take additional steps before being permitted to purchase bulldogs securities the email communication cannot constitute an offer because in this context the term “offer” is not limited to its commonlaw definition see gl c a §  i   it is not required that the plaintiffs communication be such that hickeys assent would have concluded a bargain see note  supraadditionally the disclaimers posted on the web site do not defeat liability in order to access certain parts of the web site users are required to acknowledge disclaimers stating that the web site does not constitute a solicitation and the web site cannot be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation in any circumstances where such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful however the plaintiffs cannot escape liability for offering unregistered securities merely by stating to the users of their web site that their conduct does not constitute an offer the presence of a disclaimer asserting that the web site was not an offer or a solicitation is not dispositive the disclaimer is only one factor in determining whether the plaintiffs communication with hickey was an offer or a solicitation cf lemaitre v massachusetts turnpike auth  mass    ned   theos  sons inc v mack trucks inc  mass    ned   here as stated the materials sent to hickey were designed to stimulate interest in purchasing bulldogs securities most importantly the email message sent to hickey and the attachments therein did not contain the disclaimer that was posted on the web site for these reasons the email message sent to hickey was an offer within the meaning of the act conclusion the secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs and his determination that the plaintiffs violated the act was correct therefore the decision of the superior court affirming the issuance of the cease and desist order and the imposition of the fine was also correctjudgment affirmedcowin j findlaw career center attorney corporate counsel academic judicial clerk summer associate intern law librarian paralegal legal secretary

committing any further violations of the massachusetts act and to take all necessary actions to ensure that future offers and sales of securities complied with §  of the massachusetts act bulldog filed two actions challenging the administrative decision one action sought judicial review pursuant to gl c a §  claiming that bulldogs contacts with the commonwealth were insufficient to permit the

witness professor joseph a franco an expert on securities regulation in a carefully reasoned decision the judge concluded that the challenged statute regulations and enforcement action did not violate

urging congress to enact the legislation president franklin d roosevelt explained that while the government should not be in the business of guaranteeing the soundness of any particular security it

attending the issue shall be concealed from the buying public message from the president  regulation of security issues presented to the senate  cong rec  march   under the  act an issuer of

encompassing every attempt or offer to dispose of or solicitation of an offer to buy a security or interest in a security for value  usc § ba pursuant to the  act therefore offers are not limited to

express offer condition the public mind or arouse public interest in the particular securities matter of carl m loeb rhoades  co supra at  the  act however exempts certain securities and transactions from the registration requirement including transactions page  by an issuer not involving any public offering through what is known as the private offering exemption see  usc § d the meaning of this exemption has been developed through case law and sec guidance in securities  exch commn v ralston purina co supra at  the united states supreme court determined that the natural way to interpret the private offering exemption is in light of the statutory purpose and concluded that a private offering is an offer of securities to those who have no practical need for the registration statement because they have been shown to be able to fend for themselves in evaluating whether an offering is public or private the courts and the sec have considered the number of offerees their access to information the size or circumstances of the offering the sophistication of the offerees in financial matters and whether there is a preexisting relationship between the issuer and the offerees see eg

offer or sell the securities by any form of general solicitation or general advertising  cfr §§ c b  applying these principles in the context of internet web sites the sec has concluded that the use of a web site to offer or sell unregistered securities constitutes a general solicitation that disqualifies the offering as private unless the solicitation is contained in a passwordrestricted web

see st  c  §  see also g l c a §  massachusetts act shall be so construed as to effectuate its general purpose    to coordinate the interpretation and administration of this act with the related federal regulation the massachusetts act prohibits the offer or sale of securities in the commonwealth unless the securities are registered the security or transaction is exempt or the security is a federal covered security that is a security exempt from state regulation by imposition of federal law g l c a §  see  usc § r g l c a §  as under the  act an offer is not limited to the commonlaw

regs § be  massachusetts also exempts an offer of securities from registration in massachusetts where the offer is communicated through the internet is not directed specifically to any investors in the commonwealth and no unregistered nonexempt sales are made in the commonwealth  code mass regs § bm  note  iv discussion the plaintiffs argue that massachusetts securities laws that prevent bulldog from offering securities through general advertisements are overbroad and violate the first amendment applied to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment they specifically challenge the constitutionality of the regulations that prohibit general solicitation and advertising by anyone offering unregistered securities see  code mass regs § be § bl  cfr § c because  code mass regs § bl incorporates the prohibition against general solicitation and advertising of unregistered securities in rule c of the secs regulation d the plaintiffs claims implicitly challenge page  the constitutionality of this provision of federal regulation in short the plaintiffs contend that the injunctive relief and administrative sanctions issued against them must be vacated because they are constitutionally entitled to maintain their web site and communicate with any interested person such as bloness we first consider whether the challenged provisions of massachusetts securities law are constitutionally valid as applied to the communications at issue in this case and if having determined that they are valid proceed to the overbreadth challenge trustees of the state univ of ny v fox  us    fox  first amendment protection the secretary argues that we need not consider the first amendment questions because an issuers statements about its securities do not implicate the first amendment however we find no basis for any exception to the first amendment for speech that is restricted as part of the regulation of securities we recognize that the state does not lose its power to regulate commercial activity    whenever speech is a component of that activity and note that the supreme court has stated in dicta that the exchange of information about securities is speech that is regulated without offending the first amendment because it is a means of carrying out such commercial activity ohralik v ohio state bar assn  us    but we do not equate the communications at issue here with commercial conduct of which speech is merely an incidental part in bulldog i supra we concluded that viewed together the email to hickey and the presentation press articles letter and other materials that were attached to the email constituted an offer of securities because they were designed to stimulate interest in bulldogs funds the documents that comprised this offer are forms of expression akin to the advertising materials addressed in numerous first amendment cases involving commercial speech see eg florida bar v went for it inc  us     directmail solicitations bolger v youngs drug prods corp  us    informational pamphlets because such commercial advertising implicates the first amendment see virginia state bd of pharmacy v virginia citizens consumer council inc  us    virginia bd of pharmacy we conclude that bulldogs communications concerning its page  financial products management and investment philosophy are speech protected by the first amendment  the nature of the speech at issue having determined that the communications at issue are protected under the first amendment we next must determine whether the principal type of expression at issue is commercial speech fox supra at  this determination is of consequence because commercial speech has been said to occupy a subordinate position in the scale of first amendment values where modes of regulation are allowed that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression ohralik v ohio state bar assn supra commercial speech is afforded less protection because it is  linked inextricably with the commercial arrangement that it proposes such that the states interest in regulating the underlying transaction may give it a concomitant interest in the expression itself edenfield v fane  us    quoting friedman v rogers  us   n  see  liquormart inc v rhode island  us    plurality opinion note  but commercial speech is still afforded significant constitutional protection because of its importance to consumers and society as a whole see virginia bd of pharmacy supra commercial speech assists consumers and furthers the societal interest in the fullest possible dissemination of

attorneys publication of professional certifications in yellow pages listings and on business cards and other materials while it is difficult to delineate precisely the range of expression that falls into the commercial speech category see cincinnati v discovery network inc  us    speech advertising the price of a product or arguing its merits is a typical example of commercial speech edward j debartolo corp v florida gulf coast bldg  constr trades council  us    some commercial speech may be so inextricably intertwined with noncommercial speech as to lose its commercial character where the nature of the speech taken as a whole is noncommercial see riley v national fedn of the blind of nc inc  us    but the mere presence of noncommercial speech in commercial materials does not alter the commercial character of the surrounding communications see fox supra at  tupperware parties were commercial speech even though they included discussion of financial responsibility and home economics where no law of man or of nature makes it impossible to sell housewares without teaching home economics or to teach home economics without selling housewares communications may thus be categorized as commercial speech notwithstanding the fact that they contain discussions of important public issues bolger v youngs drug prods corp page  supra at  condom manufacturers pamphlet discussing venereal disease and also promoting specific products was commercial speech see zauderer v office of disciplinary counsel of the supreme court of ohio  us    n  zauderer attorneys advertisement offering representation and giving information about legal rights to women alleging injury caused by particular intrauterine device was commercial speech because a company has the full panoply of protections available to its direct comments on public issues    there is no reason for providing similar constitutional protection when such statements are made in the context of commercial transactions bolger v youngs drug prods corp supra at  here having already concluded that the communications at issue were designed to stimulate interest in bulldogs funds and constituted a solicitation of an offer to buy unregistered securities bulldog i supra at  we think it plain that the principal type of expression at issue is commercial speech fox supra at  accordingly we proceed to consider whether the challenged provisions of massachusetts securities law are permissible regulations of commercial speech  the two standards of review for commercial speech the united states supreme court has articulated two distinct standards of review that are applicable in commercial speech cases where the government prohibits a category of commercial speech the supreme court applies an intermediate scrutiny test articulated in central hudson supra at  requiring that restrictions be tailored in a reasonable manner to serve a substantial state interest edenfield v fane  us    striking down ban on inperson solicitation by certified public accountants see sorrell v ims health inc  s ct    state must show statute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest however where the government requires the disclosure of commercial information the court applies a more generous test upholding disclosure requirements that are reasonably related to the states interest in preventing deception of consumers zauderer supra at   recognizing page  material differences between disclosure requirements and outright prohibitions on speech note  in virginia bd of pharmacy supra at  the case in which commercial speech was first held to be protected by the first amendment the court held unconstitutional a state statute that prohibited pharmacists from advertising the price of any prescription drug the court recognized that the states justification for the advertising ban  the fear that price competition would diminish the professionalism of pharmacists and the quality of the services they provide  rests in large measure on the advantages of citizens being kept in ignorance id at  the court noted that the alternative to this highly paternalistic approach    is to assume that this information is not in itself harmful that people will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough informed and that the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication rather than to close them id at  recognizing that the public interest is served where private economic decisions are intelligent and well informed the court concluded that it is precisely this kind of choice between the dangers of suppressing information and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available that the first amendment makes for us id at   since then the supreme court has consistently articulated two key principles in the commercial speech cases it views as dubious any justification that is based on the benefits of public ignorance and it has prescribed that the preferred remedy for the risk to the public of inaccurate or incomplete information is more disclosure rather than less bates v state bar of page  ariz  us    see thompson supra at  we have previously rejected the notion that the government has an interest in preventing the dissemination of truthful commercial information in order to prevent members of the public from making bad decisions with the information applying these principles where the government has suppressed commercial speech and where its suppression has diminished consumers ability to make informed and reliable decisions regarding lawful purchases the supreme court has applied the intermediate scrutiny of the central hudson test or before central hudson a variant of the test and with few exceptions struck down laws suppressing commercial speech see eg thompson supra striking down provisions of federal statute that prohibited pharmacists from advertising compounded drugs lorillard tobacco co v reilly  us   striking down restrictions on outdoor and instore advertising of cigarettes smokeless tobacco and cigars  liquormart inc v rhode island  us   striking down state statute prohibiting retail price advertising of alcoholic beverages central hudson supra striking down ban on advertising by electric utilities that promoted use of electricity linmark assocs inc v willingboro  us   striking down town ordinance prohibiting posting of for sale signs on homes in order to stem flight of white home owners from integrated community note  consistent with the disfavor that these cases demonstrate for laws that suppress information in an attempt to page  influence consumer choice the supreme court recently struck down a state statute that burdened speech in order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction and discourage demand for a particular disfavored product in this case higher priced brandname drugs see sorrell v ims health inc supra at  note  by contrast where a government has required particular commercial disclosures the supreme court has recognized that laws that compel disclosure are consistent with the core principles that underlie the commercial speech doctrine because they are designed to diminish public ignorance and make accurate and complete information available see zauderer supra at  where an advertiser is required to disclose purely factual and uncontroversial information the advertisers rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the states interest in preventing deception of consumers id see milavetz supra at  applying zauderer reasonable relation test to requirement that agencies providing debt relief services disclose that debt relief may involve bankruptcy relief in addition because disclosure requirements trench much more narrowly on an advertisers interests than do flat prohibitions on speech zauderer supra at  the court has repeatedly stated in commercial speech cases that a disclosure requirement is a less burdensome and more appropriate alternative see thompson supra at  central hudson supra at  virginia bd of pharmacy supra at page   n see also citizens united v federal election commn  s ct    upholding disclosure requirements in context of electioneering communications noting disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of speech  application of zauderer reasonable relation test because securities regulation since  has been designed to ensure the availability of adequate information about securities through the requirement of thorough disclosures we analyze whether the challenged provisions satisfy the zauderer reasonable relation test in considering the applicability of this test we note first that a disclosure requirement typically incorporates a prohibition on commercial speech or conduct because the commercial speaker is generally barred from advertising or engaging in particular conduct unless the speaker makes the disclosure see eg milavetz supra at  requirement that debt relief agencies make required disclosure in advertisements operates as ban on advertising unless disclosure is made zauderer supra at  requirement that attorneys advertising contingent fee arrangements make required disclosures operates as ban on advertising contingent fee representation without disclosures thus the existence of a conditional prohibition on commercial speech which the speaker may avoid by making the disclosure does not itself subject the disclosure requirement to the central hudson test see zauderer supra at  rather a typical disclosure requirement incorporates a ban on speech or conduct that defines and enforces the disclosure rule the fundamental principle woven into massachusetts securities laws as well as the  act and its accompanying regulations is complete and accurate disclosure in the sale of securities this is not only clear from the purpose and history of the  act described in its preamble as an act to provide full and fair disclosure pub l no   stat  may   but is apparent from the plain language of the federal and state provisions at issue in this case by requiring the filing of a registration statement before a public offering can be made the massachusetts act ensures that potential buyers are provided with detailed information about the securities being offered and the entities offering them including financial statements that page  have been certified by an independent accountant in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles see g l c a §§   code mass regs §§   c  the prohibition against public offerings that bulldog challenges as a violation of the first amendment right to free speech is simply the means to enforce the disclosure requirements for a public offering specifically the filing of a registration statement while a registration statement is not required for a private offering of securities a private offering as the name suggests is a limited exemption from the general registration requirement permitting offers to accredited and sophisticated investors who precisely because they are accredited and sophisticated are deemed able to fend for themselves see securities  exch commn v ralston purina co  us    n   neither the federal nor the state government has prevented bulldog from making information about its securities available to the general public because nothing prevents bulldog from filing a registration statement with all its required disclosures and advertising its securities to the general public this is not a case in which the government seeks to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good  liquormart inc v rhode island  us    plurality opinion see virginia bd of pharmacy supra at  rather the prohibition on speech at issue in this case is incorporated into a disclosure regime that is designed to encourage not suppress full and fair disclosure bulldog argues that the supreme courts application of the central hudson test in thompson supra at  demonstrates that this case should also be analyzed as a prohibition on speech where that test is applied thompson supra at    involved three provisions of federal law a requirement that all new drugs submit to federal new drug approval procedures an exemption to these approval procedures for compounded drugs created when a pharmacist combines or alters ingredients such as to generate a medication tailored to a particular patients needs and a ban on advertising of compounded drugs that had not been approved through the new drug approval procedures bulldog argues that its decision not page  to file a registration statement is analogous to a compounders decision not to seek federal new drug approval and that the ban on general solicitation should be reviewed under the central hudson test as was the advertising ban in the thompson case however none of the parties in thompson challenged the appropriateness of applying the central hudson test and the court did not discuss how or under what circumstances a different test might be applicable thompson supra at  this is probably because it was undisputed in thompson that approval was too costly to be practicable for a small scale compounded drug designed for the needs of an individual patient so that requiring federal approval of all drug products compounded by pharmacies would effectively eliminate the practice of compounding id at  the ban on advertising at issue in thompson while theoretically conditional was not designed to enforce a disclosure requirement imposed on drugs that obtain federal approval rather the ban was enacted to prevent compounders from successfully marketing new drugs on a large scale without undergoing the federal new drug approval process a purpose that the court found could be served by directly regulating compounded drug production rather than regulating speech id at  thompson supra thus involved the type of speech ban that is typically analyzed under the central hudson test because it limits the information available to the public about lawful purchases and threatens societal interests in broad access to complete and accurate commercial information that first amendment coverage of commercial speech is designed to safeguard edenfield v fane  us    and cases cited bulldog further argues that even if the prohibition on general solicitation is incidental to a disclosure scheme the standard articulated in zauderer supra at  is not applicable because that case asks whether a disclosure requirement is reasonably related to the states interest in preventing deception of consumers and no deception is alleged in this case instead the parties stipulated that the information on bulldogs web site and in its direct email communication with hickey was not misleading we recognize that the disclosures required in milavetz and zauderer were intended to combat inherently misleading advertisements page  but we do not agree that the more deferential review for required commercial disclosures applies only to disclosures designed to prevent deception and not to disclosures designed to ensure that consumers have full and fair information both milavetz and zauderer treat disclosures differently from restrictions on speech because of the commercial speakers minimal constitutionally protected interest in not providing factual and uncontroversial information and because disclosure rules serve the social interest in increasing the information available to the public an interest that undergirds the protection of commercial speech in the first place zauderer supra see milavetz supra at  central hudson supra at  virginia bd of pharmacy supra at  note  because milavetz and zauderer do not expressly limit the reasonable relation test to the particular state interest in preventing consumer deception and the rationales on which they rely are equally applicable to the state interest asserted here of ensuring full and accurate information to securities investors we conclude that the appropriate first amendment test in this case is the reasonable relation test in zauderer supra not the central hudson test note  accord new york state restaurant assn v new york city bd of health  fd   d cir  requirement that chain restaurants post calorie information analyzed pursuant to zauderer test although state not acting to prevent consumer deception pharmaceutical care mgt assn v rowe  fd   n st cir  cert denied  us   we have found no page  cases limiting zauderer to state interest in preventing consumer deception see  liquormart inc v rhode island  us    plurality opinion when a state regulates commercial messages to protect consumers from misleading deceptive or aggressive sales practices or requires the disclosure of beneficial consumer information the purpose of its regulation is consistent with the reasons for according constitutional protection to commercial speech and therefore justifies less than strict review emphasis added applying the zauderer reasonable relation test we conclude that the disclosure requirement at issue here a registration statement that must be in effect prior to a public offering of securities is reasonably related to the states interest in promoting the integrity of capital markets by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate information where the issuer has chosen not to file a registration statement and make the required disclosures the incidental ban on general solicitation of unregistered securities is reasonably related to the same state interest  application of central hudson test even if we were to view the challenged regulations at issue as prohibitions on commercial speech rather than as part of a broader disclosure requirement we conclude that they withstand constitutional scrutiny under the central hudson test in central hudson supra at  the court established a fourpronged test to determine the constitutionality of restrictions on commercial speech at the outset we must determine whether the expression is protected by the first amendment for commercial speech to come within that provision it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading next we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial if both inquiries yield positive answers we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest see lorillard tobacco co v reilly  us    rubin v coors brewing co  us    the government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of page  its regulation under this test see bolger v youngs drug prods corp  us   n  note  here the first and second prongs are not at issue because the parties have stipulated that the speech in this case concerns lawful activity and is not misleading and that the commonwealth has a substantial state interest in protecting the integrity of capital markets and thereby preserving the overall health of the economy by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate information thus we need only determine whether the third and fourth prongs of central hudson are satisfied that is whether the challenged regulations directly advance the substantial government interest and are not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest id at   under the third prong of central hudson we must determine whether the speech restriction directly and materially advances the asserted governmental interest greater new orleans broadcasting assn v united states  us    this burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture rather a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree edenfield v fane  us    see greater new orleans broadcasting assn v united states supra accordingly a restriction on commercial speech page  will not be upheld if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the governments purpose central hudson supra at  bulldog asks us to construe this direct advancement prong of central hudson as a requirement that the connection between the regulation of speech and the states interest not depend on intermediate steps this reading however is unsupported by the supreme courts commercial speech jurisprudence which has emphasized the reliability and effectiveness with which a regulatory mechanism advances the states goal rather than the presence or absence of intermediate steps in central hudson supra at  the court found that a regulation that prohibited an electric utility from promoting the use of electricity in advertisements had a direct link to the state interest in energy conservation and satisfied the third prong of the test although it is clear that the effect of the regulation on the state interest depended on the choices of consumers see florida bar v went for it inc  us     united states v edge broadcasting co  us    similarly where the supreme court has found the third prong of the central hudson test not to be satisfied it has not highlighted the presence of intermediate causal steps but rather has emphasized the ineffectiveness of the regulation at serving the states objective see eg sorrell v ims health inc  s ct    law limiting use of prescriber information in connection with marketing efforts but allowing extensive use of prescriberidentifying information in other contexts did not advance interest of protecting prescriber privacy lowering costs of medical care or promoting public health greater new orleans broadcasting assn v united states supra at  quoting rubin v coors brewing co supra at  finding  little chance that the speech restriction could have directly and materially advanced its aim while other provisions of the same act directly undermined and counteracted its effects  in this case the secretary offered in evidence the report and testimony of franco an expert witness who teaches and writes about securities regulation and who served as assistant general counsel in the secs office of general counsel note  finding page  francos opinions to be wellfounded and highly credible the trial judge adopted them in substance on the issue of effectiveness the judge found the public filing of a registration statement conforming in both form and content to uniform regulatory requirements serves to provide complete balanced and accurate information not only to those who might consider investing in a particular offering but also to the public as a whole including regulatory officials private analysts large investors and the news media whose review serves as a powerful check on the accuracy and completeness of the information provided that process tends to result in market prices that accurately reflect value for the benefit of all investors both those purchasing the particular issue and those trading in other securities the ban on general advertising of unregistered securities    provides a powerful incentive for issuers to register despite the substantial costs of doing so thereby maximizing the benefits of the registration system to the public as a whole    it is vital to the effectiveness of the registration system we adopt these findings and agree that the public filing of a registration statement provides the best assurance that investors in publicly offered securities will make decisions based on full and accurate information we also consider compelling the experts conclusion that the registration systems ability to promote wellinformed markets would be compromised if unregistered securities could be widely advertised using incomplete information selected by the issuer therefore we conclude that the prohibition against publicly advertising an offer to sell unregistered securities about which the required disclosures have not been made available effectively directly and materially advances the states interest in preserving the integrity of capital markets by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full page  and accurate information see greater new orleans broadcasting assn v united states supra at  note  the fourth prong of central hudson supra at  asks whether a challenged regulation is more extensive than is necessary to serve the asserted government interest in fox supra at  the supreme court clarified that this prong does not require the regulatory scheme to be the least restrictive means of achieving the governments objective rather it analyzes the fit between governmental objectives and the regulatory means chosen and requires that fit to be not necessarily perfect but reasonable see sorrell v ims health inc supra at  quoting fox supra at  regulation must be drawn to achieve the state interest and requires fit between the legislatures ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends lorillard tobacco co v reilly  us    fourth prong requires a reasonable fit between the means and ends of the regulatory scheme the fourth prong of central hudson is therefore an inquiry into whether the scope of the restriction on speech is in proportion to the interest served by the restriction see sorrell v ims health inc supra greater new orleans broadcasting assn v united states supra fox supra although the costs to free speech must be carefully calculated governments have leeway to judge what manner of regulation may best be employed id at   note  in this case bulldog has offered eleven alternative measures page  that they suggest would serve the asserted state interest with less restriction on speech and the parties have stipulated that these are the only alternative means that are at issue in this litigation these alternatives propose to shift regulation from the offer stage to the point of sale by preserving the restrictions on the sale of unregistered securities while permitting solicitation of offers from the general public instead of regulating offers the alternatives would provide additional regulation at the point of sale such as extra reporting requirements additional controls on the accreditation of investors a waiting period before transactions became final or authorization to the secretary to rescind transactions that fail to comply with applicable law note  the judge relying on francos expert opinion found that these alternatives would decrease the protection of investors and impair market integrity the judge declared all of the plaintiffs proposals would reduce the incentive to register and encourage issuers to make unregistered offerings sacrificing lawful access to some potential buyers in favor of saving the costs of registration    all of the proposals would likely result in increased distortive that is unbalanced communications increased incidence of unlawful transactions such as sales to unaccredited investors and proliferation of scams those proposals that rely on increased enforcement activity in connection with sales would suffer from the problem of coming after rather than before transactions when dissipation of assets may prevent effective remedies page  we agree the proposed alternatives will certainly decrease the quality of and will likely decrease the quantity of information in the marketplace will increase the likelihood of securities scams and of unlawful sales of unregistered securities to unsophisticated investors and will weaken the markets efficiency overall bulldogs proposal to concentrate enforcement at the point of sale rather than at the offer stage increases the risk that enforcement will come too late to prevent the harm or permit monetary recovery we note that state securities regulation before  largely focused on the regulation of transactions at the point of sale and that the failure of this patchwork of state laws to achieve their regulatory aims demonstrated the need for the federal  act keller introductory comment a historical introduction to the securities act of  and the securities exchange act of  symposium on current issues in securities regulation  ohio st lj     the framers of the  act contemplated the drawbacks of afterthefact enforcement and determined that these measures lock the door after the horse is gone and prevent regulators from effectively protecting investors from economic harm hon huston thompson federal securities act hearings before the house interstate and foreign commerce committee d cong st sess on hr  at   quoting statement of hon clarence f lee of california hearings before committee on interstate and foreign commerce on hr  th cong st sess in concluding that the challenged restriction on the public advertising of unregistered securities represents a reasonable fit between the regulatory ends and the means chosen we recognize that this restriction is not a blanket ban on speech central hudson supra at  n that can be considered in isolation but an integral part of a broader regulatory scheme that mandates public disclosures and permits limited exemptions for private offerings directed at those investors who can be relied on adequately to inform themselves see thompson supra at  recognizing disclosure as far less restrictive alternative to a restriction on commercial speech we also recognize that if we were to declare the restriction unconstitutional in the name of freedom of speech the foreseeable consequence would be less page  speech not more see citizens united v federal election commn  s ct    it is our law and our tradition that more speech not less is the governing rule rubin v coors brewing co  us    stevens j concurring in the judgment more speech and a better informed citizenry are among the central goals of the free speech clause in addition we consider that the burden on first amendment rights is diminished in this case because alternative channels of communication are available to bulldog through the registration system and through the exemptions that permit communication with a limited group of investors see florida bar v went for it inc  us    finding no basis to question the commonsense conclusion that the many alternative channels for communicating necessary information about attorneys are sufficient we see no defect in floridas regulation by providing exemptions for private offerings designed to lessen the burdens of securities laws when the protections of the regulatory system are not needed see securities  exch commn v ralston purina co  us    n   the secretary has carefully calculated the benefits and burdens of securities regulation cincinnati v discovery network inc  us    rather than proceed by wholesale suppression of truthful nonmisleading information  liquormart inc v rhode island  us    plurality opinion see lorillard tobacco co v reilly  us    finally we recognize that a measure of judicial restraint is appropriate where a court is asked to intrude on a system of securities regulation that has served the nation and this commonwealth well since  and to cut a stitch in the patchwork of regulatory enforcement that risks its unraveling and predictably will diminish its effectiveness if any reminder was needed the financial collapse in the autumn of  that led to our persistent recession illustrates the extent to which unregulated and poorly regulated securities have the potential to become financial weapons of mass destruction the great derivatives smackdown forbes may   quoting warren buffetts annual letter to shareholders of berkshire hathaway march   page  in light of these considerations and the judges findings supported by credible expert testimony that none of the proposed alternatives would adequately achieve the state interest we are persuaded that the secretary has found a fit between its regulatory means and its goal of promoting full and accurate information in the sale of securities that is not necessarily perfect but reasonable united states v edge broadcasting co  us    we therefore conclude that the secretary has met his burden of satisfying the central hudson test  the overbreadth doctrine having found that the speech at issue in this case is commercial and that the challenged provisions of massachusetts securities law constitutionally regulate that speech we now consider bulldogs claim that the regulations should nonetheless be found unconstitutional because they also restrict fully protected noncommercial speech in violation of the first amendment the overbreadth doctrine allows an individual whose speech may be constitutionally regulated to argue that a law is unconstitutional because it infringes on the speech of others see fox supra at  see also united states v stevens  s ct    overbreadth has thus been described as an exception to the general principle that litigants only have standing to assert their own rights and not the rights of others in the free speech context such challenges have been permitted in order to prevent a statute from chilling the first amendment rights of other parties not before the court secretary of state of md v joseph h munson co  us     see eisenstadt v baird  us   n  note  despite the doctrines origin as an exception to standing requirements overbreadth challenges can also be brought as here where a laws application to the principal type of expression at issue in the case is constitutional but the plaintiffs argue that their own first amendment rights will be violated by other applications of the same law fox supra at   the supreme court has recognized the overbreadth doctrine page  as strong medicine and has limited its application to instances where a law prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech united states v williams  us     quoting los angeles police dept v united reporting publ corp  us    substantial overbreadth demands a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized first amendment protections of parties not before the court city council of los angeles v taxpayers for vincent  us    declining to entertain overbreadth claim where such danger not shown further the overbreadth must be substantial not only in an absolute sense but also relative to the statutes plainly legitimate sweep united states v williams supra at  the overbreadth doctrine is not applied in commercial speech cases because the concern that speech will be chilled is much weaker in the case of a commercial speaker see bates v state bar of ariz  us    since advertising is linked to commercial wellbeing it seems unlikely that such speech is particularly susceptible to being crushed by overbroad regulation see also waters v churchill  us    plurality opinion fox supra at  however this limitation is only relevant in cases where the speech restricted by the overbroad application is itself commercial speech an overbreadth challenge may be raised by a commercial speaker claiming as here that a regulation unconstitutionally restricts noncommercial speech id we turn therefore to the question whether the relevant provisions of massachusetts securities law reach a substantial amount of noncommercial speech united states v williams supra bulldog alleges for example that they are prevented from communicating about their unregistered securities with anyone including journalists students academics and others even though these individuals are not interested in buying or selling securities however under the challenged provisions of massachusetts securities law an issuers speech is restricted only where it is designed to solicit an offer to purchase securities see g l c a §§   i  see also matter of carl m loeb rhoades  co  sec    allowing for flow of normal corporate news unrelated to a selling effort page  for an issue of securities interpretive release on regulation d sec release no   fed reg    if communication not being used by the

solicitation generic in nature and not making reference to any specific investment not an offer g l c a §  interpretation of massachusetts act should be coordinated with related federal law bulldog can raise an overbreadth challenge therefore only if a substantial amount of speech included within the term offer is outside that which is categorized as commercial speech note  while the precise bounds of the category of expression that may be termed commercial speech are uncertain zauderer supra at  the definition of an offer in securities law as a communication designed to procure orders for a security matter of carl m loeb rhoades  co supra at  securities act release no  july   is close to the common definition of commercial speech as that which proposes a commercial transaction fox supra at  quoting virginia bd of pharmacy supra at  although the outer limits of the two terms may not be identical we conclude that the category of offers regulated by the secretary and the sec does not include a substantial amount of noncommercial speech relative to the plainly legitimate sweep of the statute and regulations see united states v williams supra as a result bulldogs overbreadth challenge fails  blonesss right to listen bloness alleges that his first amendment rights are independently violated by the secretarys page  enforcement of securities laws and regulations that prevent him from receiving information that bulldog would otherwise make available unless he first identifies himself and demonstrates he is an accredited or sophisticated investor note  we agree with bloness that the interests of consumers in receiving commercial information and the interests of society in the free flow of such information have been the foundation of commercial speech doctrine from its inception see central hudson supra at  suppression of advertising reduces the information available for consumer decisions and thereby defeats the purpose of the first amendment virginia bd of pharmacy supra at  as to the particular consumers interest in the free flow of commercial information that interest may be as keen if not keener by far than his interest in the days most urgent political debate see also lorillard tobacco co v reilly  us    the first amendment    constrains state efforts to limit advertising of tobacco products because so long as the sale and use of tobacco is lawful for adults the tobacco industry has a protected interest in communicating information about its products and adult customers have an interest in receiving that information we also agree that the supreme court has in certain cases recognized the rights of listeners regardless whether the rights of the speakers were protected see kleindienst v mandel  us    first amendment rights of listeners implicated where federal government denied visa to foreign lecturer because of his advocacy of communism lamont v postmaster gen  us    first amendment rights of recipient violated by postal service requirement that communist political propaganda originating in foreign country be delivered only if addressee filled out reply card indicating desire to receive such mail see also stanley v georgia  us     it is now well established that the constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas and we agree that in certain circumstances a listeners first amendment rights may be infringed if he is required affirmatively to declare a desire to receive controversial communications page  where the requirement may deter him from requesting these communications because of the risk to reputation employment or prospects for future employment see lamont v postmaster gen supra at  see also denver area educ telecomm consortium inc v fcc  us    striking down federal requirement that patently offensive cable television programming be blocked and made available on separate channel only to subscribers who requested in writing to view the offensive content but nothing in the cases bloness cites requires independent consideration of his claim in this case where we have already concluded that the government has permissibly regulated the communications of a commercial speaker the consequence of recognizing the first amendment rights of listeners is to give standing to listeners to assert that free speech has been unconstitutionally infringed not to grant listeners a different standard of review or a greater right to listen to commercial speech than a speaker has to say it see fox supra at    central hudson was applicable standard where state university students claimed that violation of their first amendment rights resulted from universitys restriction of outside commercial speakers virginia bd of pharmacy supra at  if there is a right to advertise there is a reciprocal right to receive the advertising and it may be asserted by consumers spargo v new york state commn on judicial conduct  fd   d cir  cert denied  us   listeners may claim no greater first amendment protection than speaker national assn for the advancement of colored people v jones  fd   th cir  cert denied  us   no precedent exists for the proposition that the listeners rights are greater than those of the speaker where as here a state permissibly regulates commercial speech in a manner consistent with the first amendment its regulation will be upheld regardless whether the challenge is brought by a speaker or by a wouldbe listener see fox supra see also american future sys inc v pennsylvania state univ  fd   d cir  cert denied sub nom johnson v pennsylvania state univ  us   the essential nature of the speech remains unchanged regardless of whose rights are being adjudicated page  and the same test should be used whether it is the speakers or the listeners rights that are at stake having found that bulldogs first amendment rights were not violated by the secretarys enforcement of massachusetts securities laws we need undergo no further analysis to conclude that the rights of bloness to receive information were not violated v conclusion the supreme court has on numerous occasions suggested that federal and state securities laws do not run afoul of the first amendment note  although these statements have been dicta they have also been consistent with the courts recognition of a states lawful ability to ensure that the stream of commercial information flows cleanly as well as freely virginia bd of pharmacy supra at  by encouraging the submission of comprehensive registration statements and allowing those who choose not to file them to advertise their securities to accredited and sophisticated investors but not to the public as a whole the secretary does not threaten societal interests in broad access to complete and accurate commercial information that first amendment coverage of commercial speech is designed to safeguard edenfield v fane  us    massachusetts securities regulation is not motivated by the supposed advantages of consumers being kept in ignorance virginia bd of pharmacy supra at  or designed to entirely suppress commercial speech in order to pursue a nonspeechrelated policy central hudson supra at  n nor has massachusetts burdened a form of protected expression that it found too persuasive while leaving unburdened speech that is in accord with its own views sorrell v ims health inc  s ct    rather the massachusetts act and accompanying regulations aid the page  preservation of a fair bargaining process  liquormart inc v rhode island  us    plurality opinion by ensuring the broad availability of accurate and balanced commercial information for the reasons discussed above we hold that the challenged provisions of massachusetts law are part of a constitutionally permissible

particular commercial speech disclosures such laws attempt to prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics nationalism religion or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein zauderer v office of disciplinary counsel of the supreme court of ohio  us    zauderer quoting west virginia state bd of educ v barnette  us    note  where the court has applied the intermediate scrutiny test of central hudson gas  elec corp v public serv commn of ny  us    central hudson and upheld a restriction on speech the challenged restriction generally addressed concerns relating to the means of delivering the regulated speech rather than the content of the speech itself in ohralik v ohio state bar assn  us   the supreme court held that a state bar could discipline an attorney for visiting an accident victim in her hospital room and asking her to sign a representation agreement the court reasoned that inperson solicitation inherently exerted pressure on the potential client to provide an immediate response to the offer of legal representation and thereby encouraged speedy and perhaps uninformed decisionmaking solicitation of this sort could well disserve the individual and societal interest    in facilitating informed and reliable decisionmaking  id at   quoting bates v state bar of ariz  us    see florida bar v went for it inc  us   upholding florida bar rules prohibiting attorneys from sending targeted mail solicitations to victims and relatives for thirty days following accident or disaster concluding that such solicitation is intrusion on privacy that reflects poorly on legal profession the court has also upheld a restriction on broadcast advertising where the services advertised were illegal in the broadcasters state see united states v edge broadcasting co  us   upholding federal statute barring broadcast of lottery advertising by broadcasters located in states that prohibit lotteries note  in sorrell v ims health inc  s ct    the supreme court declared that where speech is restricted or burdened based on its content heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted the court explained however that heightened scrutiny is required whenever the government creates a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys  id quoting ward v rock against racism  us    unlike the speech restriction at issue in sorrell v ims health inc supra the regulation of securities offers at issue in this case is intended to ensure the availability of full and fair information about securities and does not arise because of disagreement with the message note  we further note that in a recent supreme court case justice thomas invited the court to state expressly that disclosure requirements are constitutional only where aimed at advertising that is inherently likely to deceive or has in fact been deceptive    emphasis added milavetz gallop  milavetz pa v united states  s ct    thomas j concurring in part and concurring in the judgment quoting matter of rmj  us    the court declined to articulate such a limitation and no other justice joined justice thomas note  we note that this

amendment grounds see riley v national fedn of the blind of nc inc  us   n  citing zauderer supra analogy to the securities field entirely misses the point purely commercial speech is more susceptible to compelled disclosure requirements note  although the supreme court has continued to apply the central hudson test see sorrell v ims health inc  s ct    lorillard tobacco co v reilly  us    we

commercial   liquormart inc v rhode island  us    scalia j concurring in part and concurring in the judgment central hudson test seems to me to have nothing more than policy intuition to support it the application of central hudson has generated the strongest doubts from members of the court where advertising has been restricted to quell demand for a lawful advertised product such as tobacco

cases made clear that if the government could achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict speech or that restricts less speech the government must do so the courts recent decision in

investors general partnership et al v william f galvin secretary of the commonwealth civil action no bls     decided september   findings of fact rulings of law andorder for judgment introductionthis action arises from activities of the office of the secretary of the commonwealth in enforcing massachusetts securities laws with respect to certain communications regarding hedge funds particularly a website operated by the group of plaintiffs who will be referred to herein collectively as “bulldog investors”or “bulldog”and associated email communication   the plaintiffs contend that the secretarys enforcement activities have violated their rights under the first amendment to the united states constitution   this court has issued two previous decisions in this action one on the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction dated december   and one on the defendants partial motion to dismiss dated july    after a jurywaived trial on july   the court now enters the following findings of fact rulings of law and order for judgmentbackgroundthe stipulation of the parties along with exhibits admitted by stipulation provide the following factual background   plaintiff bulldog investors general partnership is a general partnership   three of its general partners are private investment partnerships known as hedge funds  the plaintiffs opportunity partners lp full value partners l p and opportunity income plus fund lp the fourth general partner and managing partner is the plaintiff kimball  winthrop inc which is the sole general partner of opportunity partners   plaintiffs full value advisors llc and spar advisors llc are the sole general partner and investment advisor to full value partners and opportunity income plus fund respectively   plaintiffs steven samuels phillip goldstein andrew dakos and rajeev das are principals of one or more of the abovedescribed entities   these entities and individuals will be referred to herein collectively as bulldog investors or bulldog   bulldog investors has not registered any offering of securities with the securities and exchange commission “sec”   in  and  respectively opportunity partners and full value fund filed “form d” with the sec claiming exemption from registration requirements plaintiff leonard bloness “bloness” a resident of sheffield massachusetts is not affiliated with bulldog investors   bloness desires to have access to information about bulldog investors including the information conveyed through the communications in issue in this case   he does not intend to and has never intended to or attempted to invest in any bulldog fund   bloness is an accredited investor for the purposes of  cfr § afrom about june   to january   bulldog investors maintained an interactive website that provided information about the investment products it offered   the website made certain information available to any visitor including press articles and a printable brochure describing bulldogs three investment vehicles opportunity partners full value partners and opportunity income plus fund the brochure gave a brief summary of each funds approach   it described opportunity partners as “a highly diversified fund primarily invested in publiclytraded closedend mutual funds and operating companies that are selling substantially below their intrinsic values ․ that applies the firms proprietary investment methodology to ‘unlock’ these values”   full value partners was described as “a fund that concentrates on taking substantial positions in undervalued operating companies and closedend mutual funds” and that “acts as a catalyst to ‘unlock’ these values through proprietary means”   income plus funds according to the brochure “is a lowrisk fund that primarily invests in undervalued income producing closedend funds real estate investment trusts and other investments ․ attempts to produce better current returns with less risk than is achievable in the bond markets ․ and anticipates compounding of capital in addition to generating high current income”   each fund the brochure stated “will hedge when deemed appropriate”   a link on the site available to any visitor provided the statement that “bulldog investors has delivered a net average annual return significantly higher than that of the s  p  index   moreover bulldog has performed especially well in difficult investment periods like  through ”the website provided additional information to a visitor who would click “i agree” to the following disclaimerthe information is available for information purposes

funds and their performance could request such information by clicking on a button labeled “send feedback” which would lead to a registration screen seeking personal identifying information including the visitors address   to register a visitor would be required to acknowledge having read and agreed to the foregoing disclaimeron november   brendan hickey “hickey” registered on the bulldog website entering his massachusetts address   hickey was an employee of a law firm that was representing a client in litigation with bulldog and acted at the direction of his employer   he was not an accredited investor   samuels responded to hickey by email attaching additional materials including information about the funds investment strategy and philosophy the backgrounds of their managers performance and recent successes and news articles   samuelss email statedwhile we are proud to have one of the best long term records in the business it is very difficult to adequately describe what why and how we do what we do in a quick response to an email inquiry   performance numbers for example show nothing of the risk taken to achieve those returns   i have attached some basic information on our management including performance and philosophy   i would be happy to spend a few minutes on the phone if you wish to discuss in more detail   please contact me at a telephone number providedamong the materials samuels attached to his email to hickey was a copy of a letter dated july   directed to investors in bulldogs funds   the letter discussed the funds returns as compared to the standard  poor  index current investments in particular companies and a lawsuit against the sec challenging a rule requiring registration of certain hedge fund managers   it then statedwe dont need a nanny regulator to tell us right from wrong   and unlike most mutual fund managers we put our money where our mouths are   since day one a significant portion of our net worth has been invested in full value partners so you can be sure that our interests are closely aligned with yours   in our opinion that is more important than all the cosmetic rules and regulations any regulator can dream upon january   the enforcement section of the massachusetts securities division filed an administrative complaint with the acting director of the securities division against bulldog alleging that bulldog had offered securities for sale in the commonwealth that were not properly registered or exempt in violation of gl c a the massachusetts uniform securities act and regulations thereunder  cmr §  et seq by means of the communications appearing in the website   the enforcement section sought a cease and desist order an administrative fine and other relief   bulldog answered the administrative complaint on february   denying the allegations and raising as a defense that the administrative complaint abridged its rights under the first amendment to the united states constitutionon march   while the administrative proceeding was pending the plaintiffs filed this action against the secretary seeking relief pursuant to  usc §  from the alleged violation of their first amendment rights  contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction   the court gants j declined to hear the motion at that time preferring to await the secretarys action on the pending administrative complaint   when the administrative complaint remained pending several months later after proceedings on crossmotions for summary disposition in the administrative forum the plaintiffs here renewed their request for preliminary injunctive relief and this court set a briefing schedule and scheduled a hearing for october  on october   the acting director of the securities division issued a final order on behalf of the secretary concluding the administrative proceeding   the secretarys final order adopted the hearing officers findings of fact consistent with the stipulated facts set forth supra and her rulings of law in substance as follows   the massachusetts uniform securities actgl c a §  makes it unlawful for any person to offer securities for sale in the commonwealth unless the securities are registered the transaction is exempt or the security is “federally covered”   the act defines an offer to sell to include “every attempt or offer to dispose of or solicitation of an offer to buy a security or interest in a security for value”  gl c a§   the act further provides that it should be construed so as to coordinate its interpretation and administration consistently with federal securities law  gl c a §    under federal case law and sec decisions an offer extends beyond the common law contract concept to include information that “conditions the public interest in particular securities”   see sec v cavanaugh  fd   d cir  carl m loeb rhodes  co  sec   under that definition the hearing officer ruled “it is clear respondents have offered securities for sale in the commonwealth” by disseminating the information on the website in combination with the email communication directed to mr hickey   citing sec decisions the hearing officer rejected the contention that the website material did not constitute an offer because a visitor to the site who sought specific information about funds would have to register indicating agreement to the disclaimer   the hearing officer went on to rule that bulldog had not proved that it was exempt from registration requirements   the only exemption invoked was that under  cmr § bm which exempts offers communicated through the internet if not “directed toward any investor or group of investors in the commonwealth”and presumes that such an offer is not so directed if it “contains indications that the offer is not being made in jurisdictions where it is not registered or appropriately exempted”   that exemption did not apply the hearing officer ruled because of the email with attached material directed specifically at a massachusetts resident   the hearing officer also ruled that bulldogs activities were not exempt under other specified regulatory provisions that condition exemption on compliance with a ban on general advertising   based on those findings and rulings the securities division ordered that bulldog cease and desist from further violations comply with the act and pay an administrative fine of this court heard argument on the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction onoctober     after receiving supplemental briefs addressed to the secretarys final decision the court issued its decision on the motion on december     the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the meritsin reaching that conclusion the court noted at the outset that the plaintiffs had not identified any court decision at any level striking down on first amendment grounds any statute regulation or application of either with respect to the conduct of issuers in offering or advertising securities  the court noted further that the united states supreme court has on a number of occasions cited the securities area as an example of speech regulation that does not violate the first amendment   see dun  bradstreet inc v greenmoss builders  us   n    ohralik v ohio state bar assn  us     paris adult theater i v slaton  us     see also national association for adv of psychoanalysis v california   bd of psych  fd    th cir  securities  exchange commission v wall street pub inst inc  fd   dccir  bangor  arrostook rr company v interstate commerce commn  fd    st cir  european connections  tours inc v gonzales  fsuppd   n dga  see generally michael siebecker corporate speech securities regulation and an institutional approach to the first amendment  william  mary lrev    the court observed that although the supreme courts comments on this subject were dicta their repetition provided strong guidance to this court in its task of predicting how appellate courts would resolve the question   see schwab v crosby  fd    th cir  harbury v dench  fd   dd cthe court proceeded to determine the nature of the conduct affected by the regulationthat is whether it is speech and if so what kind commercial or noncommercial   the court noted the plaintiffs contention that the communications in issue are noncommercial speech because they do not propose any commercial transaction and the defendants opposing contention that the conduct in issue is not speech at all but is merely incidental to a regulable transaction that is the sale of securities   see lowe  us at  “offer and acceptance are communications incidental to the regulable transaction called a contract”   the court rejected both arguments relying on the content of the website materials and email attachments to conclude that they were neither acts of offer and acceptance in a direct contract sense nor merely information about hedge funds in general or bulldog funds in particular but rather communications in the nature of advertising calculated to generate interest in investment in bulldogs funds directly analogous to the advertising in issue in virginia pharmacy bd v virginia citizens consumer council  us      on that basis the court concluded that the communications were commercial speech in the sense that the expression is “related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience”   central hudson gas  elec v public serv commn  us      accordingly the court applied the fourpart test set forth in that decision to evaluate the validity of the secretarys enforcement of the massachusetts statute and regulationswith respect to the first prong of the test the court concluded that the speech provided truthful information about lawful activitiesthat is operation of hedge funds and investment in them   on the second prong the court identified the state interest advanced as justification for the regulatory scheme  to protect the integrity of capital markets and thereby to preserve the overall health of the economy by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate material information   the court concluded that this interest is substantial noting the catastrophic consequences of the absence of effective regulation manifested during the great depression following which congress enacted the federal securities act of  and states including massachusetts enacted various corresponding provisions   see sec v capital gains research bureau inc  us     sec v ralston purina co  us     in the matter of carl m loeb rhoades  co  sec at   smith v fishback  swd   texcivapp  in re leach  cal     stewart v brady

court then turned to the third and fourth prongs of the central hudson test which together determine whether the regulation is “in proportion to that interest”   these prongs ask whether a challenged regulation directly advances the state interest and whether the interest “could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech․”   us at    the court concluded based on the limited record available at the preliminary injunction stage that the secretary was likely to succeed in showing that the regulatory scheme satisfies both prongs   as to the third prong the court expressed the view that the statute and regulations serve the states interest directly by limiting solicitation of offers to those who have made full disclosure in connection with registration   see gl c a § the court identified the fourth prong of the central hudson test as the most difficult to apply but found it likely that the secretary would succeed in showing “a ‘fit’ between the legislatures ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends․ a fit that is not necessarily perfect but reasonable  that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is ‘in proportion to the interest served’ ”  board of trustees of the st univ of ny v fox  us    quoting posadas de puerto rico assocs v tourism co of puerto rico  us    and in re rm j  us      in reaching that conclusion the court noted particularly that the essence of the regulatory scheme was the requirement of disclosure and that disclosure requirements “trench much more narrowly on an advertisers interests than do flat prohibitions on speech”so that “an advertisers rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the states interest in preventing deception of consumers”  zauderer v office of disciplinary counsel us      see also pharmaceutical care mgmt assn v rowe  fd    st cir   based on these conclusions the court denied the motion for preliminary injunctionafter that ruling the parties conducted discovery exchanged information and negotiated a comprehensive stipulation   in addition to the factual background as set forth supra the parties stipulated to certain matters of mixed fact and law and to certain limitations on the issues to be litigated   the parties agreed for purposes of the central hudson test that bulldogs communications through the combination of its website and the email were not misleading and did not relate to any unlawful transaction   the parties also agreed that “it is a substantial state interest” of massachusetts “to protect the integrity of capital markets and thereby to preserve the overall health of the economy by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate information”   thus the parties agreed the only disputed issues under the central hudson test are the third and fourth prongs    whether the statute and regulations directly advance that interest and whether they intrude on speech more than necessary to achieve the governments interest   see central hudson  us at    the parties further stipulated that for the purposes of determining whether the regulatory scheme is more intrusive than necessary the court need not consider any alternatives other than the eleven proposals suggested by bulldog and set forth in the stipulation the evidence at trial held on july   consisted of a set of agreed exhibits and the expert testimony of professor joseph franco of suffolk university law school a law professor with specialized training and experience in economics and securities regulation   among the exhibits is an extensive written report of professor franco expressing opinions consistent with his trial testimony and addressing in detail each of the plaintiffs proposed alternatives   professor francos opinion in substance is that the regulatory scheme directly serves the identified governmental interest and that none of the alternatives would do so as effectively   findings rulings and discussionas a threshold matter each side contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law without the need for any findings of fact and without application of the central hudson test   the secretary as he did at the preliminary injunction stage and citing the same authorities argues that advertising of securities is not speech and does not implicate the first amendment at all   the court rejects that contention for the same reasons stated in its preliminary injunction decision the plaintiffs raise an argument the court has not previously addressed   citing lorillard tobacco co v reilly  us    plaintiffs argue that regardless of what facts might appear in the record with respect to the interest served by the regulatory scheme and the effectiveness of it in serving that interest a court must strike down a regulation affecting speech unless the government shows that prior to adopting the challenged regulation the regulatory official actually conducted an evaluation of its effect on speech and weighed that effect against alternative less restrictive methods to protect the governmental interest   because the secretary is unable to make such a showing the plaintiffs argue they are entitled to prevailthe court does not read lorillard and the other cases cited as establishing the rule the plaintiffs propose   indeed the supreme court did not actually apply such a standard in lorillard itself   although the record there did not indicate that the massachusetts attorney general had actually conducted a cost benefit analysis before adopting the regulations the court did not treat that failure as determinative   rather the court applied the standards established in central hudson to the evidentiary record developed in the litigation as justification for the regulations  the court applied the same type of analysis a year later in thompson v western states medical center  us    where it considered the legislative history of the statute underlying the challenged regulations but also looked to the justification advanced in the evidentiary record developed in the course of the litigation as well as justifications advanced in briefs before the court   indeed plaintiffs have not identified any case in which a court has struck down regulations on the ground the plaintiffs urge this court to apply based solely on the governments inability to prove that the regulatory authority actually engaged in a balancing process before adopting the regulations without regard to evidence offered in the litigation as to the justification for the regulations the approach the courts have taken in contrast to the one the plaintiffs propose reflects the realities of the regulatory process at the state level which may not involve recorded legislative or regulatory history of the sort compiled at the federal level   it reflects also the presumption of regularity that courts properly grant to acts of the other branches   further the approach the courts have applied avoids the formalistic results that would flow from rulings issued on the basis the plaintiffs propose the court therefore concludes as it did at the preliminary injunction stage that central hudson provides the test by which the court must evaluate the secretarys action  the first step in applying that test is to determine that the commercial speech at issue concerns lawful activity and is not misleading  central hudson  us at    here as stated supra the parties have so stipulatedif the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity the governments power is more circumscribed   the state must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech   moreover the regulatory technique must be in proportion to that interest   the limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the states goal   compliance with this requirement may be measured by two criteria   first the restriction must directly advance the state interest involved  the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the governments purpose   second if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech the excessive restrictions cannot surviveid at    as indicated supra the parties have stipulated to the second prong as well as the first  the governmental interest to be served by the regulations “to protect the integrity of capital markets and thereby to preserve the overall health of the economy by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate material information” is substantial   the dispute centers on the third and fourth prongsbefore addressing the evidence relating to those issues it bears noting that what the parties and other courts have referred to as the third and fourth prongs are not so labeled in central hudson itself   rather central hudson refers to these as criteria by which to measure compliance with the requirement of proportionality   as the supreme court said “the regulatory technique must be in proportion to the substantial state interest asserted   the limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the states goal”   the socalled third and fourth prongs are not independent requirements to be applied mechanically  they are a means of evaluating the proportional relationship between the challenged regulation and the substantial interest it seeks to servethe socalled third prong requires that the restriction “directly advance the state interest involved  the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the governments purpose”   the plaintiffs seize on the word “directly” to argue that the relationship between the regulation and its purpose must be direct in a literal sense in that the effectiveness of the regulation to achieve its goals does not depend on any intermediate steps or incentives   the court does not adopt that interpretation which is not supported either by the language of central hudson or by any other identified authority  central hudson explains the meaning of “direct”  “the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the governments purpose”   the requirement of direct support obligates the government to show that the challenged regulation will not only advance the governments stated interest “but also that it will do so ‘to a material degree’ ”   liquormart inc v rhode island  us    quoting edenfield v fane  us      see also greater new orleans broadcasting assn inc v united states  us    the third prong of the central hudson inquiry “is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture  rather a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree”to establish the effectiveness of the regulatory scheme in issue here the secretary has offered the expert opinion of professor franco   having considered professor francos credentials his reasoning and his demeanor the court finds his opinions wellfounded and highly credible and adopts them in substance   on the issue of effectiveness professor franco emphasizes that the ban on general advertising of unregistered securities must be considered in conjunction with the general requirement of registration which mandates disclosure of all material information about securities offered to the public   the public filing of a registration statement conforming in both form and content to uniform regulatory requirements serves to provide complete balanced and accurate information not only to those who might consider investing in a particular offering but also to the public as a whole including regulatory officials private analysts large investors and the news media whose review serves as a powerful check on the accuracy and completeness of the information provided   that process tends to result in market prices that accurately reflect value for the benefit of all investors both those purchasing the particular issue and those trading in other securities   the ban on general advertising of unregistered securities professor franco opines provides a powerful incentive for issuers to register despite the substantial costs of doing so thereby maximizing the benefits of the registration system to the public as a whole  indeed in his view it is vital to the effectiveness of the registration system   the court adopts this opinion and so finds  it follows that the ban on general solicitation of unregistered securities effectively promotes registration which in turn effectively serves the state interest in market integrity   professor franco does not purport to quantify the effectiveness of the regulatory scheme and the court is not in a position to do so   the case law does not establish a precise level of effectiveness that must be achieved  central hudson indicates only that the regulation must effect something more than “remote” support for the state interest served   the court is satisfied that that standard is met herethe court therefore turns to the fourth prong of the central hudson test  whether “the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech”   the phrase “as well” bears noting  the test is not whether some less restrictive approach might also serve the states interest but whether it would do so as well as the challenged regulation   central hudson does not elaborate on what is meant by “as well”   the court construes the phrase as referring to effectiveness in relation to the cost and burden of the regulatory scheme to the publicthat is could a less restrictive regulatory approach serve the state interest as effectively at the same or approximately the same cost both in public resources expended for administration and enforcement and in private resources required for complianceto satisfy the fourth prong of the central hudson inquiry the government must show “a fit that is not necessarily perfect but reasonable  that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but ․ a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective”  florida bar v went for it  us at    in evaluating the “fit” courts have been “loath to secondguess the governments judgment” relying on the states judgment “so long as its judgment was reasonable”   board of trustees  us at    that deference serves to “provide the legislative and executive branches needed leeway in a field commercial speech ‘traditionally subject to governmental regulation’ ”  id at  quoting ohralik  us at    see board of trustees  us at  “by declining to impose ․ a leastrestrictivemeans requirement we take account of the difficulty of establishing with precision the point at which restrictions become more restrictive than their objective requires and provide the legislative and executive branches needed leeway in a field ․ traditionally subject to governmental regulation”“a regulation need not be absolutely the least severe that will achieve the desired end but if there are numerous and obvious lessburdensome alternatives to the restriction on commercial speech that is certainly a relevant consideration in determining whether the fit between ends and means is reasonable”  cincinnati v discovery network inc  us   n  internal quotation omitted  “if the government could achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict speech or that restricts less speech the government must do so”  thompson v western states med ctr  us at   see lorillard tobacco co  us at    what is required is that “the regulation not ‘burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the governments legitimate interests’ ”  board of trustees  us at  quoting ward v rock against racism  us   the court also keeps in mind that the crux of the overall scheme established by both the state and federal securities laws is the requirement of registration   registration serves not to restrict speech but to expand it by ensuring that any public offer to sell securities is accompanied by full disclosure of all material information   see ralston purina us at  n  quoting preamble to federal securities act of  “an act to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce ․ and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof”  see also wall street pub inst  fd at    disclosure requirements “trench much more narrowly on an advertisers interests than do flat prohibitions on speech”  zauderer  us at    for that reason the high court has held “an advertisers rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the states interest in preventing deception of consumers”  id see florida bar v went for it  us at  remarking on the “many alternative channels” available to commercial speakersto evaluate the eleven alternative approaches the plaintiffs propose the secretary again offers professor francos opinions   as professor franco explained the plaintiffs proposals overlap   all of them would eliminate the prohibition on general advertising of unregistered securities   some would replace it with provisions of various kinds that would focus on the point of sale such as requirements of notice of sales to the secretary of state and of a right to rescind within a specified time  increased requirements of verification documentation and record keeping to confirm accredited status of purchasers  licensing of accredited investors  and the like   others offer no regulatory replacement proposing merely more intensive enforcement of antifraud prohibitions or of prohibitions on sales to unaccredited investorsin professor francos view all of the plaintiffs proposals would reduce the incentive to register and encourage issuers to make unregistered offerings sacrificing lawful access to some potential buyers in favor of saving the costs of registration   in addition all of the proposals would likely result in increased “distortive” that is unbalanced communications increased incidence of unlawful transactions such as sales to unaccredited investors and proliferation of scams   those proposals that rely on increased enforcement activity in connection with sales would suffer from the problem of coming after rather than before transactions when dissipation of assets may prevent effective remedies   in addition proposals requiring increased enforcement to be effective would require expenditure of increased public resources   some would also raise issues of federal preemption to the extent that they are inconsistent with the existing federal scheme of securities regulation   in all of these respects professor franco opined the plaintiffs proposals would decrease the protection of investors and impair market integrity   for the reasons already explained the court credits professor francos opinions   on that basis the court finds that none of the proposed alternatives would serve the governmental interest in market integrity as well as the existing regulatory schemeto counter professor francos opinions the plaintiffs rely on two documents submitted as stipulated exhibits at trial  a report to the securities and exchange commission sec from its advisory committee on smaller public companies dated april    and a letter to the sec dated april   from the committee on securities regulation of the new york city bar commenting on an “exposure draft” of that report   the advisory committee report recommends to the sec that it relax prohibitions on general solicitation and advertising in certain respects   the new york city bar expresses support for that recommendation  both documents identify the rationale and purpose for the authors position as the promotion of capital formationcapital formation is of course an important goal which is to some degree in tension with investor protection and market integrity   regulatory constraints that protect market integrity impose burdens on issuers and sellers of securities   in that respect they may tend to impede capital formation   it follows that relaxation of such regulatory restraints might ease capital formation   the state regulatory scheme in issue here and the corresponding federal scheme reflect a regulatory choice to emphasize market integrity over capital formation   this court has no authority to secondguess that choice   rather once it has been established as it has been here by stipulation that the interest the regulator seeks to serve is a substantial one the courts role is to determine whether the means the secretary has chosen to effectuate that choice is proportional to that interest as measured by the criteria articulated in central hudson   neither the advisory committees report nor the new york city bars letter purports to address that issue and neither sheds any light on itthe court concludes based on the stipulated facts and the evidence presented at trial that the statute and regulations in issue and the secretarys enforcement action against bulldog investors meet the test of central hudson and do not violate the first amendment rights either of bulldog or of mr bloness   a declaration will enter to that effect   conclusion and orderfor the reasons stated the court orders that judgment enter for the defendant declaring that the challenged statute regulations and enforcement action do not violate the plaintiffs rights under the first amendment   counsel are directed to submit a proposed form of judgment forthwithfootnotesfn the court has also issued a memorandum of decision and entered final judgment in a related action no   bls the plaintiffs petition for judicial review of the secretarys final

additional materials including information about the funds’ investment strategy and philosophy the backgrounds of their managers performance and recent successes and news articles samuels’s email

happy to spend a few minutes on the phone if you wish to discuss in more detail please contact me at” a telephone number provided among the materials samuels attached to his email to hickey was one item that is the subject of considerable argument among the parties here a copy of a letter dated july   directed to investors in bulldog’s funds the letter discusses the funds’ returns as compared to the standard  poor  index current investments in particular companies and a lawsuit against the sec challenging a rule requiring registration of certain hedge fund managers it then states we don’t need a nanny regulator to tell us right from wrong and unlike most mutual fund managers we put our money where our mouths are since day one a significant portion of our net worth has been invested in full value partners so you can be sure that our interests are closely aligned with yours in our opinion that is more important than all the cosmetic rules and regulations any regulator can dream up on january   the enforcement section of the massachusetts securities division filed an administrative complaint with the acting director of the securities division against bulldog investors alleging that bulldog had offered securities for sale in the commonwealth that were not properly registered or exempt in violation of g l c a the massachusetts uniform securities act and regulations thereunder  c m r §  et seq by means of the communications appearing in the website the enforcement section sought a cease and desist order an administrative fine and other relief bulldog investors answered the administrative complaint on february   denying the allegations and raising as a defense the allegation that the complaint abridged its rights under the first amendment to the united states constitution and article xvi of the massachusetts declaration of rights on march   while the administrative proceeding was pending the plaintiffs filed this action the complaint in this court names secretary of the commonwealth william galvin and chief of enforcement patrick ahearn the complaint alleges that the conduct that forms the basis of the administrative complaint is “protected by the free speech and free press guarantees in the first amendment to the constitution of the united states and article xvi of the massachusetts declaration of rights” and that the administrative proceeding chills the exercise of those rights in that “but for the threat of sanctions and the litigation burden imposed by the secretary the bulldog investors website would continue to operate as it did prior to the secretary’s action” the complaint asserts claims under the federal and state civil rights acts  u s c §  and g l c  § i and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief including a preliminary injunction contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction the court gants j declined to hear the motion at that time preferring to await the secretary’s action on the pending administrative complaint when the administrative complaint remained pending several months later after proceedings on crossmotions for summary disposition the plaintiffs in this action renewed their request for preliminary injunctive relief and the court set a briefing schedule and scheduled a hearing for october   on october   the acting director of the securities division issued a final order on behalf of the secretary concluding the administrative proceeding the court held a hearing on october   as scheduled in light of the secretary’s issuance of the final order the court at that time granted all parties’ request for leave to file supplemental memoranda which the court received on november   the plaintiffs now direct their request for a preliminary injunction toward enforcement of the final order as well as any further effort at enforcement by the secretary’s enforcement section their supplemental memoranda add a commerce clause theory to the first amendment claim originally raised the secretary’s final order adopted the hearing officer’s findings of fact as set forth supra as well as her rulings of law in substance as follows the massachusetts securities act g l c a §  makes it unlawful for any person to offer securities for sale in the commonwealth unless the securities are registered the transaction is exempt or the security is “federally covered” the act defines an offer to sell to include “every attempt or offer to dispose of or solicitation of an offer to buy a security or interest in a security for value” g l c a §  the act further provides that it should be construed so as to coordinate its interpretation and administration consistently with federal securities law g l c  a §  under federal case law and sec decisions an offer extends beyond the common law contract concept to include information that “conditions the public interest in particular securities” see sec v cavanaugh  fd   d cir  and carl m loeb rhodes  co  s e c    under that definition the hearing officer ruled “it is clear respondents have offered securities for sale in the commonwealth” by disseminating the information on the website in combination with the email communication directed to mr hickey citing sec decisions the hearing officer rejected the contention that the website material did not constitute an offer because a visitor to the site who sought specific information about funds would have to register indicating agreement to the disclaimer the hearing officer went on to rule that bulldog had not proved that it was exempt from registration requirements the only exemption invoked was that under  c m r § bm which exempts offers communicated through the internet if not “directed toward any investor or group of investors in the commonwealth”and presumes that such an offer is not so directed if it “contains indications that the offer is not being made in jurisdictions where it is not registered or appropriately exempted” that exemption did not apply the hearing officer ruled because of the email with attached material directed specifically at a massachusetts resident the hearing officer also ruled that bulldog’s activities were not exempt under other specified regulatory provisions that condition exemption on compliance with a ban on general advertising based on those findings and rulings the securities division ordered that bulldog cease and desist from further violations comply with the act and pay an administrative fine of  the securities division stayed the imposition of sanctions pending this court’s ruling on the motion for preliminary injunction affidavits submitted by the plaintiffs provide certain additional background information leonard bloness asserts that he has “no intention ever to invest in any hedge fund” but is interested in learning about hedge funds “as a part of the process of striving to be a well educated investor” he is interested in bulldog investors in particular because “bulldog’s managers employ investment strategies that are somewhat similar” to his so that information about bulldog assists him in carrying out those strategies in his view the statement that fund managers’ investment in the funds they manage “closely aligns” their interests with those of investors is “well accepted” and not misleading further he asserts he is fully competent to analyze the accuracy of the information presented and has no need for regulatory protection from such statements discussion under the wellestablished test of packaging indus group v cheney  mass    a preliminary injunction is warranted only when the moving party establishes both a likelihood of success on the merits of the claim and a substantial risk of irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction if both those factors are established the court must balance them against the harm that an injunction will inflict on the opposing party id where as here the opposing party is a public official performing a regulatory function for the protection of the public the court must also carefully consider the impact an injunction would have on the public interest see trinel mgmt inc v board of health of barnstable  mass    t  d video inc v city of revere  mass    the court thus begins the analysis with the issue of likelihood of success on the merits of the claims pled in the complaint that the massachusetts securities act on its face and as applied to bulldog’s conduct in connection with its website and email communication violates the federal and state civil rights acts by infringing on free speech rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions  the parties have focused their attention on the federal claim and the court will do the same at the outset it bears noting that the plaintiffs have not identified any court decision at any level striking down on first amendment grounds any statute regulation or application of either with respect to the conduct of issuers in offering or advertising securities to the contrary the united states supreme court has on a number of occasions cited the securities area as an example of speech regulation that does not violate the first amendment see dun  bradstreet inc v greenmoss builders  u s   n   ohralik v ohio state bar ass’n  u s    paris adult theater i v slaton  u s    see also national association for adv of psychoanalysis v california bd of psych  fd   th cir  securities  exchange commission v wall street pub inst inc  fd   d c cir  bangor  arrostook rr company v interstate commerce comm’n  fd   st cir  european connections  tours inc v gonzales  f supp d   n d ga  see generally michael siebecker corporate speech securities regulation and an institutional approach to the first amendment  william  mary l rev     these statements are dicta to be sure the high court has not yet directly confronted the question presented here that the court has repeatedly stated its assumption to that effect however provides strong guidance to this court in its task of predicting how appellate courts will resolve the question see schwab v crosby  fd   th cir  harbury v dench  fd   d d c  the first amendment analysis must begin with a determination of the nature of the conduct affected by the regulation – that is is the conduct speech and if so what kind commercial or noncommercial the plaintiffs contend that the communications in issue are noncommercial speech because they do not propose any commercial transaction they also point to the comment quoted supra in the letter which they characterize as political speech defendants argue that the conduct in issue is not speech at all but is merely incidental to a regulable transaction that is the sale of securities see lowe  u s at  “offer and acceptance are communications incidental to the regulable transaction called a contract” the court is not persuaded by either of these arguments review of the website materials and email attachments leaves no doubt that they are neither acts of offer and acceptance in a direct contract sense nor merely information about hedge funds in general or bulldog funds in particular rather they are in the nature of advertising calculated to generate interest in investment in bulldog’s funds directly analogous to the advertising in issue in virginia pharmacy bd v virginia citizens consumer council  u s    that such communications constitute offering within the broad definition of the securities laws does not in itself make them action as opposed to expression for purposes of the first amendment the nature of the expression involved here however is clearly commercial in the sense that the expression is “related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience” central hudson gas  elec v public serv comm’n  u s    that is true of the comment in the letter as well as the other materials the inclusion of political commentary in otherwise commercially oriented speech does not change its fundamental character see board of trustees state univ of n y v fox  u s    zauderer v office of disciplinary counsel  u s   n   bolger v drugs products corp  u s    after a period of considerable uncertainty on the point a series of united states supreme court decisions has established that the first amendment “protects commercial speech from unwarranted governmental regulation” see central hudson  u s at  citing virginia pharm bd  u s at  however “the constitution    accords a lesser protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression     the protection available for particular commercial expression turns on the nature both of the expression and of the governmental interests served by its regulation” central hudson  u s at  internal citation omitted the court has established a four part test to evaluate restrictions on commercial speech first a reviewing court must consider whether the speech provides truthful information about lawful activity “there can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity the government may ban forms of communication more likely to deceive the public than to inform it    or commercial speech related to illegal activity” id at  citations omitted from there the analysis proceeds as follows if the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity the government’s power is more circumscribed the state must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech moreover the regulatory technique must be in proportion to that interest the limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the state’s goal compliance with this requirement may be measured by two criteria first the restriction must directly advance the state interest involved the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government’s purpose second if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech the excessive restrictions cannot survive id at  the supreme court reaffirmed this fourpart test just a few years ago in lorillard tobacco co v reilly  u s    defendants argue both that the speech relates to unlawful activity and that it is misleading on the issue of unlawful activity defendants point out that sales of unregistered securities to unaccredited investors not subject to any other exemption would violate federal law  usc §e in the absence of any evidence either way they urge the court to assume that mr hickey is not an accredited investor so that advertising to him was communication about a sale that would be unlawful the court is not persuaded on this point the communications in issue certainly appear designed to elicit interest in investing among the public generally but their content does not address investing by unaccredited investors operation of hedge funds and investment in them is not unlawful as a general matter defendants argue that the statement in the letter to investors that “our interests are closely aligned with yours” is misleading they base that contention on goldstein v sec  fd   d c cir  in that case brought by one of the bulldog plaintiffs in this case the court held that investors in a hedge fund are not clients of the fund’s advisor for purposes of a rule under which exemption from registration depends on the number of the advisor’s clients if investors were clients the court reasoned fund advisors would be subject to conflicting duties because investors’ interests would depart from those of the fund in circumstances of financial distress id  fd at  the goldstein decision recognizes that the interests of fund advisers and investors can depart under certain circumstances the letter does not say otherwise the point it expresses is that bulldog’s fund advisors are themselves investors in the fund so that they share the interests of other investors in the fund’s performance fuller disclosure might lend context to that statement and prevent any exaggerated interpretation of it but nothing before the court indicates that the statement itself is untrue the court is not persuaded that the statement contained in the letter is misleading in the sense that would deprive it of first amendment protection under central hudson since the information communicated has not been shown to be either misleading or related to unlawful activity the court must turn to the second step of the central hudson analysis which involves consideration of the interest the state seeks to serve by the regulation that interest is to protect the integrity of capital markets and thereby to preserve the overall health of the economy by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate material information the great depression brought home the importance of the interest by demonstrating the catastrophic consequences of the absence of effective regulation in this area in its wake congress enacted the federal securities act of  and states enacted various corresponding provisions see sec v capital gains research bureau inc  u s    s e c v ralston purina co  u s    in the matter of carl m loeb rhoades  co  s e c at  smith v fishback  swd   tex civ app  in re leach  cal    stewart v brady  ill    kneeland v emerton  mass at  see also merrick v halsey  co  u s    hall v geigerjones company  u s    the massachusetts securities act tracks the federal act and seeks to serve the same purposes compare g l c a §  with  usc § e compare g l c a §  with  usc §b see also g l c a §  the decisions cited supra which refer to securities regulation as the quintessential example of justified speech regulation unequivocally recognize the substantiality of the interests served see dun  bradstreet inc  u s at  n  ohralik  mass u s at  paris adult theater i  u s at  sec v wall street pub inst inc  fd at  bangor  arrostook rr co  f d at  since the regulation serves a substantial governmental interest the court must next consider the third and fourth prongs of the central hudson test which together determine whether the regulation is “in proportion to that interest” these prongs ask whether the regulation directly advances the state interest and whether the interest “could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech    ”  us at  as to the third prong the interest again is to protect the integrity of the capital markets and the overall health of the economy by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate disclosure of all material information the regulations in issue serve that interest directly by prohibiting any public offering without registration subject to narrow exemptions see g l c a §  as applied here the regulation prohibits expression that although not in the form of an express offer tends to promote interest in investment and thereby to invite offers to purchase prohibition of such expression serves to limit solicitation of offers to those who have made full disclosure in connection with registration and thereby directly serves the interests in issue the fourth prong of the central hudson test is the most difficult to apply here under that prong the court must determine whether the regulatory restrictions are narrowly tailored to serve the state interest “if the government could achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict speech or that restricts less speech the government must do so” thompson v western states med ctr  u s    see lorillard tobacco co  u s at  the test is not however one of least restrictive means see board of trustees state univ of n y  u s at  what is required rather is that “the regulation not ‘burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government’s legitimate interests’” id at  quoting ward v rock against racism  u s    there must be “a ‘fit’ between the legislature’s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends’   a fit that is not necessarily perfect but reasonable that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is ‘in proportion to the interest served’” board of trustees  u s at  quoting posadas de puerto rico assocs v tourism co of puerto rico  u s    and in re r m j  u s    in evaluating the “fit” the court has been “loath to secondguess the government’s judgment” relying on the state’s judgment “so long as its judgment was reasonable” board of trustees  u s at  that deference serves to “provide the legislative and executive branches needed leeway in a field commercial speech ‘traditionally subject to governmental regulation’” id at  quoting ohralik  u s at  the burden to prove the fit between the regulation and the interest served is on the regulator see board of trustees  u s at  at the stage of a preliminary injunction however the court is not in the position of evaluating evidence and making ultimate findings as it would do after trial but is rather predicting the likelihood that the regulator will be able to make the required showing in making that prediction the court can properly consider the longstanding and widespread recognition as expressed in the cases cited supra of the importance of regulation of the offering and sale of securities in protecting the health of the capital markets and of the economy the court also keeps in mind that the crux of the overall scheme established by both the state and federal securities laws is the requirement of registration registration serves not to restrict speech but to expand it by ensuring that any public offer to sell securities is accompanied by full disclosure of all material information see ralston purina  us at  n  quoting preamble to federal securities act of  “an act to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce    and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof” see also wall street pub inst  fd at  disclosure requirements “trench much more narrowly on an advertiser’s interests than do flat prohibitions on speech” zauderer  u s at  for that reason the high court has held “an advertiser’s rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the state’s interest in preventing deception of consumers” id see also pharmaceutical care mgmt ass’n v rowe  fd   st cir  the necessary corollary to the registration and disclosure requirement is the prohibition of public offering of unregistered securities prohibitions on public offering inherently restrict speech but without such prohibitions it is difficult to imagine how a registration and disclosure system could operate with any degree of effectiveness see kneeland  mass at  here the particular regulatory order in issue sanctions advertising unregistered securities to the public including to a massachusetts resident not shown to be an accredited investor the order fits directly within the longstanding norm of securities regulation that courts have consistently accepted as permissible bulldog emphasizes that its website did not provide a mechanism through which one could make an actual investment transaction and that it has not and “would not” sell other than to investors who certify their accredited status that may be so but the state is not required simply to take bulldog’s word for it it is certainly reasonable to conclude that indiscriminate advertising to the general public tends to increase the likelihood of sales to ineligible persons who may be persuaded to invest without the full information that registration would provide bulldog suggests that the state could achieve its objective with less burden on speech by monitoring actual investments including requiring documentation of eligibility subject to audit by regulatory officials or even by requiring verification by regulatory officials prior to investment transactions how such a system would operate in practice is not apparent at the least it would require that the issuer register with regulatory authorities give notice of actual or proposed investments and refrain from any transactions without registration and notice the result would seem to be more rather than less burden on speech a more fully developed record may lead to a different conclusion at this stage however the court is of the view that the regulatory order in issue here is reasonably proportional to the interests to be served by the regulatory scheme and accordingly that the plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their first amendment claim as indicated supra the plaintiffs’ supplemental memoranda adds a second theory not identified in the complaint that the massachusetts regulations violate the commerce clause they invoke the socalled “dormant” aspect of the commerce clause which prohibits state regulation that “discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce and thereby ‘impedes free private trade in the national marketplace’” gen motors corp v tracy  u s    quoting reeves inc v stake  u s    by analogy to cases addressing regulation of internet transmission of sexually explicit materials plaintiffs argue that regulation of bulldog’s website necessarily regulates commerce in other states see american booksellers foundation v dean  f d   d cir  psinet inc v chapman  f d   th cir  invoking the balancing test applied in those cases they urge the court to conclude that the burden on interstate commerce outweighs any benefit to massachusetts residents from the regulation plaintiffs’ theory fails because neither the regulation itself nor the secretary’s application of it in the final order attempts to regulate bulldog’s website in and of itself rather the final order is based on the combination of the website and the direct email communication to a massachusetts resident as indicated supra the regulation  c m r § b excludes internet offers not “directed toward any investor or group of investors in the commonwealth” the regulation establishes a presumption that an offer is not directed to residents if it “contains indications” that it is “not being made in jurisdictions where it is not registered or appropriately exempted” the direct email communication with mr hickey rebutted that presumption regulation of email sent into a state has been held not to implicate the dormant commerce clause where federal law authorizes state regulation in the area see beyond systems inc v keynetics inc  f supp d   d md  and cases cited here as in that case congress has expressly authorized state regulation in the field  u s c § pe provides that state securities regulators “shall retain jurisdiction    to investigate and bring enforcement actions” see also northeast bancorp inc v board of governors  us    “when congress so chooses state actions which it plainly authorizes are invulnerable to constitutional attack under the commerce clause” bulldog bases its argument not on the secretary’s actual decision but on recommended findings submitted to the hearing officer by the enforcement section and on the theoretical possibility that at some time in the future the enforcement section would seek and the secretary would order sanctions based on the website alone in this respect what bulldog seeks is essentially an advisory opinion on a matter of federal constitutional law not involving freedom of speech such relief is not available by means of a preliminary injunction bulldog has not established a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims the court therefore has no occasion to address the other aspects of the test for a preliminary injunction the motion must be denied conclusion and order for the reasons stated the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction is denied the court will conduct a status conference at the earliest available date to set a schedule for future proceedings counsel are directed to confer with each other and then contact the clerk to set a date

point that each is named solely in his official capacity the complaint does not include any prayer for monetary relief other than attorney’s fees the plaintiffs have recently moved for leave to file an amended complaint that would add claims for damages the court denies that motion in a separate order issued this date the defendants have not controverted the assertions in the plaintiffs’ affidavits although the court is informed that bulldog has brought a separate action for judicial review of the final order pursuant to g l c a §  bulldog has not argued in this case that the final order is based on any error in interpretation or application of any state or federal statute or regulation or on any erroneous factual finding the court therefore takes as established the secretary’s ruling that bulldog’s operation of the website combined with the email communication to brendan hickey violated g l c a and regulations under it as well as corresponding federal regulations the defendants’ answers challenge bloness’s standing but not that of the list of parties referred to herein collectively as bulldog under these circumstances the court need not determine bloness’s standing at this stage mass redemption coalition inc v secretary of the exec office of envir affairs  mass app ct   n  citing mass teachers ass’n v secretary of the commonwealth  mass    “where at least one plaintiff has standing to raise issues before the court the standing of other plaintiffs need not be addressed” the only argument the plaintiffs offer under the massachusetts declaration of rights is the suggestion that “article xvi    can and should be interpreted to provide greater protection to free speech than the first amendment” for this proposition the plaintiffs cite mendoza v licensing bd of fall river  mass    which applied art xvi to strike down a prohibition on nude dancing similar to one the united states supreme court had upheld under the first amendment the plaintiffs do not cite any massachusetts authority relating to regulation of commercial speech or speech in any area otherwise analogous to that involved here nor have they identified any case suggesting any other infirmity in the massachusetts securities act under the declaration of rights the supreme judicial court long ago rejected a challenge to the statute under article  see kneeland v emerton  mass    the court notes further that the facts presented here appear to fall short of the element of threats intimidation or coercion required for a claim under the state civil rights act see generally haufler v zotos  mass    and cases cited the plaintiffs cite a line of cases applying first amendment protections to publication of opinions by commentators and analysts who are not issuers of securities and do not advise individual investors eg lowe v s e c  u s    commodity trend serv v commodity futures trading comm’n  fd   th cir  s e c v wall st pub inst inc  fd   d c cir  taucher v

contributions a similar statement appears in the printable brochure that was accessible on the website disclosure that might be pertinent would include for example exactly what is meant by “a significant portion of our net worth” so as to enable a potential investor in bulldog’s funds to evaluate the extent to which the interests of its advisors really are aligned with those of the investor bulldog identifies the regulatory interest as preventing sales to unaccredited investors and argues that the regulation does not address that interest directly since it applies to communications that are remote from any such sale this mistakes the interest at stake which goes well beyond accredited investors the registration requirement ensures fully informed decision making by investors generally and thereby serves the broad interest in the integrity of the capital markets sales to accredited investors are a narrow exception to the registration requirement under which unregistered securities may be sold privately to a narrow and carefully selected category of purchasers without the safeguards deemed necessary for the benefit of the public as a whole cf stamm v

spina cowin cordy  gants jj  andrew good philip g cormier with him for the plaintiffs pierce o cray assistant attorney general peter w cassidy with him for the defendant cowin j a hearing officer in the securities division division of the office of the secretary of the commonwealth secretary found that the plaintiffs violated g l c a the massachusetts uniform securities act act by offering unregistered securities to a massachusetts resident via electronic mail email the plaintiffs sought judicial review of this ruling and a judge in the superior court affirmed the plaintiffs contend that their contacts with the commonwealth were insufficient to permit the secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over them that the act violates their constitutional right to free speech and that the communication did not constitute an offer within the meaning of the act we conclude that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consistent with due process that the constitutional claim is not properly before us and that the secretary determined correctly that the plaintiffs violated the act unlike at common law where the definition of an offer includes only communications to which an offerees affirmative response would conclude a bargain the act defines an offer more broadly to include the solicitation of an offer see g l c a §  i  thus the plaintiffs violated the act by sending to a massachusetts resident materials soliciting an offer to purchase unregistered securities  facts and procedural history we summarize the facts found by the

message to which documents were attached that contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs hedge funds the returns the funds had earned background information on bulldogs partners news articles about the funds and a description of the plaintiffs investment philosophy and strategy samuels also invited hickey to contact him by telephone to discuss bulldogs funds in greater detail on january   the secretary filed an administrative complaint against the plaintiffs alleging that bulldogs web site and email contact with hickey constituted an offer of securities that were neither registered nor exempt from registration in violation of the act see g l c a §  in their answer the plaintiffs denied violating the act and asserted as affirmative defenses  that the act and the secretarys regulations violated the plaintiffs right to free speech under the first amendment to the united states constitution and art  of the massachusetts declaration of rights and  that in any event the secretary lacked personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs the secretary appointed a hearing officer pursuant to  code mass regs § b  the secretary moved for summary decision arguing that the hearing officer lacked the authority to decide the plaintiffs constitutional claims in response the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the superior court pursuant to  usc §  and g l c  § i asserting their constitutional claim regarding free speech the plaintiffs sought a stay of the administrative proceeding  pending resolution of the first amendment claim in the superior court the hearing officer denied the request she stated that the only issue before her was whether the plaintiffs violated the act and that she was required to make a finding regarding liability before a court could decide whether there had been an abridgement of the plaintiffs first amendment right the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs had offered unregistered securities for sale in the commonwealth in addition she determined that the plaintiffs did not qualify for various exemptions to the registration requirement finally the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs were subject to personal jurisdiction in massachusetts because their violation of the act constituted a sufficient nexus to permit personal jurisdiction she recommended the issuance of a cease and desist order and a  fine the acting director of the securities division acting director adopted the hearing officers recommended findings of fact and rulings of law and imposed the recommended sanctions the plaintiffs sought judicial review of the acting directors determination in the superior court and moved for judgment on the pleadings see g l c a §  g l c a §  see also standing order  of the rules of the superior court  a claim for judicial review shall be resolved through a motion for judgment on the pleadings  in a thoughtful memorandum of decision a judge in the superior court denied the motion and affirmed the acting directors ruling the judge concluded that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consonant with due process in addition she held that after having chosen to use the separate   usc §  action as the vehicle to obtain relief on their first amendment claim the plaintiffs could not raise that claim in the action pursuant to g l c a §  the plaintiffs appealed and we transferred the case from the appeals court on our own motion  standard of review pursuant to g l c a §  any person aggrieved by a final decision of the secretary in an adjudicatory proceeding may obtain judicial review see g l c a §  we reverse the secretarys decision only if it was a in violation of constitutional provisions b in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the secretary c based upon an error of law d made upon unlawful procedure e unsupported by substantial evidence f unwarranted by facts found by the court  where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact or g arbitrary or capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law see g l c a §    discussion the plaintiffs contend that the web site and the single email message to hickey were insufficient contacts with the commonwealth to subject them to personal jurisdiction before the secretary they claim that the act does not authorize the secretary to subject nonresidents to administrative enforcement proceedings furthermore they argue that exercising personal jurisdiction in this case violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution because the plaintiffs did not purposefully avail themselves of the benefits of massachusetts law the plaintiffs contend also that the secretarys order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful nonmisleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction in violation of the first amendment and art  they argue in addition that their web site and email message did not constitute an offer within the meaning of the act see g l c a §  i  they contend that the communication to hickey was not an offer because he could not have purchased securities merely by responding to the email message in addition they contend that hickey agreed to a disclaimer posted on the web site stating that the information contained therein did not constitute a solicitation  the secretary responds that the broad enforcement powers granted him under the act authorized personal jurisdiction in this case he argues also that his exercise of jurisdiction comported with due process because the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in massachusetts furthermore he contends that they could have reasonably anticipated being the subject of an enforcement proceeding by virtue of their violation of the act additionally the secretary contends that the plaintiffs first amendment claim is waived and that even if not waived the claim fails because there is no constitutional prohibition on requiring that a seller of securities disclose information about its products through registration before being allowed to offer or advertise them finally the secretary argues that the plaintiffs communication with hickey constituted a solicitation that falls within the acts definition of an offer he notes that the acts definition of the term offer is not limited to its commonlaw definition a personal jurisdiction for a nonresident to be subject to personal jurisdiction in massachusetts there must be a statute authorizing jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction must be consistent with basic due process requirements mandated by the united states constitution intech inc v triple c marine salvage inc  mass    quoting tatro v manor care inc  mass    we analyze each requirement separately i statutory authorization of personal jurisdiction in court proceedings personal jurisdiction in massachusetts over a nonresident is authorized when one of the provisions of our longarm statute g l c a §  is satisfied see roberts v legendary marine sales  mass    by its terms the longarm statute applies only to courts and cannot authorize an agency to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents see g l c a §  however the longarm statute is not the only source for the exercise of personal jurisdiction  over nonresidents the text and purposes of the act itself establish that it authorizes the secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents in an administrative proceeding the act prohibits the offering or selling of unregistered securities in the commonwealth unless the securities are exempt from the registration requirement or are federal covered securities see g l c a §  the definition of offer includes not only offers that originate within the commonwealth but also ones directed into the commonwealth and received at the place to which they are directed see g l c a §  c the secretary possesses the authority to conduct investigations inside or outside the commonwealth to determine if a violation has occurred see g l c a §  a he also has broad authority to remedy a violation of any provision of the act by any person by imposing cease and desist orders or fines see g l c a § a a these provisions establish that one of the purposes of the act is to protect massachusetts residents from offers and sales of unregistered securities directed at them from other jurisdictions these protections and the secretarys authority to conduct investigations outside the commonwealth would be meaningless without authorization to subject nonresidents to enforcement proceedings furthermore the act provides that where personal jurisdiction cannot otherwise be obtained in the commonwealth any nonresident who has violated the act is deemed to have appointed the secretary as his agent to receive process in any noncriminal proceeding arising out of that conduct see g l c a §  h this authority to serve process would be ineffective in enforcing the act through administrative proceedings unless accompanied by the power to bring a respondent before a tribunal to adjudicate whether a violation occurred interpreting the statute to authorize service of process without authorizing personal jurisdiction would transform the substituted service provision into a nullity see flemings v contributory retirement appeal bd  mass    if a sensible construction is available we shall not construe a statute  to make a nullity of pertinent provisions or to produce absurd results ii due process the constitutional touchstone of the determination whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process remains whether the defendant established minimum contacts in the forum state tatro v manor care inc  mass    quoting burger king corp v rudzewicz  us    the due process analysis entails three requirements first minimum contacts must arise from some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws tatro v manor care inc supra quoting asahi metal indus co v superior court  us    second the claim must arise out of or relate to the defendants contacts with the forum see tatro v manor care inc supra third the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant must not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice tatro v manor care inc supra at  quoting international shoe co v washington  us    by contacting hickey the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business activities in massachusetts and invoked the protection of massachusetts law see tatro v manor care inc supra solicitation of business in massachusetts invokes benefits and protection of massachusetts law because the plaintiffs operated a web site accessible in massachusetts and sent a solicitation that is prohibited by massachusetts law to a massachusetts resident it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to anticipate being held responsible in massachusetts  see worldwide volkswagen corp v woodson  us    the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis  is whether the defendants conduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there at the time of their communication with hickey the plaintiffs were on notice that hickey was a resident of massachusetts additionally the act placed the plaintiffs on notice that directing offers of unregistered securities into massachusetts is unlawful see g l c a §§   a c by soliciting purchases of their hedge funds the plaintiffs sought to derive commercial benefit from their interaction with hickey therefore it would be unfair to escape having to account in massachusetts for consequences that arise proximately from such activities burger king corp v rudzewicz supra at  the plaintiffs suggest that we have ruled in prior cases that contacts more substantial than those existing here were insufficient to sustain personal jurisdiction see roberts v legendary marine sales inc  mass     droukas v divers training academy inc  mass     these cases are inapposite because they considered only whether personal jurisdiction was statutorily authorized by the longarm statute they did not address the due process question the second and third prongs of the due process analysis are also satisfied in this case it is undisputed that the secretarys enforcement proceedings arose out of the plaintiffs contacts with massachusetts finally exercising personal jurisdiction in these circumstances comports with fair play and substantial justice in determining whether fair play and substantial justice are satisfied we weigh the commonwealths interest in adjudicating the dispute the burden on the outofstate party of litigating in massachusetts and the commonwealths interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief see burger king corp v rudzewicz supra at  massachusetts has a strong interest in adjudicating violations of massachusetts securities law see tatro v manor care inc supra although there may be some inconvenience to the plaintiffs in litigating in massachusetts such inconvenience does not outweigh the commonwealths interest in enforcing its laws in a massachusetts forum  the plaintiffs contend that even if the secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over bulldog he could not exert personal jurisdiction over the individual plaintiffs the secretary has the burden of proving facts sufficient to establish that personal jurisdiction is permissible see miller v miller  mass    because the facts in the record are sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over each individual plaintiff that burden has been met here in the administrative complaint the secretary alleged that hickey was sent advertising and offering materials through email in their answer to the administrative complaint each individual plaintiff admitted that he provided information via email to hickey while some of the individual plaintiffs later filed affidavits stating that they were not involved in sending this communication the secretary was entitled to credit the facts admitted in the answer rather than the affidavits see walker v georgetown housing auth  mass   n  because each individual plaintiff admitted to facts sufficient to form a basis for personal jurisdiction the secretarys finding that he possessed personal jurisdiction over all the plaintiffs is supported by substantial evidence b first amendment claim the plaintiffs argue that the secretarys order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful nonmisleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction the secretary contends that the plaintiffs first amendment claim has been waived and that even if it has not been waived the cease and desist order and the act itself do not violate the constitutional protection of freedom of speech the plaintiffs initially asserted their first amendment defense in their answer to the administrative complaint the hearing  officer declined to rule on this issue instead she agreed that the constitutional defense should be decided by a court the hearing officer apparently viewed the constitutional claim as a challenge to the enabling statute and as such beyond the authority of the secretary to adjudicate see gurry v board of public accountancy  mass    in response to the hearing officers position the plaintiffs litigated the first amendment issue in a separate action in the superior court in which they asserted violations of  usc §  the plaintiffs did not raise the first amendment issue in their complaint for judicial review in the instant case brought pursuant to g l c a §  they did plead the issue and litigate it in the  usc §  action in these unusual circumstances the  usc §  action is the proper forum for resolving the plaintiffs first amendment claim c violation of the act the secretary determined properly that the plaintiffs email message to hickey violated the act the act defines an offer to include the solicitation of an offer see g l c a §  i  thus as stated for the purposes of the act the term offer is not limited to its commonlaw definition the email message sent to hickey and the materials attached to it contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs hedge funds the returns the funds had earned background information on bulldogs partners news articles about the funds and a description of the plaintiffs investment philosophy and strategy it is clear that these materials were designed to stimulate interest in bulldogs funds thus the communication constituted a solicitation of an offer to buy unregistered securities see i  r mechanical inc v hazelton mfg co  mass app ct    advertisements are usually considered requests for offers see also  williston contracts §  at  th ed   the plaintiffs contend that because hickey would have needed to take additional steps before being permitted to purchase bulldogs securities the email communication cannot constitute an offer because in this context the term offer is not limited to its commonlaw definition see g l c a §  i  it is not required that the plaintiffs communication be such that hickeys assent would have concluded a bargain see note  supra additionally the disclaimers posted on the web site do not defeat liability in order to access certain parts of the web site users are required to acknowledge disclaimers stating that the web site does not constitute a solicitation and the web site cannot be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation in any circumstances where such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful however the plaintiffs cannot escape liability for offering unregistered securities merely by stating to the users of their web site that their conduct does not constitute an offer the presence of a disclaimer asserting that the web site was not an offer or a solicitation is not dispositive the disclaimer is only one factor in determining whether the plaintiffs communication with hickey was an offer or a solicitation cf lemaitre v massachusetts turnpike auth  mass    theos  sons inc v mack trucks inc  mass    here as stated the materials sent to hickey were designed to stimulate interest in purchasing bulldogs securities most importantly the email message sent to hickey and the attachments therein did not contain the disclaimer that was posted on the web site for these reasons the email message sent to hickey was an offer within the meaning of the act  conclusion the secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs and his determination that the plaintiffs violated the act was correct therefore the decision of the superior court affirming the issuance of the cease and desist order and the imposition of the fine was also correct judgment affirmed notes  opportunity partners lp full value partners lp opportunity income plus

contention that the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the secretary of the commonwealth secretary violated due process  from this point forward the plaintiffs did not argue the first amendment claim before the hearing officer instead they asserted that claim without argument in their opposition to the motion for summary decision and stated that they agreed with the secretary that a court should address that claim  the acting director of the securities division stayed the imposition of sanctions until the superior court ruled on a motion for a preliminary injunction in the  usc §  action a judge in the superior court later denied this motion  the judge who decided the plaintiffs g l c a §  action was the same judge who had earlier denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction in the  usc §  action  general laws c a §  authorizes a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a person when a cause of action arises from inter alia the persons transacting any business in this commonwealth  contracting to supply services or things in this commonwealth  causing tortious injury by an act or omission in this commonwealth  or causing tortious injury in this commonwealth by an act or omission outside this commonwealth if he regularly does or solicits business or engages in any other persistent course of conduct or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered in this commonwealth  in other contexts courts have recognized that substituted service provisions authorize personal jurisdiction see hess v pawloski  us    statute considering operation of motor vehicle on public highway to be appointment of state official as agent for receiving process confers personal jurisdiction see also lsi indus inc v hubbell lighting inc  fd   fed cir  renfro v adkins  ark    cherokee v parsons  so d   miss  the plaintiffs point out that the court in mfs series trust iii v grainger  pd   utah  interpreted the substituted service provision of utahs securities act as authorizing service of process but not personal jurisdiction we decline to follow this interpretation because it relies on cases analyzing whether a defendant possessed minimum contacts sufficient to satisfy due process rather than whether personal jurisdiction was statutorily authorized see id  the cases cited by the plaintiffs stating that personal jurisdiction cannot be exercised over corporate officers based on the contacts of their corporation are also inapposite because bulldog is a partnership not a corporation these principles are not applicable to this case even if these cases were applicable they would be unavailing in this case personal jurisdiction was based on the admission each individual plaintiff made in the answer not the contacts of the corporation as stated the secretary was entitled to rely on this admission  the plaintiffs assert that hickeys inquiry to bulldog was made at the request of a competitor with whom bulldog was involved in a legal dispute and was a sham it is irrelevant whether hickey contacted bulldog without the intention of actually purchasing securities  judgment was entered in favor of the secretary in the  usc §  action the plaintiffs appealed that decision and their appeal is now pending in the appeals court  at common law an offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain made in such a way as to justify the other person in understanding that his assent will conclude the agreement i  r mechanical inc v hazelton mfg co  mass app ct    citing restatement second

the commonwealth sjc april   – july   securities uniform securities act secretary of the commonwealth jurisdiction personal nonresident longarm statute due process of law jurisdiction over nonresident contract offer and acceptance civil action commenced in the superior court department on november   the case was heard by judith fabricant j the supreme judicial court on its own initiative transferred the case from the appeals court andrew good philip g cormier with him for the plaintiffs pierce o cray assistant attorney general peter w cassidy with him for the defendant present marshall cj ireland spina cowin cordy  gants jj cowin j a hearing officer in the securities division division of the office of the secretary of the commonwealth secretary found that the plaintiffs violated gl c a the massachusetts uniform securities act act by offering unregistered securities to a massachusetts resident via electronic mail email the plaintiffs sought judicial review of this ruling and a judge in the superior court affirmed the plaintiffs contend that their contacts with the commonwealth were insufficient to permit the secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over them that the act violates their constitutional right to free speech and that the communication did not constitute an offer within the meaning of the act we conclude that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consistent with due process that the constitutional claim is not properly before us and that the secretary determined correctly that the plaintiffs violated the act unlike at common law where the definition of an offer includes only communications to which an offeree’s affirmative response would conclude a bargain the act defines an “offer” more broadly to include the “solicitation of an offer” see gl c a §  i   thus the plaintiffs violated the act by sending to a massachusetts resident materials soliciting an offer to purchase unregistered securities  facts and procedural history we summarize the facts found by the hearing officer supplemented with undisputed facts from the record from approximately june   through january   bulldog investors general partnership bulldog operated an interactive web site that provided information about investment products it offered for sale users could obtain more specific information about bulldog’s “hedge funds” by registering with the site on november   brendan hickey a massachusetts resident registered by providing bulldog with his name address telephone number and email address steven samuels a bulldog employee responded to hickey’s registration with an email message to which documents were attached that contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs’ hedge funds the returns the funds had earned background information on bulldog’s partners news articles about the funds and a description of the plaintiffs’ investment philosophy and strategy samuels also invited hickey to contact him by telephone to discuss bulldog’s funds in greater detail on january   the secretary filed an administrative complaint against the plaintiffs fn alleging that bulldog’s web site and email contact with hickey constituted an offer of securities that were neither registered nor exempt from registration in violation of the act see gl c a §  in their answer the plaintiffs denied violating the act and asserted as affirmative defenses  that the act and the secretary’s regulations violated the plaintiffs’ right to free speech under the first amendment to the united states constitution and art  of the massachusetts declaration of rights and  that in any event the secretary lacked personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs the secretary appointed a hearing officer pursuant to  code mass regs § b  the secretary moved for summary decision arguing that the hearing officer lacked the authority to decide the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims in response the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the superior court pursuant to  usc §  and gl c  § i asserting their constitutional claim regarding free speech fn the plaintiffs sought a stay of the administrative proceeding pending resolution of the first amendment claim in the superior court the hearing officer denied the request she stated that the only issue before her was whether the plaintiffs violated the act and that she was required to make a finding regarding liability before a court could decide whether there had been an abridgement of the plaintiffs’ first amendment right fn the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs had offered unregistered securities for sale in the commonwealth in addition she determined that the plaintiffs did not qualify for various exemptions to the registration requirement finally the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs were subject to personal jurisdiction in massachusetts because their violation of the act constituted a sufficient nexus to permit personal jurisdiction she recommended the issuance of a cease and desist order and a  fine the acting director of the division acting director adopted the hearing officer’s recommended findings of fact and rulings of law and imposed the recommended sanctions fn the plaintiffs sought judicial review of the acting director’s determination in the superior court and moved for judgment on the pleadings see gl c a §  gl c a §  see also standing order  of the rules of the superior court  “a claim for judicial review shall be resolved through a motion for judgment on the pleadings …” in a thoughtful memorandum of decision a judge in the superior court fn denied the motion and affirmed the acting director’s ruling the judge concluded that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consonant with due process in addition she held that after having chosen to use the separate  usc §  action as the vehicle to obtain relief on their first amendment claim the plaintiffs could not raise that claim in the action pursuant to gl c a §  the plaintiffs appealed and we transferred the case from the appeals court on our own motion  standard of review pursuant to gl c a §  “any person aggrieved by a final decision of the secretary in an adjudicatory proceeding may obtain judicial review” see gl c a §  we reverse the secretary’s decision only if it was “a  in violation of constitutional provisions” “b  in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction” of the secretary “c  based upon an error of law” “d  made upon unlawful procedure” “e  unsupported by substantial evidence” “f  unwarranted by facts found by the court … where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact” or “g  arbitrary or capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law” see gl c a §   discussion the plaintiffs contend that the web site and the single email message to hickey were insufficient contacts with the commonwealth to subject them to personal jurisdiction before the secretary they claim that the act does not authorize the secretary to subject nonresidents to administrative enforcement proceedings furthermore they argue that exercising personal jurisdiction in this case violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution because the plaintiffs did not purposefully avail themselves of the benefits of massachusetts law the plaintiffs contend also that “the secretary’s order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful nonmisleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction” in violation of the first amendment and art  they argue in addition that their web site and email message did not constitute an “offer” within the meaning of the act see gl c a §  i   they contend that the communication to hickey was not an offer because he could not have purchased securities merely by responding to the email message in addition they contend that hickey agreed to a disclaimer posted on the web site stating that the information contained therein did not constitute a solicitation the secretary responds that the broad enforcement powers granted him under the act authorized personal jurisdiction in this case he argues also that his exercise of jurisdiction comported with due process because the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in massachusetts furthermore he contends that they could have reasonably anticipated being the subject of an enforcement proceeding by virtue of their violation of the act additionally the secretary contends that the plaintiffs’ first amendment claim is waived and that even if not waived the claim fails because there is no constitutional prohibition on requiring that a seller of securities disclose information about its products through registration before being allowed to offer or advertise them finally the secretary argues that the plaintiffs’ communication with hickey constituted a solicitation that falls within the act’s definition of an offer he notes that the act’s definition of the term “offer” is not limited to its commonlaw definition a personal jurisdiction for a nonresident to be subject to personal jurisdiction in massachusetts there must be a statute authorizing jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction must be “consistent with basic due process requirements mandated by the united states constitution” intech inc v triple “c” marine salvage inc  mass    quoting tatro v manor care inc  mass    we analyze each requirement separately i statutory authorization of personal jurisdiction in court proceedings personal jurisdiction in massachusetts over a nonresident is authorized when one of the provisions of our longarm statute gl c a §  is satisfied see roberts v legendary marine sales  mass    by its terms the longarm statute applies only to courts and cannot authorize an agency to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents see gl c a §  fn however the longarm statute is not the only source for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresidents the text and purposes of the act itself establish that it authorizes the secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents in an administrative proceeding the act prohibits the offering or selling of unregistered securities in the commonwealth unless the securities are exempt from the registration requirement or are federal “covered” securities see gl c a §  the definition of “offer” includes not only offers that originate within the commonwealth but also ones directed into the commonwealth and received at the place to which they are directed see gl c a §  c  the secretary possesses the authority to conduct investigations inside or outside the commonwealth to determine if a violation has occurred see gl c a §  a  he also has broad authority to remedy “a violation of any provision” of the act by “any person” by imposing cease and desist orders or fines see gl c a § a a  these provisions establish that one of the purposes of the act is to protect massachusetts residents from offers and sales of unregistered securities directed at them from other jurisdictions these protections and the secretary’s authority to conduct investigations outside the commonwealth would be meaningless without authorization to subject nonresidents to enforcement proceedings furthermore the act provides that where personal jurisdiction “cannot otherwise be obtained in the commonwealth” any nonresident who has violated the act is deemed to have appointed the secretary as his agent to receive process in any noncriminal proceeding arising out of that conduct see gl c a §  h  this authority to serve process would be ineffective in enforcing the act through administrative proceedings unless accompanied by the power to bring a respondent before a tribunal to adjudicate whether a violation occurred interpreting the statute to authorize service of process without authorizing personal jurisdiction would transform the substituted service provision into a nullity see flemings v contributory retirement appeal bd  mass    “if a sensible construction is available we shall not construe a statute to make a nullity of pertinent provisions or to produce absurd results” fn ii due process ” ‘the constitutional touchstone’ of the determination whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process ‘remains whether the defendant established “minimum contacts” in the forum state’ ” tatro v manor care inc  mass    quoting burger king corp v rudzewicz  us    the due process analysis entails three requirements first minimum contacts must arise from some act by which the defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws” tatro v manor care inc supra quoting asahi metal indus co v superior court  us    second the claim must arise out of or relate to the defendant’s contacts with the forum see tatro v manor care inc supra third “the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant must not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice’ ” tatro v manor care inc supra at  quoting international shoe co v washington  us    by contacting hickey the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business activities in massachusetts and invoked the protection of massachusetts law see tatro v manor care inc supra solicitation of business in massachusetts invokes benefits and protection of massachusetts law be cause the plaintiffs operated a web site accessible in massachusetts and sent a solicitation that is prohibited by massachusetts law to a massachusetts resident it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to anticipate being held responsible in massachusetts see worldwide volkswagen corp v woodson  us    “the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis … is whether the defendant’s conduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there” at the time of their communication with hickey the plaintiffs were on notice that hickey was a resident of massachusetts additionally the act placed the plaintiffs on notice that directing offers of unregistered securities into massachusetts is unlawful see gl c a §§   a  c  by soliciting purchases of their hedge funds the plaintiffs sought to derive commercial benefit from their interaction with hickey therefore it would be unfair “to escape having to account in massachusetts for consequences that arise proximately from such activities” burger king corp v rudzewicz supra at  the plaintiffs suggest that we have ruled in prior cases that contacts more substantial than those existing here were insufficient to sustain personal jurisdiction see roberts v legendary marine sales inc  mass     droukas v divers training academy inc  mass     these cases are inapposite because they considered only whether personal jurisdiction was statutorily authorized by the longarm statute they did not address the due process question the second and third prongs of the due process analysis are also satisfied in this case it is undisputed that the secretary’s enforcement proceedings arose out of the plaintiffs’ contacts with massachusetts finally exercising personal jurisdiction in these circumstances comports with fair play and substantial justice in determining whether fair play and substantial justice are satisfied we weigh the commonwealth’s interest in adjudicating the dispute the burden on the outofstate party of litigating in massachusetts and the commonwealth’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief see burger king corp v rudzewicz supra at  massachusetts has a strong interest in adjudicating violations of massachusetts securities law see tatro v manor care inc supra although there may be some inconvenience to the plaintiffs in litigating in massachusetts such inconvenience does not outweigh the commonwealth’s interest in enforcing its laws in a massachusetts forum the plaintiffs contend that even if the secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over bulldog he could not exert personal jurisdiction over the individual plaintiffs the secretary has the burden of proving facts sufficient to establish that personal jurisdiction is permissible see miller v miller  mass    because the facts in the record are sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over each individual plaintiff that burden has been met here in the administrative complaint the secretary alleged that hickey was sent advertising and offering materials through email in their answer to the administrative complaint each individual plaintiff admitted that he provided information via email to hickey while some of the individual plaintiffs later filed affidavits stating that they were not involved in sending this communication the secretary was entitled to credit the facts admitted in the answer rather than the affidavits see walker v georgetown housing auth  mass   n   fn because each individual plaintiff admitted to facts sufficient to form a basis for personal jurisdiction the secretary’s finding that he possessed personal jurisdiction over all the plaintiffs is supported by substantial evidence fn b first amendment claim the plaintiffs argue that “the secretary’s order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful nonmisleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction” the secretary contends that the plaintiffs’ first amendment claim has been waived and that even if it has not been waived the cease and desist order and the act itself do not violate the constitutional protection of freedom of speech the plaintiffs initially asserted their first amendment defense in their answer to the administrative complaint the hearing officer declined to rule on this issue instead she agreed that the constitutional defense should be decided by a court the hearing officer apparently viewed the constitutional claim as a challenge to the enabling statute and as such beyond the authority of the secretary to adjudicate see gurry v board of public accountancy  mass    in response to the hearing officer’s position the plaintiffs litigated the first amendment issue in a separate action in the superior court in which they asserted violations of  usc §  fn the plaintiffs did not raise the first amendment issue in their complaint for judicial review in the instant case brought pursuant to gl c a §  they did plead the issue and litigate it in the  usc §  action in these unusual circumstances the  usc §  action is the proper forum for resolving the plaintiffs’ first amendment claim c violation of the act the secretary determined properly that the plaintiffs’ email message to hickey violated the act the act defines an offer to include the “solicitation of an offer” see gl c a §  i   thus as stated for the purposes of the act the term “offer” is not limited to its commonlaw definition fn the email message sent to hickey and the materials attached to it contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs’ hedge funds the returns the funds had earned background information on bulldog’s partners news articles about the funds and a description of the plaintiffs’ investment philosophy and strategy it is clear that these materials were designed to stimulate interest in bulldog’s funds thus the communication constituted a solicitation of an offer to buy unregistered securities see i  r mechanical inc v hazelton mfg co  massappct    advertisements are usually considered requests for offers see also  williston contracts §  at  th ed the plaintiffs contend that because hickey would have needed to take additional steps before being permitted to purchase bulldog’s securities the email communication cannot constitute an offer because in this context the term “offer” is not limited to its commonlaw definition see gl c a §  i   it is not required that the plaintiffs’ communication be such that hickey’s assent would have concluded a bargain see note  supra additionally the disclaimers posted on the web site do not defeat liability in order to access certain parts of the web site users are required to acknowledge disclaimers stating that the web site does not constitute a solicitation and the web site cannot be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation in any circumstances where such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful however the plaintiffs cannot escape liability for offering unregistered securities merely by stating to the users of their web site that their conduct does not constitute an offer the presence of a disclaimer asserting that the web site was not an offer or a solicitation is not dispositive the disclaimer is only one factor in determining whether the plaintiffs’ communication with hickey was an offer or a solicitation cf lemaitre v massachusetts turnpike auth  mass    theos  sons inc v mack trucks inc  mass    here as stated the materials sent to hickey were designed to stimulate interest in purchasing bulldog’s securities most importantly the email message sent to hickey and the attachments therein did not contain the disclaimer that was posted on the web site for these reasons the email message sent to hickey was an offer within the meaning of the act  conclusion the secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs and his determination that the plaintiffs violated the act was correct therefore the decision of the superior court affirming the issuance of the cease and desist order and the imposition of the fine was also correct judgment affirmed   fn opportunity partners lp full value partners lp opportunity

das and steven samuels are principals of bulldog plaintiff phillip goldstein is the president of kimball  winthrop inc and a cofounder of bulldog   fn in the  usc §  action the plaintiffs did not assert their contention that the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the secretary of the commonwealth secretary violated due process   fn from this point forward the plaintiffs did not argue the first amendment claim before the hearing officer instead they asserted that claim without argument in their opposition to the motion for summary decision and   stated that they agreed with the secretary that a court should address that claim   fn the acting director of the securities division stayed the imposition of sanctions until the superior court ruled on a motion for a preliminary injunction in the  usc §  action a judge in the superior court later denied this motion   fn the judge who decided the plaintiffs’ gl c a §  action was the same judge who had earlier denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction in the  usc §  action   fn general laws c a §  authorizes a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a person when a cause of action arises from inter alia “the person’s … transacting any business in this commonwealth … contracting to supply services or things in this commonwealth … causing tortious injury by an act or omission in this commonwealth … or causing tortious injury in this commonwealth by an act or omission outside this commonwealth if he regularly does or solicits business or engages in any other persistent course of conduct or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered in this commonwealth”   fn in other contexts courts have recognized that substituted service provisions authorize personal jurisdiction see hess v pawloski  us    statute considering operation of motor vehicle on public highway to be appointment of state official as agent for receiving process confers personal jurisdiction see also lsi indus inc v hubbell lighting inc  fd   fedcir renfro v adkins  ark    cherokee v parsons  sod   miss the plaintiffs point out that the court in mfs series trust iii v grainger  pd   utah  interpreted the substituted service provision of utah’s securities act as authorizing service of process but not personal jurisdiction we decline to follow this interpretation because it relies on cases analyzing whether a defendant possessed minimum contacts sufficient to satisfy due process rather than whether personal jurisdiction was statutorily authorized see id   fn the cases cited by the plaintiffs stating that personal jurisdiction cannot be exercised over corporate officers based on the contacts of their corporation are also inapposite because bulldog is a partnership not a corporation these principles are not applicable to this case even if these cases were applicable they would be unavailing in this case personal   jurisdiction was based on the admission each individual plaintiff made in the answer not the contacts of the corporation as stated the secretary was entitled to rely on this admission   fn the plaintiffs assert that hickey’s inquiry to bulldog was made at the request of a competitor with whom bulldog was involved in a legal dispute and was a “sham” it is irrelevant whether hickey contacted bulldog without the intention of actually purchasing securities   fn judgment was entered in favor of the secretary in the  usc §  action the plaintiffs appealed that decision and their appeal is now pending in the appeals court   fn at common law an offer is “the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain made in such a way as to justify the other person in understanding that his assent will conclude the agreement” i  r
