at exchange rates during the periods of strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar the company incurred  in bank fees during the period ended march   for the three months ended march   the company incurred a net loss of  or  per share liquidity and capital resources as at march   the company had a positive net working capital balance of  compared with  at december    the decrease was primarily due to a use of cash for operating and investing activities during the period operations for the period ended march   were primarily funded through cash balances at december   and the cash received from the issuances of shares of the companys common stock as a result of the exercise of warrants    subject to the launch of the additional pipeline of revenue streams there is no certainty that we will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable operations in the future to enable us to meet our obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going concern the company may require additional funds to further develop our expanded business plan  the company may require additional financing this year to fund our operations and is examining possible sources of funding beyond the existing cash generated from operations  sales of additional equity securities would result in the dilution of the interests of existing stockholders there can be no assurance that financing will be available when required in the event that the necessary additional financing is not obtained the company would reduce its discretionary overhead costs substantially or otherwise curtail operations the company expects the forgoing or a combination thereof to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next  months however these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty net cash used in operating activities during the period ended march   cash used in operations was   this was primarily the result of the net loss incurred offset to some extent by changes in noncash working capital of  net cash provided

risk  the companys risk management objective is to preserve and redeploy the existing treasury as appropriate ultimately to protect shareholder value  risk management strategies as discussed below are designed and implemented to ensure the companys risks and the related exposure are consistent with the business objectives and risk tolerance liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due  the company manages its liquidity by ensuring that there is sufficient capital to meet short and longterm business requirements after taking into account cash requirements from operations and the companys holdings of cash and cash equivalents the company also strives to maintain sufficient financial liquidity at all times in order to participate in investment opportunities as they arise as well as to withstand sudden adverse changes in economic circumstances management forecasts cash flows for its current and subsequent fiscal years to predict future financing requirements  future requirements may be met through a combination of credit and access to capital markets  the companys cash requirements are dependent on the level of operating activity a large portion of which is discretionary  should management decide to increase its operating activity more funds than what is currently in place would be required  it is not possible to predict whether financing efforts will be successful or sufficient in the future   at march   the company had  december    in cash and cash equivalents additionally the company has commitments as detailed in note  to the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements currency risk the companys expenditures are incurred in canadian and us dollars  the results of

appropriate balance of cash in each currency to meet the expenditures  as the companys reporting currency is the us dollar fluctuations in us dollar will affect the results of the company  credit risk   credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterpartys inability to fulfill its payment obligations as at march   and december   the companys credit risk is primarily attributable to cash and cash equivalents cash in trust and customer deposits and accounts receivable at march   and december   the companys cash and cash equivalents cash held in trust and customer deposits was held with

performing and most actively traded microcap stocks of  during the past several months shares of zoompass have gone from almost complete dormancy to trading millions of shares while increasing in share price by as much as  however we believe that the recent move in share price is completely unwarranted and is related to an ongoing stock promotion campaign whereby an advertising budget of nearly  million is being spent on a promotional newsletter touting the company and encouraging investors to purchase the companys common stock as described in a recent press release the company was recently designed as caveat emptor on otcmarketscom and its former name uvic inc appears in a subpoena issued by the securities and exchange commission related to a number of questionable s registration statements issued by prohibited attorney adam s tracy for all of the reasons outlined in this report we believe that shares of zoompass could fall by at least  in the short term company profile zoompass is a financial services company that provides businesses with solutions to help digitize financial transactions the company offers prepaid debit cards member reward systems and an electronic payment platform that enables businesses to provide their customers with a white label mobile wallet according to the companys most recent annual report from the date of incorporation through december   it has generated gross revenues totaling  and has incurred net losses totaling almost  million despite the company boasting an increase in net revenues to just  in the most recent quarter ending march   and announcing an expectation to receive commissions in an undisclosed amount related to a purchase order with an undisclosed third party it currently trades with a market cap of over  based on  shares outstanding as of april   and a share price of  shares of zoompass have increased from about  per share to as high as  per share during the past three months with trading volume increasing significantly although difficult to prove we believe that the main contributor to the stocks recent performance is not the companys recent results but rather an ongoing stock promotion campaign recent company announcements below we have listed all of the companys announcements made during the past several months in our opinion although these press releases occasionally sound upbeat they fail to reference any specific material numbers that could justify the recent increase in market cap to nearly  million zoompass virtual card program enables latin american latam consumers access to us ecommerce markets   zoompass files first quarter results   zoompass issues statement about its common stock otc market listing   zoompass issues statement about promotional activity concerning its common stock   zoompass announces corporate update   zoompass selects uvend group of companies as self serve kiosk and digital partner   zoompass corporate update   zoompass provides operational and corporate update   in our opinion the companys press releases above lack substance for example in the companys operational and corporate update it referenced agreements with synnex canada limited sky devices llc and uvend group but failed to mention specific terms and conditions volatility attributed to stock promotion to date we have discovered advertisements on google and yahoo finance that direct visitors to a website promoting zoompass here in true promotional form the website features a glaring report by editor rick currin that is quick to point out industry statistics and million dollar figures relating to financial technology while lacking substance relating to the companys internal business operations however the most important dollar amount is buried within the legal disclaimer the website is actually a tout sheet whereby a third party sargon finance sa paid almost  million to build investor awareness or in other words to promote shares of the zpas stock to unsuspecting buyers it is our opinion that the recent runup in zoompass is primarily attributed to this nearly  million stock promotion campaign as we have described in past reports shares of heavily promoted stocks like zoompass are temporarily inflated during the promotional campaign and almost always crash in the short term we have found the smoking gun evidence linking zoompass to another heavily promoted stock pura naturals inc otcqbpnat and believe that the two stocks will behave similarly specifically we believe that shares of zpas will decline by  from prevailing market prices similar to the way pura naturals traded when its stock promotion campaign topped out zoompass  pura naturals nearly identical promotional campaigns zoompass and pura naturals have been the subject to promotional campaigns that are so similar in nature that we believe it is not unreasonable to anticipate the two stocks behaving similarly at least in the short term for zoompass this could mean a sharp decline of more than  in the short term below we have outlined three of the most brazen similarities between the two stock promotion campaigns  creative direct marketing group creative direct marketing group is an advertising and digital marketing agency located in southern california that appears to be at least partially responsible for the investor awareness ad campaigns targeting both zoompass holdings inc and pura naturals inc in addition to the similar website layouts and domain names used for both the zoompass stock promotion zoompassinvestorcom and pura naturals stock promotion purainvestorcom you can find direct evidence connecting creative direct marketing group to both stock promotion advertisements update   pm

is referenced in the legal disclaimer of the pnat promotional website coincidentally both zoompass holdings and pura naturals were subject to stock promotion campaigns with budgets just shy of  million managed at least in part by creative direct marketing group  the denial of involvement on may   zoompass issued a press release regarding a promotional newsletter touting the companys stock compare zoompasss press release with the one issued by pura naturals on january   zoompass issues statement about promotional activity concerning its common stock pura naturals inc issues statement about promotional activity concerning its common stock the two companyissued press releases above have many sections that are almost identical in context with some areas copied verbatim the two most likely explanations for these similar press releases is either plagiarism or a related party being responsible for the authoring of both companies press releases based on all of our other findings we believe the likelihood of the latter is very high  the chart patterns below is a historical stock chart for pura naturals inc for the relevant time period when its stock was subjected to a promotion campaign compare the chart above with the current stock chart for zoompass and you will notice that to date the charts are nearly identical both stocks were dormant for months and traded at approximately  per share then all of a sudden each stocks volume spiked right around the time when promotional newsletter campaigns began surfacing on the internet after each stock climbed for about  trading days share prices hit  and  respectively next both stocks plummeted by more than  before bouncing pura naturals shares bounced all the way back to  but failed to break out to new alltime highs in the  trading days that followed the stock fell by as much as  although in the long term each companys stock will be more reflective of the successes or failures of each operating business in the short term it is our opinion that the stock chart for zoompass holdings is driven more by the current promotional campaign than by internal business operations and company news releases since the promotional campaign itself along with the stock chart closely resembles the promotional campaign and stock chart for pura naturals we believe that the two will continue to act similar in the short term for zoompass this could mean an imminent collapse of  in the short term zoompass  pura naturals more connections between the two in addition to the resemblances between the stock promotion campaigns subjected to zoompass and pura naturals there are also internal examples that demonstrate how the companies themselves may be connected robert rob lee robert rob lee has maintained the position of chief executive officer and director of zoompass holdings inc since august  in addition to previously serving as the president and ceo of a company that eventually went into receivership lee has focused on the financing and restructuring of various private entities one career endeavor apparently missing from robert lees bio involves an obscure reference to lee within a share exchange agreement related to pura naturals inc found in a form k filed on july   although we have been unable to reach a representative of zoompass to clarify robert lees full involvement with pura naturals inc a reuters company profile page lists robert lee as being appointed as a director to pura naturals in april  in fact we believe there is a possibility that robert lee may in fact also be the chief executive officer of pura natural inc under the name robert doherty obscure executive officer listed in zoompasss annual report smoking gun evidence connecting zoompass to pura naturals can be seen on page  of zpass most recent annual report filed on april   in the list of executive officers section robert doherty is listed as director and chief executive officer of zoompass holdings robert doherty also happens to be listed as the chief executive officer for pura naturals inc in the companys most recent annual report either there was a highly unusual typo in the zoompass annual report that mistakenly listed pura naturals ceo as its own or robert lee and robert doherty may be the same individual according to a bloomberg biography the chief executive officer for zoompass holdings inc is robert doherty lee if robert doherty lee is serving dual roles as both the chief executive officer of zoompass holdings inc and pura naturals inc we believe that investors should remain highly suspicious of the failure to disclose this relevant information in the sec filings conclusion our trading thesis is based on the belief that the recent surge in share price for zoompass holdings inc is more heavily attributed to an ongoing stock promotion campaign rather than the companys recent operating results as we have explained although the company has recently announced press releases that could be perceived positively they lack substance and are very unlikely to be responsible for the recent meteoric rise in the zoompass stock if the stocks shortterm price fluctuation is driven primarily by the stock promotion and if zoompass and pura naturals are related to the extent that we have outlined in this report we believe that zoompass shares will trade comparatively to how pura naturals traded when its own stock was subject to a very similar promotion specifically this would mean that zoompass shares could decline by  in as little as  trading days disclosure iwe have no

for shareholders of record on september     item a risk factors global economic conditions the unprecedented events in global financial markets in the past several years have had a profound impact on the global economy many industries have been impacted by these market conditions market events and conditions including volatility in the international credit markets and other financial systems and the deterioration of global economic conditions could impede the companys access to capital or increase the cost of capital and may adversely affect the companys operations the company is also exposed to liquidity risks in meeting its operating and capital expenditure requirements in instances where the companys cash position is unable to be maintained or appropriate financing is unavailable these factors may impact the companys ability to obtain capital on terms favourable to it or at all increased market volatility may impact the companys operations which could adversely affect the trading price of the common shares operating and capital requirements the company competes for financing and personnel with other financial technology companies there can be no assurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available when needed or that if available the terms of such financing will be favourable to the company the company may need to make significant expenditures in connection with the development of its platform or other lines of business  there is no assurance that any such funds will be available for operations and the ability of the company to raise such capital will depend in part upon conditions in the capital markets at the time and its historical business performance if additional capital is raised by the issuance of shares from the treasury of the company shareholders may suffer dilution future borrowings by the company or its subsidiaries may increase the level of financial and interest rate risk to the company as the company will be required to service future indebtedness further failure to obtain additional financing on a timely basis could cause the company to reduce suspend or terminate its proposed operations dependence on highly skilled personnel the companys prospects depend in part on the services of key executives and other highly skilled and experienced personnel focused on managing the companys interests in addition to the identification of new opportunities for growth and funding the loss of these persons or the companys inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees required for the companys activities may have a material adverse effect on its business or future operations the company does not currently maintain key person life insurance on any of its key employees        negative operating cash flow the company has negative operating cash flow and may continue to have negative operating cash flow in future periods to the extent that the company has negative operating cash flow the company will need to continue to deploy a portion of its cash reserves to fund such negative operating cash flow limited operating history of the companys new direction no assurance of profitability anticipated losses the company has a limited operating history and accordingly has a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business our business must be considered in light of the risks expenses and problems frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets which involve technology the in development operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise accordingly the likelihood of our success must be considered in the light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the starting and expansion of a business and the relatively competitive environment in which we will operate unanticipated delays expenses and other problems such as setbacks in launch and development product sourcing manufacturing and market acceptance are frequently encountered in establishing a new business such as the companys there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition   because of the companys limited operating history the company has limited historical financial data on which to base planned operating expenses accordingly our expense levels which are to a large extent variable will be based in part on our expectations of future revenues as a result of the variable nature of many of our expenses we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected delays in the development and marketing of our products or any subsequent revenue shortfall any such delays or shortfalls will have an immediate adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition   the company has not achieved profitability to date to the extent that net revenue does not grow at anticipated rates or that increases in its operating expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by commensurate increases in net revenue or that the company is unable to adjust operating expense levels accordingly the companys business results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected there can be no assurance that the companys operating losses will not increase in the future or that the company will ever achieve or sustain profitability regulatory risk although the company follows certain laws and regulations and receives the requisite approvals to operate in the lines of business it currently or intends to operate in there is no guarantee that these laws regulations and approvals will not be challenged or impugned further changing regulatory regimes may subject the company to new laws and regulations  changes in the regulatory environment the company operates in can have a material adverse affect on operations demand for our products and services may not develop as expected our projected revenues and profits will be affected future profits are influenced by many factors including economics and will be predicated on a stable andor growing market and the purchase and consumption of our products and services  the company believes and our growth expectations assume that the markets for our suite of products and services will continue to grow that the company will increase its  penetration of these markets and that our anticipated revenue from selling into this market will continue to increase if the companys expectations as to the size of these markets and its ability to sell our products and services in this market are not correct our revenue may not materialize and our business will be harmed operating results may fluctuate and may fall below expectations in any fiscal quarter our operating results are difficult to predict and are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control as a result comparing our operating results on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results or future predictions prepared by the company as an indication of our future performance if our revenue or operating results fall in any period the value of our common stock would likely decline        factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate include     ● our ability to arrange potential financing or generate operating cash flows   ● our ability to acquire products to resell to our customers   ● changes in federal state and local government   ● availability and costs of labor and equipment   ● the addition of new customers or the loss of existing customers   ● our ability to control costs including operating expenses   ● changes in the mix of our products and services   ● the length of our sales cycle   ● the productivity and growth of our sales force   ● the timing of opening of new offices or making other significant investments in the growth of our business as the revenue we hope to generate from those expenses often lags several quarters behind those expenses   ● changes in pricing by us or our competitors   ● costs related to the acquisition and integration of companies or assets   ● general economic trends including changes in geopolitical events such as war or incidents of terrorism and   ● future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policies the company operates in a highly competitive industry and competitors may compete more effectively many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater resources than us and could focus their substantial financial resources to develop a competing business model develop products or services that are more attractive to potential customers than what we offer or convince our potential customers that they should require financing arrangements that would be impractical for smaller companies to offer our competitors may also offer products and services at prices below cost andor devote significant sales forces to competing with us or attempt to recruit our key personnel by increasing compensation any of which could improve their competitive positions any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers cause us to lower our prices in order to compete and reduce our market share and revenue any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results we can provide no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete against our current competitors or additional companies that may enter our markets    international operations could expose business to additional risks  the company expects to generate a portion of sales outside of canada in the future operating internationally is one of our growth strategies and we expect our revenue and operations outside of north america will expand in the future these operations will be subject to a variety of risks that we do not face currently     · establishing and managing highly experienced foreign suppliers distributors and relationships and overseeing and ensuring the performance of foreign subcontractors   · increased travel infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations   · additional withholding taxes or other taxes on our foreign income and tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment   · imposition of or unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements many of which differ from those which the company currently operates in   · increased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk   · longer payment cycles for sales in some foreign countries and potential difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable   · difficulties in repatriating overseas earnings   · general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate and   · political unrest war incidents of terrorism or responses to such events      our overall success in international markets will depend in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in managing these risks in each country where we do business our failure to manage these risks successfully could harm our international operations reduce our international sales and increase our costs thus adversely affecting our business financial condition and operating results the company relies on outside consultants service providers and suppliers  we will rely on the experience of consultants service providers and suppliers  in the event that one or more of these consultants or terminates its relationship with the company or becomes unavailable suitable replacements will need to be obtained and there is no assurance that such consultants service providers and suppliers  could be obtained under conditions favorable to us   we rely on strategic relationships to promote our products the company relies on strategic partnerships with outside companies and individuals to promote and supply certain of our products and services thus making the future success of our business particularly contingent on the efforts of other parties an important part of our strategy is to promote acceptance of our products through with certain service providers who we feel could assist us with our promotion strategies our dependence raises potential risks with respect to the future success of our business our success is dependent on the successful completion and commercial deployment of our products and services and on the future commitment of our distributors to our products and technology   reliance on our suppliers the company relies vendors and suppliers to provide power as well as high quality products and services on a consistent basis  the future success of the company is contingent on the efforts and performance of these suppliers the company may have difficulty in locating or using alternative resources should supply problems arise with the current suppliers an interruption or reduction in the source of supply of or an unanticipated increase in vendor prices could materially affect our operating results and damage customer relationships as well as our business  future growth could strain resources and if the company is unable to manage growth it may not be able to successfully implement our business plan   the company hopes to experience rapid growth in operations which will place a significant strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively this will require that we hire and train additional personnel to manage our expanding operations in addition we must continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures if we fail to successfully manage our growth we may be unable to execute upon our business plan failure to protect intellectual property our planned business could be adversely affected  despite efforts to protect and ensure the company has proprietary rights parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products obtain claim and use information that we regard as proprietary unauthorized use of our proprietary technology could harm our business litigation to protect our intellectual property rights can be costly and timeconsuming to prosecute and there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action unforeseen liabilities from past acquisitions there may be liabilities and claims that the company has failed to discover or has underestimated in connection with previous acquisitions in addition there may be expenditure requirements that the company has failed to discover or underestimated in connection with these acquisitions which amounts may be material any such liabilities or expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition or future prospects   conflicts of interest certain of the directors and officers of the corporation also serve as directors andor officers of other companies there exists the possibility for such directors and officers to be in a position of conflict any decision made by any of such directors and officers will be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to deal fairly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and its shareholders in addition each director is required to declare and refrain from voting on any matter in which such director may have a conflict of interest          if we issue additional shares in the future it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock with a par value of  per share our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more companies or products and to fund our overhead and general operating requirements the issuance of any such shares will reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock if we issue any such additional shares such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders further such issuance may result in a change of control of our company   trading of our stock is restricted by the securities exchange commissions penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our common stock   the securities and exchange commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price as defined less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the securities and exchange commission which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to trade our securities we believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock finra sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock  in addition to the penny stock rules described above the financial industry regulatory authority finra has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer a brokerdealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our stock   the price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors that are unrelated to our operations although our common stock is currently listed for quotation on the otc markets and a market is established and trading has begun trading through the otcqb is frequently thin and highly volatile there is no assurance that a sufficient market will continue in our stock in which case it could be difficult for stockholders to sell their stock the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth quarterly operating results of our competitors trading volume in our common stock changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us in addition the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock          we do not intend to pay dividends on any investment in the shares of stock of our company

     revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time persuasive evidence of an agreement exists price is fixed and determinable the delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured in addition the company applies the following specific revenue recognition policies a the companys revenues are primarily generated from financial service fees charged to cardholders and merchants accepting the cards for payment revenue for prepaid financial services is generated from multiple sources including transaction fees cardholder fees load fees and interchange fees these fees are recognized on the transaction date  funds received from customers are held in trust and the corresponding amount of funds available for use are recorded as a liability b fees charged for card program website and card design are recognized when services are performed or when the product is transferred to the customer c other income represents gains realized on derecognition of clients funds payable financial instruments asc topic  defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements included in the asc topic  framework is a three level valuation inputs hierarchy with level  being inputs and transactions that can be effectively fully observed by market participants spanning to level  where estimates are unobservable by market participants outside of the company and must be estimated using assumptions developed by the company the company discloses the lowest level input significant to each category of asset or liability valued within the scope of asc topic  and the valuation method as exchange income or use the company uses inputs which are as observable as possible and the methods most applicable to the specific situation of each company or valued item the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents cash in trust and customer deposits accounts receivables accounts payable and client funds approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization per asc topic  framework these are considered level  inputs where inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities the companys policy is to recognize transfers into and out of level  as of the date of the event or change in the circumstances that caused the transfer there were no such transfers during the year basic and diluted loss per share basic and diluted loss per share has been determined by dividing the net loss available to shareholders for the applicable period by the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding respectively the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is calculated as if all dilutive options had been exercised or vested at the later of the beginning of the reporting period or date of grant using the treasury stock method loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the period common share equivalents options and warrants are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share when their effect is antidilutive segment reporting asc  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in the companys consolidated financial statements operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance the company does not have any reportable segments and significantly all assets are located in and all revenues are currently earned in canada        cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits held with banks and highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of ninety days or less at acquisition date  for purposes of reporting cash flows the company considers all cash accounts that are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties to be cash and cash equivalents cash in trust and customer deposits are amounts held by the company at various financial institutions for settlement of clients funds payable  client funds are amounts owing on behalf of clients for prepaid debit cards inventories  inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market cost is recorded at standard cost which approximates actual cost on the firstin firstout basis property and equipment   property and equipment is stated at historic cost the company has the following subcategories of property and equipment with useful lives and depreciation methods as follows ● computer equipment and furniture  –  declining balance per year the cost of assets sold retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred intangibles   the company has applied the provisions of asc topic  – intangibles – goodwill and other in accounting for its intangible assets intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized on a straightline method on the basis over the useful life of the respective intangibles impairment of nonfinancial assets the company follows the asc topic  which requires that longlived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amounts may not be recoverable or in the case of intangible assets having an indefinite useful life assessed for impairment annually in performing the review for recoverability if future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets are less than their carrying values an impairment loss represented by the difference between its fair value and carrying value is recognized when properties are classified as held for sale they are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell     income taxes   deferred taxation is recognised using the asset and liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes however the deferred taxation is not recognised if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss deferred taxation is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred taxation asset is realised or the deferred taxation liability is settled deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised   sharebased payment expense the company follows the fair value method of accounting for stock awards granted to employees directors officers and consultants sharebased awards to employees are measured at the fair value of the related sharebased awards sharebased payments to others are valued based on the related services rendered or goods received or if this cannot be reliably measured on the fair value of the instruments issued issuances of shares are valued using the fair value of the shares at the time of grant issuances of warrants and other sharebased awards are valued using the blackscholes model with assumptions based on historical experience and future expectations the company recognizes such awards over the vesting period if any based on the number of awards expected to vest over that period on a straightline basis            business combinations   a business combination is a transaction or other event in which control over one or more businesses is obtained a business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends lower costs or other economic benefits a business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs that provide a return to the company and its shareholders a business need not include all of the inputs and processes that were used by the acquiree to produce outputs if the business can be integrated with the inputs and processes of the company to continue to produce outputs the company considers several factors to determine whether the set of activities and assets is a business business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method whereby acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition with the excess of the purchase consideration over such fair value being recorded as goodwill and allocated to cash generating units cgus if the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase consideration the difference is recognized immediately as a gain in the consolidated statement of operations acquisition related costs are expensed during the period in which they are incurred except for the cost of debt or equity instruments issued in relation to the acquisition which is included in the carrying amount of the related instrument certain fair values may be estimated at the acquisition date pending confirmation or completion of the valuation process where provisional values are used in accounting for a business combination they are adjusted retrospectively in subsequent periods however the measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date if the assets acquired are not a business the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition   use of estimates   the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates the areas where management has made significant judgments include but are not limited to accounting for acquisitions  the accounting for acquisitions requires judgement to determine if an acquisition meets the definition of a business combination under asc   further management is required to use judgement to determine the fair value of the consideration provided and the net assets and liabilities acquired   impairment longlived assets  the company reviews and evaluates its longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows or upon an estimate of fair value that may be received in an exchange transaction as of december   the company performed a qualitative analysis of events or circumstances and determined that none existed that would require a quantitative analysis estimates and assumptions used to assess recoverability of the companys longlived assets are subject to risk uncertainty changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of its longlived assets in estimating future cash flows assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups   deferred taxes the company recognizes the deferred tax benefit related to deferred income tax assets to the extent recovery is probable  assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets requires management to make significant estimates of future taxable profit and the income tax rate at which the future tax assets will be realized  to the extent that future cash flows taxable profit and income tax rates differ significantly from estimates the ability of the company to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted  in addition future changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the company to obtain tax deductions in future periods from deferred income tax assets derivative financial instruments  the company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow market or foreign currency risks the company reviews the terms of equity instruments and other financing arrangements if any to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments including embedded conversion options that are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative financial instrument also in connection with the issuance of financing instruments the company may issue freestanding options or warrants to employees and nonemployees in connection with consulting or other services these options or warrants may depending on their terms be accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities rather than as equity derivative financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value for derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income to the extent that the initial fair values of the freestanding andor bifurcated derivative instrument liabilities exceed the total proceeds received an immediate charge to income is recognized in order to initially record the derivative instrument liabilities at their fair value the classification of derivative instruments including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity is reassessed at the end of each reporting period if reclassification is required the fair value of the derivative instrument as of the determination date is reclassified any previous charges or credits to income for changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are not reversed derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or noncurrent based on whether or not netcash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic

concern zoompas holdings inc formerly known as uvic inc zoompass holdings or the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on august    effective august   the company entered into an agreement for the exchange of stock the agreement with zoompass inc an ontario canada corporation zoompass   pursuant to the agreement the company agreed to issue  shares of its restricted common stock to zoompass shareholders zoompass shareholders in exchange for all the shares of zoompass inc owned by the zoompass incs shareholders  at the closing date rob lee a significant shareholder of the company agreed to cancel  shares of the companys common stock which shares constituted the control shares of the company  other than this one significant shareholder shareholders of the company held  shares as a result of the agreement zoompass is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  the company has amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to zoompass holdings inc and the appropriate forms were filed with finra and the sec to change its name address and symbol and complete a  forward split which was consented to by the majority of shareholders on september   and approved in february  for shareholders of record on september     all share figures have been retroactively stated to reflect the stock split approved by shareholders unless otherwise indicated  additionally the companys shareholders consented to an increase of the shares authorized to  and a revision of the par value to  as the former zoompass shareholders ended up owning the majority of the company the transaction does not constitute a business combination and was deemed to be a recapitalization of the company with zoompass being the accounting acquirer accordingly the accounting and disclosure information is that of zoompass going forward zoompass inc was incorporated under the laws of ontario on june    on june   pursuant to an agreement with a shareholder of zoompass certain net assets were acquired by zoompass in exchange for shares of zoompass note   the net assets primarily consisted of a virtual payment platform certain customer contracts cash held in trust and customer deposits as well as the associated client funds there is no certainty that the company will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable operations in the future to enable it to meet its obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going concern the company will require additional financing this year to fund its operations and it is currently working on securing this funding through corporate collaborations public or private equity offerings or debt financings sales of additional equity securities by the company would result in the dilution of the interests of existing shareholders there can be no assurance that financing will be available when required the company expects the forgoing or a combination thereof to meet the companys anticipated cash requirements for the next  months however these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern  these consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the company will continue as a going concern which presumes that it will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business as they come due these consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported expenses and consolidated statement of balance sheet classifications that would be necessary if the company were unable to realize its assets and settle its liabilities as a going concern in the normal course of operations such adjustments could be material note  — significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies basis of presentation  the

assessing whether the group can control the operating policies through the groups ability to appoint the majority of directors to the board the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the

balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between the entities are eliminated translation of foreign currencies the reporting currency of the company is the us dollar the company has determined that the functional currency of its subsidiaries is the canadian dollar  references to which are denoted c transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of the exchange prevailing on dates of transactions at each balance sheet reporting date monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at each reporting date nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the historical date of the transaction  the impact from the translation of foreign currency denominated items are reflected in the statement of operations translation of zoompass assets and liabilities is done using the exchange rates at each balance sheet date revenue and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the reporting period or at the date of the transaction shareholders equity is translated at historical

changes in shareholders equity revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time persuasive evidence of an agreement exists price is fixed and determinable the delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured in addition the company applies the following specific revenue recognition policies a the companys revenues are primarily generated from financial service fees charged to cardholders and merchants accepting the cards for payment revenue for prepaid financial services is generated from multiple sources including transaction fees cardholder fees load fees and interchange fees these fees are recognized on the transaction date  funds received from customers are held in trust and the corresponding amount of funds available for use are recorded as a liability     b fees charged for card program website and card design are recognized when services are performed or when the product is transferred to the customer     c other income represents gains realized on derecognition of clients funds payable financial instruments asc topic  defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements included in the asc topic  framework is a three level valuation inputs hierarchy with level  being inputs and transactions that can be effectively fully observed by market participants spanning to level  where estimates are unobservable by market participants outside of the company and must be estimated using assumptions developed by the company the company discloses the lowest level input significant to each category of asset or liability valued within the scope of asc topic  and the valuation method as exchange income or use the company uses inputs which are as observable as possible and the methods most applicable to the specific situation of each company or valued item       f     zoompass holdings inc formerly uvic inc notes to the consolidated financial statements expressed in us dollars the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents cash in trust and customer deposits accounts receivables net of any allowances for doubtful accounts accounts payable and accrued liabilities and client funds approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization the allowance for doubtful accounts is reflected in office and sundry expenses on the statement of operations and comprehensive loss  per asc topic  framework these are considered level  inputs where inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities the companys policy is to recognize transfers into and out of level  as of the date of the event or change in the circumstances that caused the transfer there were no such transfers during the year basic and diluted loss per share basic and diluted loss per share has been determined by dividing the net loss available to shareholders for the applicable period by the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding respectively the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is calculated as if all dilutive options had been exercised or vested at the later of the beginning of the reporting period or date of grant using the treasury stock method loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the period common share equivalents options and warrants are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share when their effect is antidilutive   segment reporting asc  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in the companys consolidated financial statements operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance the company does not have any reportable segments and significantly all of the assets are located in and all revenues are currently earned in canada cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits held with banks and highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of ninety days or less at acquisition date  for purposes of reporting cash flows the company considers all cash accounts that are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties to be cash and cash equivalents cash in trust and customer deposits are amounts held by the company at various financial institutions for settlement of clients funds payable  client funds are amounts owing on behalf of clients for prepaid debit cards inventories  inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market cost is recorded at standard cost which approximates actual cost on the firstin firstout basis property and equipment   property and equipment is stated at historic cost the company has the following subcategories of property and equipment with useful lives and depreciation methods as follows ● computer equipment and furniture  –  declining balance per year the cost of assets sold retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred intangibles   the company has applied the provisions of asc topic  – intangibles – goodwill and other in accounting for its intangible assets intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized on a straightline method on the basis over the useful life of the respective intangibles impairment of nonfinancial assets the company follows the asc topic  which requires that longlived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amounts may not be recoverable or in the case of intangible assets having an indefinite useful life assessed for impairment annually in performing the review for recoverability if future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets are less than their carrying values an impairment loss represented by the difference between its fair value and carrying value is recognized when properties are classified as held for sale they are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell       f     zoompass holdings inc formerly uvic inc notes to the consolidated financial statements expressed in us dollars     income taxes   deferred taxation is recognised using the asset and liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes however the deferred taxation is not recognised if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss deferred taxation is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred taxation asset is realised or the deferred taxation liability is settled deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised sharebased payment expense the company follows the fair value method of accounting for stock awards granted to employees directors officers and consultants sharebased awards to employees are measured at the fair value of the related sharebased awards sharebased payments to others are valued based on the related services rendered or goods received or if this cannot be reliably measured on the fair value of the instruments issued issuances of shares are valued using the fair value of the shares at the time of grant issuances of warrants and other sharebased awards are valued using the blackscholes model with assumptions based on historical experience and future expectations all issuances of sharebased payments have been fullyvested otherwise the company recognizes such awards over the vesting period based on expectations of the number of awards expected to vest over that period on a straightline basis business combinations a business combination is a transaction or other event in which control over one or more businesses is obtained a business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends lower costs or other economic benefits a business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs that provide a return to the company and its shareholders a business need not include all of the inputs and processes that were used by the acquiree to produce outputs if the business can be integrated with the inputs and processes of the company to continue to produce outputs the company considers several factors to determine whether the set of activities and assets is a business business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method whereby acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition with the excess of the purchase consideration over such fair value being recorded as goodwill and allocated to cash generating units cgus if the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase consideration the difference is recognized immediately as a gain in the consolidated statement of operations acquisition related costs are expensed during the period in which they are incurred except for the cost of debt or equity instruments issued in relation to the acquisition which is included in the carrying amount of the related instrument certain fair values may be estimated at the acquisition date pending confirmation or completion of the valuation process where provisional values are used in accounting for a business combination they are adjusted retrospectively in subsequent periods however the measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date if the assets acquired are not a business the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition   use of estimates   the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates the areas where management has made significant judgments include but are not limited to accounting for acquisitions the accounting for acquisitions requires judgement to determine if an acquisition meets the definition of a business combination under asc   further management is required to use judgement to determine the fair value of the consideration provided and the net assets and liabilities acquired   impairment longlived assets the company reviews and evaluates its longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows or upon an estimate of fair value that may be received in an exchange transaction as of december   the company performed a qualitative analysis of events or circumstances and determined that none existed that would require a quantitative analysis estimates and assumptions used to assess recoverability of the companys longlived assets are subject to risk uncertainty changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of its longlived assets in estimating future cash flows assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups   deferred taxes the company recognizes the deferred tax benefit related to deferred income tax assets to the extent recovery is probable  assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets requires management to make significant estimates of future taxable profit and the income tax rate at which the future tax assets will be realized  to the extent that future cash flows taxable profit and income tax rates differ significantly from estimates the ability of the company to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted  in addition future changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the company to obtain tax deductions in future periods from deferred income tax assets derivative financial instruments  the company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow market or foreign currency risks the company reviews the terms of equity instruments and other financing arrangements if any to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments including embedded conversion options that are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative financial instrument also in connection with the issuance of financing instruments the company may issue freestanding options or warrants to employees and nonemployees in connection with consulting or other services these options or warrants may depending on their terms be accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities rather than as equity     f     zoompass holdings inc formerly uvic inc notes to the consolidated financial statements expressed in us dollars derivative financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value for derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income to the extent that the initial fair values of the freestanding andor bifurcated derivative instrument liabilities exceed the total proceeds received an immediate charge to income is recognized in order to initially record the derivative instrument liabilities at their fair value the classification of derivative instruments including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity is reassessed at the end of each reporting period if reclassification is required the fair value of the derivative instrument as of the determination date is reclassified any previous charges or credits to income for changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are not reversed derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or noncurrent based on whether or not netcash settlement of
