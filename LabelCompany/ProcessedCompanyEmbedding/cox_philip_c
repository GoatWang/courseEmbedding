called that in and was told to come in and get a new box or a technician will come out my husband although he was tired went and picked up the new box the problem did not resolve as a matter of fact we werent receiving any signal fron those channels at all a techician was sent out who brought another box yet the problem remained i called and spoke to one of the technicians on  he said that he noticed some breking up on his end so hell pass it on to the day supervisor to call me by this time i was getting very tired and frustrated with this issue i did not receive any call from any supervisor on  i called manager michael who appologised and said that he will send someone out he also said that he would credit our account fron  to  a technician came out and fixed the problem on  that night i noticed that channel  the weather channel was freezingpuzzling i called and left a message with micahel manager on with no response on  i called and was told that this problem has been going on way too long so they would send a field supervisor to diagnose and fix the problem on  the technician came out he said since the other televisions without a box are being affected the problem is not withyou guys its with the station itself he said he would report it and they would deal directly with the station on  todd brinklow  called and left a message wondering if the issue was
