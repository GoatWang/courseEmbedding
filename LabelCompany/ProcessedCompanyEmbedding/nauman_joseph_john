incorporated by the commonwealth of massachusetts on january   for the purpose of encouraging athletic exercises yachting and especially by maintaining a club house the first clubhouse was on fish island but in  the club moved to larger quarters on popes island the second house was a two and a half story victorian structure built over the water on pilings then as now the club represented diverse boating interests charter members were from new bedford and fairhaven and were either enthusiastic oarsmen who had participated in rowing races on the acushnet river and elsewhere or yachtsmen pleasure sailors who had enjoyed the lively competition and ideal sailing conditions in new bedford harbor and buzzards bay both cruising and racing were important to early new bedford yachtsmen the club grew quickly by  membership had increased to  and the fleet to  boats research has not yet revealed what athletic exercises engaged the  yachtless members possibly some owned shells or wherries the yearbook offers no clue a typical season in the s and s opened with a memorial day full dress review and regatta the club then scheduled one or two more regattas and almost weekly cruises through the season in  the bylaws were amended to permit a junior membership category for boys under  by the end of the th century the new bedford yacht club members were beginning to keep their boats in nonindustrial padanaram harbor in  the yacht club built a second station in padanaram the building stood substantially as it is today except the porches were not enclosed and there was no junior room two tennis courts occupied the parking lot by the elm street entrance and a croquet court was planned but never materialized just north of the yacht club gates stood a bandstand where concerts were given on sunday nights during the summer season in the first decade of the th century the club continued to schedule frequent cruises and to participate in regattas with other clubs but the number of power launches in the yacht club increased dramatically power boat races became the most important events in the new bedford yacht club memorial day regatta of six classes racing from the new bedford station on may   three were power classes two were sail and one a single scull class the social pace sped up too with hops or smokers occurring weekly during the season a band concert and fireworks on the th of july and tennis tournaments scheduled at the padanaram station in  a power squadron was formed within the new bedford yacht club in that year power and sailboats were in equal ratio but by  the ratio had tipped in favor of sail again and the new bedford power squadron has gone out of existence thereafter while the club has continued to include a large powerboat fleet sail has predominated during world war i the club curtailed its activities and many of the boat owners enrolled in the coast guard to patrol local waters in the aftermath of the war the clubs focus seems to have shifted from cruising activities to racing the first one design class toppan   cabin racing dories appeared in  by the end of the decade alden os hereshoff s herreshoff s knockabouts herreshoff and alden s wee scotts buzzards bay submarines and beetle cats were included in the fleet the new bedford yacht club race week was inaugurated in  it was an elaborate affair with races for twelve different types of classes for boats ranging from herreshoff s to alden and herreshoff s and powerboats one day of the week was devoted to water sports  swimming diving tub and canoe races and canoe tilting chowders clambakes and three hops in the course of the sixday celebration sustained the racers when the bermuda race was renewed in  by yachting magazine six of the participating yachts were from the new bedford yacht club in  russell grinnell in rugosa ii won class a of the bermuda race saturday afternoon races were organized at the club by rear commodore gardiner akin no series racing had existed before mr akin organized the six classes in  the program was expanded to wednesday afternoons in  the club opened the depression decade by extensively redecorating both stations in time for the  club commissioning race week was reduced to three days because coming in the middle of a season peppered with regattas a week is too long a time to demand of an average skipper one design racing continued to develop particularly the beetle class and the whalers race originally the whalers  mile race to be open to any boat of a wholesome cruising type was inaugurated as an annual event in  the fleet continued to grow in  and  but with the advent of world war ii the club activities were cut back during the war members of the yacht club again served as auxiliary coast guard members patrolling the familiar local coastline by  the club had returned to a full schedule of yachting activities the beetle cat fleet numbered fortytwo down from s high of fiftythree but still large enough to be divided into two divisions in each of the wednesday and saturday series there were three intraclub regattas for all classes two commodores cup races for beetle cats a weekend cruise an annual regatta for seven classes and the russ smith memorial race in addition to the casey cup and whalers race the popes island station was sold in  concentrating the clubs activities at the padanaram station in  the junior sailing group was organized with the guidance and generous support of walter n rothschild after mr rothschilds death in  his friends and family contributed funds to build the rothschild memorial room an addition to the clubhouse for the use of junior members by the early  facilities for both cars and boats became overcrowded the parking problem was solved by a complicated arrangement of land purchase and swapping that resulted in club ownership of the south lot during this process the south dock was constructed providing additional boat slips the club continued to develop a varied boating program to accommodate the wide range of nautical interests represented in the club frostbite racing a predicted log race and a fishing derby were added to the club program with intermittent success and five new perpetual trophies were added for cruising class races beginning in the s the club responded to the trend toward onedesign invitational events the north american mens sailing championships  the mallory cup with dedicated and skilled committees both ashore and afloat the series ran in  without a flaw although or perhaps because sailing racing competitions proliferated in this period participation in racing events began to decline to counteract the diminution of interest the beverly yacht club and the new bedford yacht club joined forces in  to sponsor the buzzards bay regatta the three day event has proved most successful attracting over  participants each year a wednesday evening cruising class and rhodes  race series and the clarks cove challenge cup a competition between the new bedford yacht club and the low tide yacht club are also recent popular events the social side continued to flourish with varied activities during the summer season formal dinner dances on saturday nights for seniors highdecibel midweek junior and intermediate dances and informal family gatherings on sunday evenings currently the new bedford yacht club squadron includes sail motor boats and once again a racing shell a full schedule of racing cruising and social events is maintained as the second oldest yacht club in continuous operation on buzzards bay and the tenth oldest new england the club continues to fulfill its original statement of purpose order the recently published book the new bedford yacht club  a history by llewellyn howland iii additional
