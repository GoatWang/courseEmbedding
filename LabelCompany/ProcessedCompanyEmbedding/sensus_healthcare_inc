business   overview   sensus healthcare llc a delaware limited liability company the “company” was formed on may   to design manufacture and market proprietary medical devices specializing in the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancers and other skin conditions such as keloids with superficial radiation therapy in june  sensus healthcare llc a florida limited liability company “sensus fl” acquired all the assets associated with our primary product the srt from topex inc for  million following this acquisition we relaunched the srt under the sensus healthcare brand in december  we merged with sensus fl with the delaware limited liability company surviving the merger for the purpose of changing our domicile from florida to delaware on january   sensus healthcare llc converted into a delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion and we changed our name to sensus healthcare inc as a result of the corporate conversion all holders of units of sensus healthcare llc became holders of common stock of sensus healthcare inc holders of warrants and options to purchase units of sensus healthcare llc became holders of warrants and options to purchase common stock of sensus healthcare inc respectively   the srt is a photon xray low energy superficial radiotherapy system that provides patients an alternative to surgery for treating nonmelanoma skin cancers including basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers and other skin conditions such as keloids the srt is especially effective in treating primary lesions that would otherwise be difficult or require extensive surgery involving sensitive areas of the head and neck regions such as the fold in the nose eyelids lips corner of the mouth and the lining of the ear that would otherwise lead to a less than desirable cosmetic outcome superficial radiation therapy treatment procedures do not require the use of anesthetics and eliminates the need for skin grafting the srt provides healthcare providers and patients with a safe virtually painless and substantially nonscarring treatment option for nonmelanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions such as keloids it allows dermatologists to retain nonmelanoma skin cancer patients rather than referring them to specialists while offering radiation oncologists an alternative to costly linear accelerator–based treatments with a process that is less invasive more timeefficient and improves practice economics our revenue is primarily derived from sales of our srt product line   corporate conversion   on january   we converted from a florida limited liability company to a delaware corporation the purpose of the corporate conversion was to reorganize our corporate structure in advance of our initial public offering or ipo so that we would be a corporation rather than a limited liability company and so that our existing investors own our common stock rather than equity interests in a limited liability company references elsewhere in this annual report on form k to our capitalization and other matters pertaining to our equity and shares prior to the corporate conversion relate to the capitalization and equity and shares of sensus healthcare llc and after the corporate conversion to sensus healthcare inc   initial public offering   on june   we completed an ipo of units consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock in connection with the ipo we issued  units of our common stock at a price of  per unit including  units pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their overallotment option for an aggregate offering price of  million the offer and sale of all of the securities in the ipo were registered under the securities act pursuant to a registration statement on form s as amended file no  which was declared effective by the sec on june   the registration statement registered an aggregate of  units including  units to cover the overallotment option the offering commenced on june   and did not terminate before all of the units in the ipo that were registered in the registration statement were sold northland securities inc and neidiger tucker bruner inc acted as joint bookrunning managers for the offering          we received total net proceeds from the ipo of approximately  million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately  million and other offering expenses of approximately  million   our products and services    srt    we offer the srt product family which we anticipate will be complemented by additional models and options in the future our technology is based on several key needs and requirements including the need for a dedicated and costeffective device for the treatment of skin cancer keloids and other skin conditions the srt provides the following clinical and functional advantages   § easy touch automatic setup procedure  including automatic xray tube warmup procedures § specially designed control console for medical physicists and service technicians providing integrated safety and backup timer controls automatic system conditioning procedures calibration xray output verification and system parameters including last treatment status information § advanced patient record management with integrated enterprise workflow management § compact mobile design with a small ” x ” footprint and unique scissor xray tube arm movements providing a large range of motion for patient access and treatment and § high reliability and mtbf mean time between maintenance performance that assure availability for the patients and practitioners and lower the total cost of ownership   srt vision    the srt vision provides customers with additional options compared to the srt base model these additional options allow for dedicated treatment planning and full treatment progression documentation in a patient’s record the srt vision provides the user with a unique superficial radiation therapytailored treatment planning application that integrates the embedded high frequency ultrasound imaging module volumetric tumor analysis beam margins planning and comprehensive dosimetry parameters this allows the user to precisely and more accurately plan and prescribe the patientspecific treatment course to maximize patient outcomes and workflow efficiency the srt vision also offers a comprehensive control console and workflow management control console that provides full record and verify treatment tracing operatorlevel access and functional control audiovisual patient and treated lesion monitoring and advanced dosimetry setting and tracing   sentinel service program    we offer the sentinel service program which provides our customers comprehensive protection for their srt and srt vision systems at an annual price of approximately  of the system’s list price the sentinel program covers all parts and labor for the period of the contract and one annual preventive maintenance session that includes cooling system maintenance high voltage loop maintenance filters and system cleaning and system touchups should they be required during the preventative maintenance session   through our sentinel service program we also provide turnkey preand postsale services that include the following   § providing a preinstall kit for the contractors to prepare the treatment room § room retrofit and shielding § system shipping coordination and installation § system commissioning by a medical physicist through a national physics network § system registration with the state and daily workflow documentation preparation § clinical applications training with the customer’s superficial radiation therapy staff and § treating the first scheduled patients with our customers onsite applications training          consumables    we sell disposable lead shielding replacements disposable radiation safety items such as aprons and eye shields and disposable applicator tips which are used to treat various sized lesions and different areas of the body   competition    the medical device industry is highly competitive subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other participants our currently marketed products and any future products we commercialize will compete against healthcare providers who use traditional surgical treatment options such as mohs surgery as well as medical device companies that offer other treatment options for the conditions our products are designed to treat as of december   we have three primary medical device company competitors   § xstrahl medical formerly gulmay headquartered in the united kingdom § xoft a subsidiary of icad headquartered in new hampshire § elekta headquartered in georgia   xstrahl medical is an engineering company focused on industrial and research xray therapy devices we believe most of xstrahl medical’s installed base is comprised of legacy orthovoltage machines made up of higher energy devices located in europe   both xoft and elekta offer products that are considered electronic brachytherapy “ebx” devices due to this classification both companies may face challenges in the us and certain other international markets where laws and regulations require that a radiation oncologist medical physicist or radiation therapist be involved with every treatment additionally the cpt® editorial panel has established two new treatment delivery codes for ebx for  including a specific skin code based on typical treatment practices it appears that both ebx products also have limited capabilities as to size of lesions that can be treated and require expensive consumables furthermore ebx products have very limited clinical studies   many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of their products our competitors may also have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do including relationships with our potential customers in addition many of these companies and healthcare providers have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we do because of the size of the skin cancer treatment market and the high growth profile of the segments in which we compete we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products additionally we may also face competition from smaller companies that have developed or are developing similar technologies for our addressable markets we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include   § improved outcomes for medical conditions § acceptance by doctors treating nonmelanoma skin cancer and keloids § potential greater acceptance by the patient community § potential greater ease of use and reliability § product price and qualification for reimbursement § technical leadership and superiority § effective marketing and distribution and § speed to market   we may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors in regard to any one or all of these factors our ability to compete effectively will depend on the acceptance of our products by dermatologists radiation oncologists hospitals and patients and our ability to achieve better clinical outcomes than products developed by our existing or future competitors in addition certain of our competitors could use their superior financial resources to develop products that have features or clinical outcomes similar or superior to our products which would harm our ability to successfully compete          sales and marketing    we focus on two primary markets private dermatology practices and radiation oncologists in both private and hospital settings we currently employ a multitier sales strategy in an attempt to optimize geographic coverage and focus on what we perceive to be our key markets this multitier sales model uses a direct sales force currently  people as well as international dealers and distributors   our dermatology market sales are directed by stephen cohen our executive vice president strategic initiatives and dermatology capitalizing on his prior experience in executive capacities at technicare now johnson  johnson diasonics and xoft our direct sales force for radiation oncology is led by richard golin our executive vice president of sales oncology and dermatology who has prior experience in sales at toshiba medical systems siemens and hologic we plan to continue selling and marketing our products to both the dermatology and radiation oncology markets concurrently   dermatology market    private dermatology practices in the us represent the point of entry for most nonmelanoma skin cancer patients we believe the srt offers dermatologists a competitive advantage by allowing them to retain patients for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer rather than referring them out to specialists for mohs surgery or other radiation procedures in addition to nonmelanoma skin cancers our fdaapproved indications include among others keloids kaposi’s sarcoma actinic keratosis metatypic carcinoma cutaneous appendage carcinoma and other malignant skin tumors we are continuing to drive our research and development to expand our indications into new areas of treatment   radiation oncology market    for licensed radiation oncologists in the us we believe the srt offers a simpler faster method of treatment with a better overall patient experience our srt system offers the ability to free up more expensive radiation equipment such as linear accelerators for more complex procedures while providing patients with effective noninvasive treatment options for nonmelanoma skin cancer   other markets    as of december   we also believe that both plastic and general surgery markets present growth opportunities for our product offerings with fda clearance to treat keloids through superficial radiation therapy many plastic surgeons are recognizing the opportunity to be able to provide an effective treatment solution for this benign tumor additionally we believe that plastic surgeons view the nonmelanoma skin cancer market as a growth opportunity that can supplement their existing services we believe there is an opportunity to also provide superficial radiation therapy in a prophylactic manner for various surgical procedures to reduce the formation of keloids within the new healthcare reform environment superficial radiation therapy can provide hospitals and surgery centers with a direct measurable impact on clinical outcomes for certain procedures including joint replacement procedures bypass surgery and obgyncsection procedures among others   global focus   as of december   we have an installed base of over  units in  countries our customer list includes leading cancer centers dermatology practices hospitals and plastic surgery clinics which we believe further validates our targeted marketing approach led by our direct sales teams and our global distribution partners   manufacturing and supply    we currently use a third party located in the us to manufacture our products in july  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with rbm services llc “rbm” pursuant to which rbm agreed to manufacture our srt products based on an annual month sales forecast and rolling sixmonth sales forecast we pay a fixed price per unit under the terms of this agreement subject to annual adjustments due to changes in the costs of materials the initial term of this agreement was three years with successive oneyear renewals thereafter we continue to do business with rbm although we or rbm may terminate the agreement with  days’ written notice or upon at least  days’ notice prior to the end of each additional oneyear renewal period we believe our third party manufacturer meets fda international organization for standardization or iso and other quality standards we maintain internal policies procedures and supplier management processes to ensure that our third party manufacturer is meeting applicable quality standards to date we have not experienced any difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to meet demand for our products and we believe manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet global market demand for our products for the foreseeable future          we believe this third party manufacturing relationship initially allowed us to work with a supplier that has welldeveloped specific competencies while minimizing our capital investment controlling costs and shortening cycle times all of which we believe allowed us to compete with our competitors however we are exploring the possibility of reducing our reliance on third party manufacturers by bringing certain manufacturing functions inhouse which could include the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets or the acquisition or lease of a manufacturing facility   we have a single preferred supplier for the xray tubes used in our products we believe our preferred supplier has a superior product however we believe that the products of alternate suppliers would be adequate for our products we do not have a contractual relationship with our preferred supplier however we do not anticipate any material disruptions to our supply of xray tubes adequate xray tubes are readily accessible from alternate suppliers   intellectual property   we actively seek to protect the intellectual property we believe is important to our business including seeking and maintaining patents that cover our products we also rely on trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand    we own two issued us patents which expire in  our patents pertain to technology in the specialized field of superficial radiotherapy treatment the following patents were issued between august  and september  and were assigned to us when we acquired the technology from topex    § us patent no  radiation therapy system with risk mitigation § us patent no  radiation therapy system featuring rotatable filter assembly   the following patent application is pending in the us china and russia and was submitted in    § us patent application no  hybrid ultrasoundguided superficial radiotherapy system and method published as us patent application no  a   three provisional patent applications are pending and additional provisional patent applications are in process   as of december   we also owned three us trademark registrations and other trademark applications are pending   we also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary rights to develop and maintain our competitive position we seek to protect our unpatented proprietary rights through a variety of methods including confidentiality agreements with employees consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information we also require our employees to execute invention assignment agreements with respect to inventions arising from their employment          we acquired the photon xray low energy or superficial xray therapy system dubbed the srt and developed a next generation system — the srt vision which are each designed specifically to treat skin cancer and keloids as an alternative to surgery since first introduced in may  by topex over  patients have been successfully treated with the srt system the treatment of keloids has now begun at several sites throughout the world including the us and china we are in the process of authoring and preparing additional forwardlooking patents   no patents or trademarks may ever be issued or be registered from our pending or future applications for such intellectual property even if such patents or trademarks are respectively issued or registered they or any of our other intellectual property may not provide us with any meaningful protection or competitive advantage our intellectual property could be challenged invalidated circumvented infringed or misappropriated in addition third parties have claimed and in the future may claim that we our customers licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights   government regulation   our business is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws and regulations including those relating to the protection of the environment health and safety some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations in addition these laws and their interpretations are subject to change or new laws may be enacted both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts we believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with all applicable legal requirements however it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise we discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business for the years ended december   and  we incurred approximately  and  respectively in expenses related to regulatory compliance and quality standards   us food and drug administration fda regulation of medical devices    the federal food drug and cosmetic act or fdca and fda regulations establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use our products include medical devices that are subject to these as well as other federal state and local laws and regulations fda is responsible for the overall enforcement of quality regulatory and statutory requirements governing medical devices our regulated medical devices include our srt product line   fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes — class i class ii or class iii — depending on their level of risk and the types of controls that are necessary to assure device safety and effectiveness the class assignment determines the type of premarketing submission or application if any that will be required before marketing in the us our devices are class ii devices under the fda’s classification system   § class i devices present a low risk and are not lifesustaining or lifesupporting the majority of class i devices are subject only to “general controls” — eg prohibition against adulteration and misbranding registration and listing good manufacturing practices labeling and adverse event reporting general controls are baseline requirements that apply to all classes of medical devices   § class ii devices present a moderate risk and are devices for which general controls alone are not sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness devices in class ii are subject to both general controls and “special controls” — eg special labeling compliance with industry standards and postmarket surveillance unless exempted class ii devices typically require fda clearance before marketing through the premarket notification k process in accordance with  cfr part  requirements          § class iii devices present the highest risk these devices generally are lifesustaining lifesupporting or for a use that is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury class iii devices are devices for which general controls by themselves are insufficient and for which there is insufficient information to establish special controls to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness class iii devices are subject to general controls and typically require approval of a premarket approval application or pma in accordance with  cfr part  before marketing   unless it is exempt from premarket review requirements a medical device must receive marketing authorization from the fda prior to being commercially distributed in the us the most common pathways for obtaining marketing authorization are k clearance and pma with the enactment of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act or the fdasia the availability of a  de novo  pathway was facilitated for certain low to moderaterisk devices that do not qualify for the k pathway due to the absence of a predicate device   k pathway    as of december   all of our products are subject to the k requirement or are exempt from the k requirement the k review process compares a new device to a legally marketed device through the k process fda determines whether a new medical device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device ie predicate device that is not subject to pma requirements “substantial equivalence” means that the proposed device a has the same intended use as the predicate device b the same or similar technological characteristics c the information submitted in the k demonstrates that the proposed device is as safe and effective as the predicate device and d the proposed device does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device   to obtain k clearance we must submit a k application containing sufficient information and data to demonstrate that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device this data generally includes nonclinical performance testing eg software validation bench testing electrical safety testing but may also include clinical data typically it takes approximately four months for fda to complete its review of a k submission however it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured during its review of a k fda may request additional information including clinical data which may significantly prolong the review process after completing its review of a k fda may issue an order in the form of a letter that finds the device to be either  substantially equivalent and states that the device can be marketed in the us or  not substantially equivalent and states that device cannot be marketed in the us depending upon the reasons for the not substantially equivalent finding the device may need to be approved through the pma pathway discussed below prior to commercialization a new medical device for which there is no substantially equivalent device is automatically designated a class iii device depending on the nature of the new device the manufacturer may ask the fda to make a riskbased determination of the new device and reclassify it in class i or class ii this process is referred to as the  de novo  process if the fda agrees the new device will be reassigned to the appropriate other class if the fda does not agree the manufacturer will have to submit a pma we have received fda clearances for our srt and srt vision   after a device receives k clearance any modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that would constitute a major change in its intended use including significant modifications to any of our products requires submission and clearance of a new k fda relies on each manufacturer to make and document this determination initially but fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination we have made and plan to continue to make minor product enhancements that we believe do not require new k clearances however we expect to confer with fda on planned changes that may require a special abbreviated or traditional k submission if fda disagrees with our determination regarding whether a new k clearance was required for these modifications we may need to cease marketing or recall the modified device fda may also subject us to other enforcement actions including but not limited to issuing a warning letter or untitled letter to us seizing our products imposing civil penalties or initiating criminal prosecution          premarket approval pathway    as of december   we do not market any devices that are subject to pma requirements unlike the comparative standard of the k pathway the pma approval process requires an independent demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of a device pma is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by fda pma approval is based on a determination by fda that the pma contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses a pma application generally includes extensive information about the device including the results of clinical testing conducted on the device and a detailed description of the manufacturing process   after a pma application is accepted for review fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information fda regulations provide  days to review the pma and make a determination however in reality the review time is normally longer eg  –  years during this review period fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside fda may be convened to review and evaluate the data supporting the application and provide recommendations to fda as to whether the data provide a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use in addition fda generally will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation or qsr which imposes comprehensive development testing control documentation and other quality assurance requirements for the design and manufacturing of a medical device   based on its review fda may  issue an order approving the pma  issue a letter stating the pma is “approvable” eg minor additional information is needed  issue a letter stating the pma is “not approvable” or  issue an order denying pma a company may not market a device subject to pma review until fda issues an order approving the pma as part of a pma approval fda may impose postapproval conditions intended to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of the device including among other things restrictions on labeling promotion sale and distribution and requiring the collection of additional clinical data failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action including withdrawal of the approval most modifications to a pma approved device including changes to the design labeling or manufacturing process require prior approval before being implemented prior approval is obtained through submission of a pma supplement the type of information required to support a pma supplement and fda’s time for review of a pma supplement vary depending on the nature of the modification   clinical trials    clinical trials of medical devices in the us are governed by fda’s investigational device exemption regulation in accordance with  cfr part  this regulation places significant responsibility on the sponsor of the clinical study including but not limited to choosing qualified investigators monitoring the trial submitting required reports maintaining required records and assuring investigators obtain informed consent comply with the study protocol control the disposition of the investigational device submit required reports etc   clinical trials of significant risk devices eg implants devices used in supporting or sustaining human life devices of substantial importance in diagnosing curing mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health require fda and institutional review board approval prior to starting the trial fda approval is obtained through submission of an investigational device exemption application clinical trials of nonsignificant risk devices ie devices that do not meet the regulatory definition of a significant risk device only require institutional review board approval before starting the clinical trial sponsor is responsible for making the initial determination of whether a clinical study is significant risk or nonsignificant risk however a reviewing institutional review board or the fda may review this decision and disagree with the determination   an investigational device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data such as performance data animal and laboratory testing results showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the clinical study protocol is scientifically sound there is no assurance that submission of an investigational device exemption will result in the ability to commence clinical trials additionally after a trial begins fda may place it on hold or terminate it if among other reasons it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk as noted above fda may require a company to collect clinical data on a device in the postmarket setting the collection of such data may be required as a condition of pma approval fda also has the authority to order via a letter a postmarket surveillance study in accordance with  cfr part  for certain devices at any time after they have been cleared or approved we do not expect to launch clinical trials subject to the investigational device exemption regulations for future products also our products are not currently subject to any required postmarket surveillance studies          pervasive and continuing fda regulation    after a device is entered into commerce in the us regardless of its classification or premarket pathway numerous additional fda requirements generally apply these include   § establishment registration and device listing requirements in accordance with  cfr part  § quality system regulation requirements which govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging labeling storage installation and servicing of finished devices in accordance with  cfr part  § labeling requirements which mandate the inclusion of certain content in device labels and labeling and which also prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved ie “offlabel” uses § medical device reporting regulation which requires that manufacturers and importers report to fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur in accordance with  cfr part  and § reports of corrections and removals regulation which requires that manufacturers and importers report to fda recalls ie corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the fdca that may present a risk to health manufacturers and importers must keep records of recalls that they determine to be not reportable in accordance with  cfr part    fda enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by fda which may include but is not limited to the following sanctions   § issuance of form  observations during a facilities inspection § untitled letters or warning letters § fines injunctions and civil penalties § consent decree which forces improvements in the quality management system through the use of the federal courts § recall or seizure of our products § operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production § refusing our request for k clearance or premarket approval of new products § withdrawing k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and § criminal prosecution   we are subject to unannounced establishment inspections by fda as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation of and compliance with applicable state public health regulations these inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities   international    international sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations which vary substantially from country to country in order to market our products in other countries we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries the time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance or approval and the requirements may differ the european unioneuropean economic area or eueea requires a ce conformity mark in order to market medical devices many other countries such as australia india new zealand pakistan and sri lanka accept ce or fda clearance or approval although others such as china brazil canada and japan require separate regulatory filings          in the eea our devices are required to comply with the essential requirements of the eu medical devices directive eec compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the ce marking of conformity to our medical devices without which they cannot be commercialized in the eea to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the ce marking of conformity we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification except for low risk medical devices class i where the manufacturer can issue an ec declaration of conformity based on a selfassessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the medical devices directive a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body which is an organization accredited by a member state of the eea to conduct conformity assessments the notified body would typically audit and examine the quality system for the manufacture design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a certification demonstrating compliance with the essential requirements based on this certification we can draw up an ec declaration of conformity which allows us to affix the ce mark to our products   further the advertising and promotion of our products in the eea is subject to the laws of individual eea member states implementing the eu medical devices directive directive ec concerning misleading and comparative advertising and directive ec on unfair commercial practices as well as other eea member state laws governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices these laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals   we have obtained approval to sell our products in europe china israel and russia and we are seeking approval in several other counties   sales and marketing commercial compliance    federal antikickback laws and regulations prohibit among other things persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or paying remuneration directly or indirectly in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual or the purchase order or recommendation of any good or service paid for under federal healthcare programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs possible sanctions for violation of these antikickback laws include monetary fines civil and criminal penalties exclusion from medicare and medicaid programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions   in addition federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to get a false claim paid offlabel promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal false claims laws pursuant to fda regulations we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by fda based on their medical judgment we are prohibited from promoting products for such offlabel uses additionally the majority of states in which we market our products have similar antikickback false claims antifee splitting and selfreferral laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor including commercial insurers and violations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties   to enforce compliance with the federal laws the us department of justice or doj has increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry dealing with investigations can be time and resourceconsuming additionally if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the doj or other law enforcement agencies the company may be required to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement   the us and foreign government regulators have increased regulation enforcement inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry including increased us government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act whenever a governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations that authority can impose fines delay or suspend regulatory clearances institute proceedings to detain or seize our products issue a recall impose operating restrictions enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and can recommend criminal prosecution moreover governmental authorities can ban or request the recall repair replacement or refund of the cost of devices we distribute          additionally the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry as some states including california massachusetts and vermont mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs along with the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians the affordable care act also imposes reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers device manufacturers are also required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of  per year and up to an aggregate of  million per year for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission the shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements   healthcare fraud and abuse    healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under medicare medicaid or most other federally funded healthcare programs the federal antikickback statute prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded healthcare programs such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by medicare or medicaid the antikickback statute is subject to evolving interpretations for example the government has enforced the antikickback statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consultant arrangements with physicians the majority of states also have antikickback laws which establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor including commercial insurers further recently enacted amendments to the affordable care act among other things amend the intent requirement of the federal antikickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in addition the affordable care act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including for example exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare or medicaid in addition to the antikickback statute the federal physician selfreferral statute commonly known as the stark law prohibits physicians who have a financial relationship with an entity including an investment ownership or compensation relationship from referring medicare patients for designated health services which include clinical pathology services unless an exception applies similarly entities may not bill medicare or any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral many states have their own selfreferral laws as well which in some cases apply to all third party payors not just medicare and medicaid if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with the stark law or state selfreferral laws and regulations our pathology laboratory business could be subject to severe financial consequences including the obligation to refund amounts billed to third party payors in violation of such laws civil penalties and potentially also exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs like medicare and medicaid the stark law often is enforced through lawsuits brought under the federal false claims act violations of which trigger significant monetary penalties and treble damages   additionally the civil false claims act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the us government actions under the false claims act may be brought by the attorney general or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government violations of the false claims act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages the federal government is using the false claims act and the accompanying threat of significant liability in its investigations of healthcare providers and suppliers throughout the country for a wide variety of medicare billing practices and has obtained multimillion and multibillion dollar settlements in addition to individual criminal convictions given the significant size of actual and potential settlements it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws          health information privacy    the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of  or hitech and their respective implementing regulations impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers health plans and healthcare clearinghouses known as covered entities as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information the hipaa privacy and security regulations including the expanded requirements under hitech establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities and their business associates in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality integrity and security of protected health information   we have implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations as required by law the privacy and security regulations establish a “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent therefore we are required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws in addition for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries we must comply with the laws of those other countries the federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data without patient authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations hipaa as amended by hitech provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties if we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information we could be subject to monetary fines civil penalties or criminal sanctions in addition other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues for example we could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information if we were to experience a breach of protected health information we could be subject to significant adverse publicity in addition to possible enforcement sanctions and civil damages lawsuits finally we may be required to incur additional costs related to ongoing hipaa compliance as may be necessary to address evolving interpretations and enforcement of hipaa and other health information privacy and security laws the enactment of new laws or regulations emerging cybersecurity threats and other factors   research and development   research and development costs relate to our products under development and quality and regulatory costs and are expensed as incurred during the years ended december   and  we incurred research and development expense of approximately  million and  million respectively we expect the amount of our research and development or rd expense to increase as we continue to innovate and introduce new products and technologies   employees    as of december   we had  employees all in the us none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our relationship with our employees to be good   website   our filings with the sec are available free of charge through our website wwwsensushealthcarecom  the information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report   item a risk factors   an investment in our common stock contains a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial materialize the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing the risks described below you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules and other filings with the sec this annual report on form k also contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this annual report on form k these risks and uncertainties include the following          risks related to our business    we have a history of net losses if we do not consistently achieve profitability our financial condition and the value of our common stock could suffer    we have a history of net losses our historical losses from inception through december   totaled approximately  million if our revenue grows more slowly than currently anticipated or if operating expenses are higher than expected we may be unable to consistently achieve profitability our financial condition will suffer and the value of our common stock could decline even if we are successful increasing our sales we may incur losses in the foreseeable future as we continue to research and develop and seek regulatory approvals for our products if sales revenue from any of our currently cleared products or any additional products that receive marketing clearance from the fda or approval from other regulatory authorities in the future is insufficient or if our product development is delayed we may be unable to achieve profitability furthermore even if we are able to achieve profitability we may be unable to sustain or increase such profitability on a quarterly or annual basis which would significantly reduce the value of our common stock   if thirdparty payors do not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the use of our products it is unlikely that our products will be widely used and our revenue will be negatively impacted    in the us the commercial success of our existing products and any future products will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payors at the federal and state levels including medicare and medicaid private health insurers and other thirdparty payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for procedures using our products the existence of coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products and related procedures by government and private payors is critical to market acceptance of our existing and future products neither hospitals nor physicians are likely to use our products if they do not receive adequate reimbursement payments for the procedures using our products   some private payors in the us may base their reimbursement policies on the coverage decisions determined by the cms which administers the medicare program others may adopt different coverage or reimbursement policies for procedures performed using our products while some governmental programs such as medicaid have reimbursement policies that vary from state to state some of which may not pay for our products in an amount that supports our selling price if at all a medicare national or local coverage decision denying coverage for any of the procedures performed with our products could result in private and other thirdparty payors also denying coverage medicare part b and a number of private insurers in the us currently cover and pay for both nonmelanoma skin cancer and keloid treatments using the srt a withdrawal or even contemplation of a withdrawal by cms medicaid or private payors of reimbursements or any other unfavorable coverage or reimbursement decisions by government programs or private payors could have a material adverse effect on our business   reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a countrybycountry basis in many international markets a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be cleared for sale in that country further many international markets have governmentmanaged healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures in most markets there are private insurance systems as well as governmentmanaged systems our products may not be considered costeffective by international thirdparty payors or governments managing healthcare systems furthermore reimbursement may not be available or if available thirdparty payors’ reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably if sufficient coverage and reimbursement are not available for our current or future products in either the us or internationally the demand for our products and consequently our revenues will be adversely affected          substantially all of our revenue is generated from the sale of our srt and related products and any decline in the sales of these products or failure to gain market acceptance of these products will negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations    we have focused heavily on the development and commercialization of a limited number of products for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions with superficial radiotherapy from our inception in  through december   substantially all of our revenue has been derived from sales of our srt product line and related services and ancillary products we expect substantially all of our revenue to be derived from or related to sales of our srt product line for the foreseeable future besides differentiated or enhanced versions of the srt and ancillary products we are not currently developing or otherwise investing in any other product if we are unable to achieve and maintain significantly greater market acceptance of superficial radiotherapy for treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions or if we do not achieve sustained positive cash flow then we will be severely constrained in our ability to fund our operations in addition if we are unable to market our srt product line and ancillary products as a result of a quality problem shortage of components required to for assembly failure to maintain or obtain regulatory approvals unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects related to the srt product line and ancillary products we would lose our only source of revenue and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected   we may be unable to manufacture our products in quantities sufficient to meet existing demand levels which would hinder our ability to effectively commercialize our products and increase revenues    the manufacture of medical devices requires significant expertise and capital investment including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls from us and our key suppliers to scale up the production process to manufacture sufficient quantities at high volume and with satisfactory production yields manufacturers of medical devices often encounter difficulties in production particularly when scaling up initial production these problems include difficulties with production costs and yields quality control and assurance and shortages of qualified personnel as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal state and foreign regulations in july  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with an unrelated third party for manufacturing and production of the srt in accordance with our specifications we continue to do business with the manufacturer pursuant to this agreement although we or the manufacturer may terminate the agreement with  days’ written notice or upon at least  days’ notice prior to the end of each additional oneyear renewal period as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k we are exploring the possibility of using a portion of the proceeds of our ipo to begin reducing our reliance on third party manufacturers by bringing certain manufacturing capabilities inhouse however if eventually implemented our plan to bring the manufacturing function inhouse may not be successful and we may be unable to maintain a relationship with our current manufacturer or establish a relationship with another manufacturer on favorable terms if at all   consequently we may not with our third party suppliers be able to continue to efficiently manufacture our products in sufficient quantities to meet projected demand or to establish sufficient worldwide inventory to fully support our distribution network any of these results could cause us to be unable to effectively commercialize our products or increase revenue adversely affecting our business financial condition results of operations and the value of our common stock   we have a single preferred supplier for the xray tubes used in our products and the loss of this preferred supplier could adversely affect us   we have a single preferred supplier for the xray tubes used in our products although other suppliers exist in the market the loss of this preferred supplier or their inability to supply us or our third party manufacturer with adequate components could hinder our ability to effectively produce our products to meet existing demand levels especially if we were unable to timely procure xray tubes from another supplier in the market which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and increase our revenues          we may be unable to retain and develop our us sales force and nonus distributors which would adversely affect our ability to meet our revenue targets and other goals    as we launch products increase current sales efforts and expand into new geographies we will need to retain grow and develop our direct sales personnel distributors and agents there is significant competition for sales personnel experienced in relevant medical device sales in addition the training process is lengthy because it requires significant education for new sales representatives to achieve an acceptable level of clinical competency with our products upon completion of training sales representatives typically require lead time in the field to develop or expand their network of accounts and achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach in any individual territory if we are unable to attract motivate develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel or if the sales representatives do not achieve the productivity levels expected our revenue will not grow as expected and our financial performance will suffer   in addition we may not succeed in entering into and maintaining productive arrangements with an adequate number of distributors outside of the us that are sufficiently committed to selling our products in international markets the establishment and maintenance of a distribution network is expensive and time consuming even if we engage and maintain suitable relationships with an adequate number of distributors they may not generate revenue as quickly as we expect them to commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products or ultimately succeed in selling our products moreover if our sales force and distributors are unable to attract and retain new customers we may be unable to achieve our expected growth and our business could suffer furthermore some of our distributors may market or sell the products of our competitors in these cases the competitors may have the ability to influence the products that our distributors choose to market and sell for example by offering higher commission payments or by convincing the distributors to terminate their relationships with us carry fewer of our products or reduce their sales and marketing efforts for our products any of the foregoing would hinder our ability to meet our revenue targets and other goals   the future worldwide demand for our current products and our future products is uncertain our current products and our future products may not be accepted by hospitals physicians or patients and may not become commercially successful    physicians and hospitals may not perceive the benefits of our products and may be reluctant or unwilling to adopt our products as a treatment option particularly in light of existing treatment options such as mohs surgery or high dose rate brachytherapy additionally physicians and hospitals may not be aware of the significant advances in technology associated with superficial radiation therapy compared to older technology that was previously used with orthovoltage while we believe that our products are an efficient and less invasive alternative to other treatments of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions physicians who are accustomed to using other modalities to treat patients with either nonmelanoma skin cancer keloids or other skin conditions may be reluctant to adopt broad use of our superficial radiotherapy products   we must grow markets for our products through physician education and awareness programs publication in peerreviewed medical journals of results from studies using our products will be an important consideration in their adoption by physicians and in reimbursement decisions of thirdparty payors the process of publication in leading medical journals is subject to a peerreview process peer reviewers may not consider the results of studies of our products and any future products sufficiently novel or worthy of publication failure to have studies of our products published in peer reviewed journals may adversely affect adoption of our products   educating physicians and hospitals on the benefits of our products and advancements in superficial radiation technology requires a significant commitment by our marketing team and sales organization our products may not become widely accepted by physicians and hospitals if we are unable to educate physicians and hospitals about the advantages of our products do not achieve significantly greater market acceptance of our products do not gain momentum in our sales activities or fail to significantly grow our market share we will be unable to grow our revenue and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected          we are in a highly competitive market segment which is subject to rapid technological change if our competitors are able to develop and market products that are more effective less costly easier to use or otherwise more attractive than any of our products our business will be adversely impacted    the medical device industry is highly competitive and subject to technological change in the arena for technology and products for use in the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions we have three primary competitors one of which operates in the superficial radiotherapy space largely in the european market and the other two of which operate in the brachytherapy space in both the us and internationally while we believe our srt and related products currently have certain competitive advantages over the products offered by these competitors our success depends in part upon our ability to maintain this competitive position if these competitors improve their existing products develop new products or expand their operations we may be unable to maintain our competitive advantages over these competitors   furthermore new competitors including companies larger than us may enter the market in the future and may offer products with similar or alternative functionalities these companies may enjoy several advantages relative to us including   § greater financial and human resources for product development sales and marketing § greater name recognition § longestablished relationships with physicians and hospitals § the ability to offer rebates or bundle multiple product offerings to offer greater discounts or incentives § more established distribution channels and sales and marketing capabilities and § greater experience in and resources for conducting research and development clinical studies manufacturing preparing regulatory submissions obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products and marketing cleared products   hospitals physicians and investors may not view our products as competitive with other products that are marketed and sold by new competitors including much larger and more established companies our competitors may develop and patent processes or products earlier than we do obtain regulatory clearance or approvals for competing products more rapidly than us or develop more effective more convenient or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or less competitive if our existing or new competitors are more successful than us in any of these matters our business may be harmed   our customers are concentrated in the us and china and economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies or patterns of our customers in these countries could have a significant impact on our business and operating results    substantially all of our  and  sales were made to customers located in the us and china for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively of our product sales were to chinese customers with substantially the remainder of our sales to customers in the us because of our geographic concentrations our revenue could fluctuate significantly due to changes in economic conditions the use of competitive products or the loss of reduction of business with or less favorable terms within these countries a reduction or delay in orders for our products from these countries could materially harm our business and results of operations   our future success depends on our ability to develop receive regulatory approval for and introduce new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market in a timely manner and if we do not do so our results of operations will suffer    it is important to our business that we continue to build a pipeline of product offerings for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other skin conditions to remain competitive consequently our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products however we may be unable to successfully maintain our regulatory clearance for existing products or develop obtain and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for product enhancements or new products or these products may not be accepted by physicians or the payors who financially support many of the procedures performed with our products   the success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on several factors including our ability to   § identify and anticipate physician and patient needs properly § develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner § avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties          § demonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products with data § obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for new products or product enhancements § comply fully with us food and drug administration and applicable foreign government agencies’ regulations on marketing of new devices or modified products § provide adequate training to potential users of our products and § receive coverage and adequate reimbursement for procedures performed with our products   if we do not develop new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements or if competitors introduce new products with enhanced functionalities that are superior to those of ours then our results of operations will suffer   our products may become obsolete prior to the end of their anticipated useful lives and we may be required to dispose of existing inventory or write off the value or accelerate the depreciation of the these assets each which would materially and adversely impact our results of operations    we focus on continual product innovation and product improvement while we believe this provides a competitive edge it also results in the risk that our products will become obsolete prior to the end of their anticipated useful lives if we introduce new products or nextgeneration products prior to the end of the useful life of a prior generation we may be required to dispose of existing inventory or write off the value of the these assets each of which would materially and adversely impact our results of operations   our success is dependent in large part on our being an early reentrant into the market for our proprietary superficial radiotherapy systems and if one or more competitors join us in the market our marketing efforts and ability to compete would be materially and adversely affected    our success is dependent in large part on our being an early reentrant into the market for our proprietary superficial radiotherapy systems if one or more competitors join us in the market the increased competition would require us to devote substantial additional resources to our marketing efforts and our ability to compete may be severely impaired   our international operations subject us to certain operating risks which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition    the sale and shipment of our products across international borders as well as the purchase of components from international sources subjects us to us and foreign governmental trade import and export and customs regulations and laws compliance with these regulations and laws is costly and exposes us to penalties for noncompliance other laws and regulations that can significantly impact us include various antibribery laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act and antiboycott laws as well as export control laws any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include but are not limited to significant criminal civil and administrative penalties including imprisonment of individuals fines and penalties denial of export privileges seizure of shipments restrictions on certain business activities and exclusion or debarment from government contracting also the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities any of the foregoing would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition   our international operations and our international distributors expose us to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions these risks include without limitation   § difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights § pricing pressure that we may experience internationally § a shortage of highquality sales people and distributors § thirdparty reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who are treated with our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our products § disadvantage to competition with established business and customer relationships § the imposition of additional us and foreign governmental controls or regulations § economic instability          § changes in duties and tariffs license obligations and other nontariff barriers to trade § the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents representatives and distributors § potentially adverse tax consequences § laws and business practices favoring local companies § difficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines § the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements § the imposition of us or international sanctions against a country company person or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country company person or entity and § the imposition of new trade restrictions   if any of these events or circumstances were to occur our sales in foreign countries would be harmed and our results of operations would suffer   our us business could be adversely affected by changes in international trade regulation   the us presidential administration that came to power in january  and members of the us congress have indicated that they may seek to impose importation tariffs from certain countries such as china and mexico andor to impose taxes on imported goods generally certain countries have publicly stated that they would respond inkind to any such action by the us any future escalation of protectionist trade measures could increase the prices of products components and supplies that we source internationally as well as adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets in addition the trump administration will appoint and employ many new public officials into positions of authority in the us federal government dealing with the healthcare industries that may potentially have a negative impact on the prices and the regulatory pathways for certain healthcare products such as those developed marketed and sold by us such changes in the regulatory pathways could adversely affect and or delay our ability to market and sell our products in the us and internationally   our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter which may negatively impact the value of our securities    our quarterly revenues and results of operations may fluctuate due to the following reasons among others   § physician and hospital acceptance of our products § the timing expense and results of research and development activities and obtaining future regulatory approvals § fluctuations in expenses associated with expanding operations § the introduction of new products and technologies by competitors § sales representatives’ productivity § supplier manufacturing or quality problems with products § the timing of stocking orders from distributors § changes in our pricing policies or in the pricing policies of competitors or suppliers and § changes in thirdparty payors’ reimbursement policies   because of these and other related or similar factors it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet expectations   we may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel which could adversely and materially affect our competitive position    our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key employees we may be unable to attract or retain qualified management and other key personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among companies in the medical device business and related industries particularly in the south florida area where we are headquartered the medical device industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years consequently we could have difficulty attracting or retaining experienced personnel and may be required to spend significant time and expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts many of the other medical device companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources and risk profiles different from ours they also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than that which we may offer if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives we may have difficulty implementing our business strategy and achieving our business objectives          product liability claims could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business    the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices each carry an inherent risk of product liability claims and other damage claims in addition to the exposure we may have for defective products physicians may misuse our products or use improper techniques regardless of how well trained potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability a product liability or other damages claim product recall or product misuse could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation regardless of the ultimate outcome or to pay significant damages and could seriously harm our business   we maintain liability insurance coverage that management believes to be reasonable based on our business and operations however our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all claims made against us our insurance policies generally must be renewed on an annual basis we may be unable to maintain or increase insurance on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs a successful claim brought against us in excess or outside of our insurance coverage could seriously harm our financial condition or results of operations   we may be required to obtain additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all    our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception and we anticipate that our expenses will increase as we continue to grow our business we may need to seek additional capital in the future our growth will depend in part on our ability to develop variations of the srt and other products and related technology complementary to our products our existing financial resources including our existing revolving line of credit may not allow us to conduct all of the activities that we believe would be beneficial for our future growth   we may need to seek funds in the future our existing revolving line of credit restricts our ability to incur certain indebtedness or permit certain encumbrances on our assets without the prior written consent of the lender if we are unable to raise funds on favorable terms or at all we may not be able to support our commercialization efforts or increase our research and development activities or meet our debt and other contractual obligations and the growth of our business may be negatively impacted as a result we may be unable to compete effectively   our cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors including   § the results of commercialization efforts for products § the need for additional capital to fund development programs § the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property § the establishment of highvolume manufacturing and increased sales marketing and distribution capabilities and § success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties   we may be unable to raise funds on favorable terms or at all and either case would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our strategy and meet our goals   to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities stockholders’ ownership interest will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect common stockholders’ rights debt financing if available may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring distributions or dividends if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us any of these events could adversely affect our ability to declare dividends on our common stock and to achieve our product development and commercialization goals and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations          our revolving credit facility imposes substantial restrictions on us some of which could hinder our ability to conduct our operations effectively or otherwise in accordance with our business plan    in march  we entered into a  million revolving credit facility which was amended in march  to extend the facility and to reduce the facility to  million the maximum borrowing is limited by our eligible borrowing base equal to  of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the facility agreement on september   a second amendment to the credit facility extended the facility through september   increased the maximum borrowing to  million and expanded the eligible accounts receivable to include certain international receivables   under the facility agreement we must pay monthly interest at a rate of the prime rate plus  and must pay any outstanding principal and interest on or before the maturity date the facility is secured by all of our assets and limits the amount of additional indebtedness restricts the sale disposition or transfer of our assets and requires the maintenance of a certain monthly adjusted quick ratio restrictive covenant and minimum quarterly ebitda restrictive covenant as defined in the agreement we were not in compliance with certain of these financial covenants as of october   and november   but we received a formal waiver from the bank in february  for our noncompliance we were in compliance as of december     additionally the facility agreement contains a number of negative covenants that require us to seek the lender’s prior written consent in order to conduct certain activities for example we may not without the prior written consent of the lender   § sell or otherwise transfer all or any part of our business or property except for transfers in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise permitted by the facility agreement § change the nature of our business liquidate or dissolve undergo a change in management § add any new offices or business locations including warehouses § change our jurisdiction of organization our organizational structure or type our legal name or any organizational number assigned to us § merge or consolidate with any other person or entity or acquire all or substantially all of the capital stock or property of another person or entity § create incur or be liable for any indebtedness other than as permitted by the facility agreement § create incur or suffer any lien on any of our property including receivables other than as permitted by the facility agreement § maintain any operating or deposit or security accounts other than with the lender or any of its affiliates § pay any dividends or make any distribution or payment or redeem retire or purchase any capital stock except that we may pay dividends solely in common stock or § directly or indirectly make any investment including without limitation by the formation of any subsidiary other than as permitted by the facility agreement   in the event we wish to conduct any of the foregoing activities and the lender refuses to provide its prior written consent our ability to conduct our operations effectively and in accordance with our business plan could be materially and adversely affected   we did not have any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december     if we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth our business could suffer    our strategy involves substantial growth if we experience periods of rapid growth and expansion our limited personnel operational infrastructure and other resources could be significantly strained in particular the possible internalization of manufacturing and continued expansion of our direct sales force in the us will require significant management financial and other supporting resources in addition in order to manage expanding operations we will need to continue to improve our operational and management controls reporting and information technology systems and financial internal control procedures if we are unable to manage our growth effectively it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our operating results and business could suffer any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our goals to achieve our revenue goals we must successfully increase production output to meet projected customer demand we may be unable to increase output on the timeline anticipated if at all also we may in the future experience difficulties with production yields and quality control component supply and shortages of qualified personnel among other problems these problems could result in delays in product availability and increases in expenses any delay or increased expense could adversely affect our ability to increase revenues          costcontainment efforts of our customers purchasing groups and governmental organizations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability    in an effort to reduce costs many hospitals or physicians within the us and abroad are members of group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks negotiate pricing arrangements with medical device companies and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals physicians and other members group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks typically award contracts on a categorybycategory basis through a competitive bidding process bids are generally solicited from multiple providers with the intention of driving down pricing or reducing the number of vendors due to the highly competitive nature of the group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks contracting processes we may be unable to obtain or maintain contract positions with major group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks furthermore the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products thereby reducing our profitability   while having a contract with a group purchasing organizations or integrated delivery networks for a given product category can facilitate sales to members of that group purchasing organizations or integrated delivery networks expected sales levels may not be achieved as sales are typically made pursuant to purchase orders even when a provider is the sole contracted supplier of a group purchasing organization or integrated delivery network for a certain product category members of the group purchasing organization or integrated delivery network generally are free to purchase from other suppliers furthermore group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks contracts typically are terminable without cause by the group purchasing organizations or integrated delivery networks upon  to  days’ notice accordingly even if we obtain contracts with any group purchasing organizations or integrated delivery networks the members of these groups may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by competitors which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability   we depend on information technology systems to operate our business and a cyberattack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business    we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations our information technology systems could be vulnerable to a cyberattack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption any successful attacks could result in the theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information or disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and our systems could be the target of malware and other cyberattacks we have invested in our systems and the protection of our data to reduce the risk of an intrusion or interruption and we monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats   however these measures and efforts may not prevent interruptions or breakdowns and we may otherwise fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively furthermore we may fail to anticipate plan for or manage significant disruptions to our systems if any of the foregoing were to occur our competitive position could be harmed we could lose existing customers have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers specialist physicians and other healthcare professionals have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data breach or theft of intellectual property or suffer other adverse consequences any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows          risks related to our regulatory environment    we are subject to various federal state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations and a finding of failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business    our operations are and will continue to be directly and indirectly affected by various federal state and foreign healthcare laws including but not limited to those described below   § federal antikickback statute  us code §ab which prohibits any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving any remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in return for or to induce the referring ordering leasing purchasing or arranging for or recommending the referring ordering purchasing or leasing of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs   § federal “sunshine”  us code §ah law which requires us to track and report annually to cms information related to certain payments and other “transfers of value” provided to physicians defined to include doctors dentists optometrists podiatrists and chiropractors and teaching hospitals and to report annually to cms ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members we are also subject to similar foreign “sunshine” laws or codes of conduct which vary country by country   § federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit among other things persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to or the knowing use of false records or statements to obtain payment from or approval by the federal government suits filed under the false claims act known as “qui tam” actions can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals commonly known as “whistleblowers” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement when an entity is determined to have violated the false claims act  us code § it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus civil penalties for each separate false claim   § federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa statute which among other things created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services   additionally hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of  and applicable implementing regulations impose certain requirements relating to the privacy security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization on entities subject to the law such as health plans clearinghouses and healthcare providers and their business associates internationally substantially every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we must comply including the data protection directive ec and national implementation of the directive in the member states of the european union   many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws such as antikickback and false claims laws which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including commercial insurers as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with healthcare professionals and entities and require us to track and report payments and other transfers of value including consulting fees provided to healthcare professionals and entities some states mandate implementation of compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws additionally certain states require a certificate of need prior to the installation of a radiation device such as the srt we are also subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws which vary by country          if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future we may be subject to penalties including administrative civil and criminal penalties damages fines disgorgement individual imprisonment contractual damages reputational harm exclusion from governmental healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results   our products are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new or improved products   our products must comply with regulatory requirements imposed by the us food and drug administration the us department of health and human services and other governmental agencies in the us and similar agencies in foreign jurisdictions these requirements involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures sampling activities an extensive agency review process and other costly and timeconsuming procedures it often takes several years to satisfy these requirements depending on the complexity and novelty of the product if we execute on our plans to move our manufacturing function inhouse we will also be subject to additional licensing and regulatory requirements relating to safe working conditions manufacturing practices environmental protection fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potential hazardous substances some of the most important requirements applicable or potentially applicable to us include   § us food and drug administration regulations title  cfr parts     and  § eu ce marking of conformity requirements depicted within the mdd directive eec § health canada requirements sor § medical device quality management system requirements iso  § occupational safety and health administration requirements § china cfda requirements and § other similar quality regulatory and statutory requirements in foreign jurisdictions in which we currently market or plan to market our products in the future   additionally due to the nature of our products as radiation producing medical devices we are also subject to certain state laws and regulations related to the sale of our products although we have taken steps to ensure our compliance with such state laws and regulations our failure to fully comply with these requirements could result in fines or penalties and could also adversely affect our ability to sell our products   government regulation may impede our ability to the manufacture our existing and future products government regulation also could delay the marketing of new products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on activities the us food and drug administration and other regulatory agencies may not clear or approve any future products on a timely basis if at all any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain these approvals could negatively impact the marketing of any future products and reduce our product revenues regulatory bodies may review products once they are on the market and determine that they do not satisfy applicable regulatory requirements failure to comply with requisite requirements may lead to european economic area regulatory bodies ordering the suspension or withdrawal of products from the european economic area market or as discussed below notified bodies withdrawing certificates of conformity for devices or the underlying quality systems   further regulations may change and any additional regulation could limit or restrict our ability to use any of our technologies which could harm our business we could also be subject to new international federal state or local regulations that could affect our research and development programs and harm our business in unforeseen ways   product deficiencies could result in field actions recalls substantial costs or writedowns these could lead to the delay or termination of ongoing trials if any and harm our reputation business or financial results   our products are subject to various regulatory guidelines and involve complex technologies the us food and drug administration and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could affect patient safety manufacturers may under their own initiative conduct a product notification or recall to inform physicians of changes to instructions for use or if a deficiency in a device is found or suspected          identified quality problems such as failure of critical components or the failure of third parties to supply us with sufficient conforming quantities of these products or components could impact the availability of our products in the marketplace or lead to adverse clinical events in addition product improvements or product redundancies could result in scrapping or expensive rework of products and our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer as a result product complaints quality issues and necessary corrective and preventative actions could result in communications to customers or patients field actions require the scrapping rework recall or replacement of products result in substantial costs or writeoffs or harm our business reputation and financial results further these events could adversely affect our relationships with our customers or affect our reputation which could materially adversely affect our earnings results and financial viability   a future field action or recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers negatively affect our sales and subject us to us food and drug administration or similar governmental authority enforcement actions moreover depending on the corrective action we take to redress a product’s deficiencies or defects the us food and drug administration or similar governmental authority may require or we may decide that we will need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the product before we market or distribute the corrected product seeking these approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled products in a timely manner if we do not adequately address problems associated with our products we may face additional regulatory enforcement action including us food and drug administration or similar governmental authority warning letters product seizures injunctions administrative penalties or civil or criminal fines   any identified quality issue can both harm our business reputation and result in substantial costs and writeoffs which in either case could materially harm our business and financial results   the offlabel use or misuse of our products may harm our image in the marketplace result in injuries that lead to costly product liability suits or result in costly investigations and regulatory agency sanctions under certain circumstances   the products we currently market in the us have been cleared by the us food and drug administration for specific indications our clinical support staff and marketing and sales force have been trained not to promote our products for uses outside of the cleared indications for use known as “offlabel uses” however if a physician uses our products outside the scope of the cleared indications there may be increased risk of injury to patients furthermore the use of our products for indications other than those cleared by the us food and drug administration may not effectively treat the conditions associated with the offlabel use which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients adversely affecting our operations   if the us food and drug administration determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an offlabel or other improper use it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions including the issuance of an untitled letter a warning letter injunction seizure civil fine or criminal penalties it is also possible that other federal state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an offlabel use which could result in significant penalties including but not limited to criminal civil or administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations   the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to european economic area member states governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices in addition voluntary european union and national codes of conduct provide guidelines on the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals these regulations or codes may limit our ability to affectively market our products or we could run afoul of the requirements imposed by these regulations causing reputational harm imposing potentially substantial costs and adversely affecting our operations as a result          we are required to comply with medical device reporting requirements and must report certain malfunctions deaths and serious injuries associated with our products which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions   under the us food and drug administration medical device reporting regulations  cfr  medical device manufacturers are required to submit information to the us food and drug administration when they receive a report or become aware that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has or may have a malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur all manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the european economic area are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell meddev  to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred through the european vigilance process   if an event subject to medical device reporting requirements occurs we will need to comply with the reporting requirements which would adversely affect our reputation and subject us to actions by regulatory authorities such as ordering recalls imposing fines or seizing the affected products furthermore any corrective action whether voluntary or involuntary will require the dedication of time and capital and will distract management from operating our business any of the foregoing would further harm our reputation and financial results   healthcare policy changesmay have a material adverse effect on our business   the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act included among other things a deductible  excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the us with limited exceptions effective january   this excise tax imposes a significant increase in the tax burden on the medical device industry and if our efforts to offset the excise tax are unsuccessful the increased tax burden could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows however this excise tax has recently been suspended for  and  the tax remains uncertain for future years other elements of this act including comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions may significantly affect the payment for and the availability of healthcare services and may result in fundamental changes to federal healthcare reimbursement programs any of which may materially affect numerous aspects of our business   other healthcare reform measures may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the reimbursement received for procedures utilizing our products in addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the act discussed above was enacted that may adversely affect our revenues these changes include aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to  per year effective april  which due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will stay in effect through  unless additional congressional action is taken additionally in  president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which among other things reduced medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years these new laws may result in additional reductions in medicare and other healthcare funding which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial operations any reduction in reimbursement from medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors the implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to increase revenue attain profitability or commercialize our devices in addition other legislative changes may be enacted or existing regulations guidance or interpretations may be changed each of which may adversely affect our operations   in addition the requirements or restrictions imposed on us or our products may change either as a result of administratively adopted policies or regulations or as a result of the enactment of new laws moreover there have been recent public announcements by members of the us congress president trump and his administration regarding their plans to repeal and replace the affordable care act medicare and medicaid although we cannot predict the ultimate content or timing of any healthcare reform legislation potential changes resulting from any amendment repeal or replacement of these programs including any reduction in the future availability of healthcare insurance benefits could adversely affect our business and future results of operations          risks related to our intellectual property   if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products we may lose market share to competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably   our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products we rely on the patent protection of two us patents which we have acquired as well as a combination of copyright trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology we also have patent applications currently pending and in the process of being submitted however these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage for example some or all of our pending patent applications or any future pending applications may be unsuccessful the us patent and trademark office may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications or future patent applications and patents issued as a result of these patent applications if any may not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous to us we could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the us patent and trademark office these proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in our issued patents third parties may successfully challenge our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future which would render these patents invalidated or unenforceable and which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing and selling related products in addition our pending patent applications include claims to aspects of products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents and third parties may successfully patent those aspects before us or otherwise challenge our rights to these aspects   both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are comparable to our products although we have entered into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with certain of our employees consultants and advisors in order to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary technology these agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements in addition we have not sought patent protection in all countries where we sell our products if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country or major market we may be precluded from doing so at a later date competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further may export otherwise infringing products to territories in which we have patent protection that may not be sufficient to terminate infringing activities furthermore the laws of some foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if at all   in the event a competitor infringes upon one of our patents or other intellectual property rights enforcing those patents and rights may be difficult and time consuming even if successful litigation to defend our patents against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management’s attention from managing our business moreover we may not have sufficient resources to defend our patents against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights any of which would adversely affect our ability to compete and our business operations as a result   if our trademarks or trade names are not adequately protected then we may be unable to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected   our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged infringed circumvented or declared generic or determined to infringe other marks we may be unable to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in markets of interest if our trademarks are challenged infringed upon circumvented or declared generic or infringing or if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names then we may be unable to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected   the medical device industry is characterized by extensive patent litigation and if we become subject to litigation it could be costly result in the diversion of management’s attention require us to pay significant damages or royalty payments or prevent us from marketing and selling our existing or future products   the medical device industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights determining whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues the determination of which is often uncertain our competitors may assert that their products the components of those products the methods of using those products or the methods we employ in processing those products are covered by us or foreign patents held by them in addition they may claim that their patents have priority over us because their patents were issued first because patent applications can take many years to issue our products that currently do not infringe on existing issued patents may later infringe on patents that are pending now or in the future our products might also inadvertently infringe on currently issued patents as the number of participants in the market for skin cancer and general oncology devices and treatments increases the possibility of patent infringement claims against us increases any infringement claims litigation or other proceedings would place a significant strain on our financial resources divert the attention of management from the core business and harm our reputation          a larger more established company could allege that we infringed its patent and that we owe royalty payments on sales of certain products as a result any claim against us even without merit may cause us to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain on our financial resources divert the attention of management from the core business and harm our reputation if the appropriate authority upholds the company’s patent as valid and enforceable and finds that we infringed on the patent we could be required to pay substantial damages including treble or triple damages and royalties if an infringement is found to be willful and we could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement a license may not be available on reasonable terms if at all and we may be unable to redesign products in a way that would not infringe those patents if we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products either of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following   § stop selling making or using products that use the disputed intellectual property § obtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling making licensing or using products which license may require substantial royalty payments and may not be available on reasonable terms or at all § incur significant legal expenses § pay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing § pay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing or § redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property which could be costly disruptive or infeasible   any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   we may indemnify our customers and international distributors with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against customers or distributors these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers or distributors regardless of the merits of these claims if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of customers or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use each which would adversely affect our operations if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms customers may be forced to stop using our products which would materially and adversely affect our business   we may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we our employees or independent distributors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of competitors or are in breach of noncompetition or nonsolicitation agreements with our competitors   many of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies including our competitors or potential competitors many of our independent distributors sell or in the past have sold products of competitors we may be subject to claims that we our employees or independent distributors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the trade secrets or other proprietary information of our competitors in addition we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee or independent distributor to break the terms of his or her noncompetition agreement or nonsolicitation agreement litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims even if we are successful in defending against these claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management if we fail in defending these claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel a loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize products which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations          adverse outcomes in litigation or similar proceedings could adversely impact our business   we currently are and may in the future be named as a party to litigation or other similar legal proceedings adverse outcomes in any or all of these proceedings could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to continue conducting our business while our management does not believe any of the proceedings currently pending against us are material to our business such matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future if an unfavorable final outcome in any such matter becomes probable and reasonably estimable our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected   risks related to the ownership of our securities   limited trading activity for shares of our common stock and warrants may contribute to price volatility   while our common stock and warrants are listed and traded on the nasdaq capital market there has been limited trading activity in our securities the average daily trading volume of our common stock since the shares began trading on july   through december   was approximately  shares due to the limited trading activity of our securities relativity small trades may have a significant impact on the price of our securities   with two exceptions we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you must rely on price appreciation of our common stock for a return on your investment in the foreseeable future    except for a required tax distribution in  in the aggregate amount of  and a onetime payment in the aggregate amount of approximately  million paid to former holders of our units with a preferred return in  we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock we currently expect to retain our funds and future earnings to support the operation growth and development of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future as a result a return on your investment in the near future will occur only if our share price appreciates our securities prices may not appreciate in value or maintain the prices at which you purchased our securities and in either case you may not realize a return on investment or could lose all or part of your investment in our securities   furthermore any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to compliance with applicable laws and covenants under any future credit facilities which may restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends for example our current revolving line of credit restricts our ability to pay dividends or make any distributions or payments or redeem retire or purchase any capital stock without the prior written consent of the lender provided that we may pay dividends solely in common stock also the form frequency and amount of dividends will depend upon our future operations and earnings capital requirements and surplus general financial condition contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant we may not pay dividends as a result of any of the foregoing and in these cases you will need to rely on price appreciation of our common stock for a return on your investment   the price of our securities may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment    stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our securities in addition limited trading volume of our securities may contribute to its future volatility price declines in our securities could result from general market and economic conditions some of which are beyond our control and a variety of other factors including any of the risk factors described in this annual report on form k these broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our securities regardless of our operating performance and could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our securities since you might be unable to sell your securities at or above the price you paid factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our securities include the following          § price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time § volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of medical device company stocks § changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other medical device companies generally or those in our industry in particular § sales of our securities by us or our stockholders § failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors § the financial projections we may provide to the public any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections § rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry § actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations § actual or anticipated developments in our business our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally § litigation involving us our industry or both or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors § developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights § announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors § new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business § changes in accounting standards policies guidelines interpretations or principles § any significant change in our management and § general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets   in addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies this litigation if instituted against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources   we are both an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company” and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors    we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to   § being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” disclosure   § not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under section  of the sarbanesoxley act   § not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements   § reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and          § exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved   we will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of  december    the last day of the year in which a we have total annual gross revenue of at least  billion or b in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer which means the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the prior june  th  and  the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior threeyear period investors may find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile   under the jumpstart our business startups act emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies   we are a “smaller reporting company” meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than  million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter thus even if we are no longer an emerging growth company as a smaller reporting company we could take advantage of certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as a result investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of our internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase in addition as a smaller reporting company we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our sec filings including among other things providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures consequently it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold  shares   our executive officers directors and principal stockholders may exert control over us and may exercise influence over matters subject to stockholder approval    our executive officers and directors together with their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately  of our outstanding common stock as of december   accordingly these stockholders if they act together may exercise substantial influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of corporate transactions such as a merger this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control over us which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock   if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business the price of our securities and trading volume could decline    the trading market for our securities will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business we may be unable to attract or sustain coverage by wellregarded securities and industry analysts if either none or only a limited number of securities or industry analysts cover us or our business or if these securities or industry analysts are not widely respected within the general investment community the trading price for our securities would be materially and negatively impacted in the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage if one or more of the analysts who cover us or our business downgrade our securities or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or our business the price of our securities would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or our business or fail to publish reports on us or our business regularly demand for our securities could decrease which might cause the price of our securities and trading volume to decline          our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management    provisions of delaware law where we are incorporated our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your stock in addition these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors these provisions include   § authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders § requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect any merger or sale of all or substantially all of our stock our assets § eliminating the ability of stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders § prohibiting stockholder action by written consent § establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings § dividing our board of directors into three classes so that only one third of our directors will be up for election in any given year and § providing that our directors may be removed only by the affirmative vote of at least  of our thenoutstanding common stock and only for cause   in addition we are subject to section  of the delaware general corporation law which may have an antitakeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock   these provisions will apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders’ best interests and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock   our certificate of incorporation will provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees    our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage these lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the action in other jurisdictions which could harm our business and financial condition          if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors’ views of us or our business could be harmed resulting in a decrease in value of our common stock    as a public company we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in our internal controls in addition beginning with our annual report on form k for our year ending december   to be filed in  we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley act we are in the process of designing implementing and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation which process is timeconsuming costly and complicated in addition our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our annual report on form k following the date on which we are no longer an emerging growth company which may be up to five full years following the date of our ipo or we are no longer a smaller reporting company our compliance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act will require us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section  in a timely manner or we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by nasdaq the sec or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources   our ability to implement our business plan successfully and comply with section  requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements we expect that we will need to continue to improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems procedures and controls to manage our business effectively any delay in the implementation of or disruption in the transition to new or enhanced systems procedures or controls may cause our operations to suffer and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our auditors when required under section  of the sarbanesoxley act moreover we may not implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future even if we were to conclude and when required our auditors were to concur that our internal control over financial reporting provided reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because of our inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements or omissions   item b unresolved staff comments

offering we paid a cash dividend of approximately  million to former holders of our limited liability company units with a preferred return we anticipate that for the foreseeable future all earnings will be retained for use in our business and no cash dividends will be paid to stockholders any payment of cash dividends in the future on the company’s common stock will be dependent upon our financial condition results of operations current and anticipated cash requirements plans for expansion as well as other factors that the board of directors deems relevant additionally certain contractual agreements and provisions of delaware law impose restrictions on our ability to pay dividends for example our current revolving line of credit restricts our ability to pay dividends or make any distributions or payments or redeem retire or purchase any capital stock without the prior written consent of the lender provided that we may pay dividends solely in common stock additionally section a of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” only permits dividends to be declared out of two legally available sources  out of surplus or  if there is no surplus out of net profits for the year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding year socalled “nimble dividends” however dividends may not be declared out of net profits if “the capital of the corporation computed in accordance with sections  and  of the dgcl shall have been diminished by depreciation in the value of its property or by losses or otherwise to an amount less than the aggregate amount of the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets contractual obligations and applicable law will restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends in the future   use of proceeds from the sale of registered securities   in june  we completed an initial public offering or ipo of units consisting of one share of common stock and one

reportable segment which is consistent with how our management reviews our business prioritizes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance   revenue   our sales primarily relate to sales of our devices we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured we do not provide a right of return related to product sales revenues for service contracts are recognized over the service contract period on a straightline basis revenue for rentals of equipment is recognized over the lease term on a straightline basis          we sell products and services under multipleelement arrangements with separate units of accounting in these situations total consideration is allocated to the identified units of accounting based on their relative selling prices and revenue is then recognized for each unit based on its specific characteristics a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis the principal deliverables in our multiple deliverable arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting consist of i sales of medical devices and accessories and ii service contracts performance obligations including installation and customer training are considered inconsequential and are combined with the product as one unit of accounting selling prices are established using vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if vsoe does not exist we use our best estimate of the selling prices for the deliverables   we operate in a highly regulatory environment and are continually entering into new markets in which state or foreign approval is sometimes required prior to the customer being able to use the product in these cases where regulatory approval is pending revenue is deferred until such time regulatory approval is obtained and customer acceptance becomes certain   deferred revenue consists of payments from customers for separately priced service contracts sales pending regulatory approval and deposits on products   we provide warranties generally one year in conjunction with the sale of our product these warranties are short term in nature and entitle the customer to repair replacement or modification of a defective product subject to the terms of the respective warranty we record an estimate of future warranty claims at the time we recognize revenue from the sale of the product based upon management’s estimate of the future claims rate   shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are included in cost of sales   cost of sales   since  we have used a third party manufacturer for the production and manufacture of our main products the srt product line in accordance with our product specifications cost of sales consists primarily of direct material direct labor overhead depreciation and amortization a significant portion of our cost of sales consists of costs paid to our third party manufacturer   gross profit   we calculate gross profit as net revenue less cost of sales our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including average selling price manufacturing costs production volumes product reliability and the implementation over time of costreduction strategies our gross profit may fluctuate from quarter to quarter    selling and marketing   we focus on two primary markets  private dermatology practices and radiation oncologists in both private and hospital settings we currently employ a multitier sales strategy in an attempt to optimize geographic coverage and focus on what we perceive to be our key markets this multitier sales model uses a direct salesforce and international dealers and distributors we expect the amount of our sales and marketing expense to increase as we continue to expand our sales force and marketing activities   general and administrative   general and administrative expense or ga consists primarily of salaries employee benefits bonuses and related costs for personnel who support our general operations such as executive management finance accounting and administrative functions as well

credit facility with silicon valley bank our interest expense will fluctuate in future periods to the extent we incur additional or pay down indebtedness   income taxes   until december   the company was a limited liability corporation llc that had elected to be taxed as a passthrough entity and accordingly we did not recognize a federal or state income tax provision beginning in  as a result of the conversion from an llc to a delaware corporation income tax benefit expense consists of income taxes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business we are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction in which we operate or generate revenue the composite income tax rate tax provisions deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved   inflation   inflation has not had a material impact on net sales revenues or income from continuing operations for our two most recent years as a result of historically low levels of inflation   significant trends and uncertainties impacting our business   many third party payors follow coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by

we may invest in short and intermediateterm interestbearing obligations investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us government the medical device industry is highly competitive subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other participants our currently marketed products and any future products we commercialize will compete against healthcare providers who use traditional surgical treatment options such as mohs surgery as well as medical device companies that offer other treatment options for the conditions our products are designed to treat we currently have three primary medical device company competitors • xstrahl medical formerly gulmay headquartered in the united kingdom • xoft a subsidiary of icad headquartered in new hampshire • elekta headquartered in georgia xstrahl medical is an engineering company focused on industrial and research xray therapy devices we believe most of xstrahl medical’s installed base is comprised of legacy orthovoltage machines made up of higher energy devices located in europe both xoft and elekta offer products that are considered electronic brachytherapy “ebx” devices due to this classification both companies may face challenges in the us and certain other international markets where laws and regulations require that a radiation oncologist medical physicist or radiation therapist be involved with every treatment additionally the cpt® editorial panel has established two new treatment delivery codes for ebx for  including a specific skin code in addition in early  a large medicare contractor issued guidance precluding the reporting of the existing ebx treatment delivery code for skin the  payments rates for the ebx treatment delivery skin code is currently being established by the various medicare contractors the new skin only code and payment rates may make this technology a challenge for dermatology inoffice applications based on typical treatment practices it appears that both ebx products also have limited capabilities as to size of lesions that can be treated and require expensive consumables furthermore ebx products have very limited clinical studies many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of their products our competitors may also have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do including relationships with our potential customers in addition many of these companies and healthcare providers have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we do because of the size of the skin cancer treatment market and the high growth profile of the segments in which we compete we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products additionally we may also face competition from smaller companies that have developed or are developing similar technologies for our addressable markets we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include • improved outcomes for medical conditions • acceptance by doctors treating nonmelanoma skin cancer and keloids • potential greater acceptance by the patient community • potential greater ease of use and reliability • product price and qualification for reimbursement • technical leadership and superiority • effective marketing and distribution and • speed to market we may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors in regard to any one or all of these factors our ability to compete effectively will depend on the acceptance of our products by dermatologists radiation oncologists hospitals and patients and our ability to achieve better clinical outcomes than products developed by our existing or future competitors in addition certain of our competitors could use their superior financial resources to develop products that have features or clinical outcomes similar or superior to our products which would harm our ability to successfully compete company description we are a medical device company headquartered in boca raton florida specializing in the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancers and other skin conditions such as keloids with superficial radiation therapy superficial radiation therapy is based on a technology with decades of successful clinical use treating various benign and malignant skin conditions prior to the introduction of mohs surgery and linear accelerators in the late s and early s the predecessor of superficial radiation therapy orthovoltage was the standard of care in treating several skin conditions including skin cancer when mohs surgery was developed and linear accelerators or linacs were introduced to treat cancer the manufacturers of the orthovoltage devices abandoned manufacturing these products believing that mohs surgery and linear accelerators would ultimately become the standard of care in treating skin cancer we believe that orthovoltage device manufacturers may have perceived these newer procedures and technology as being superior to orthovoltage for a number of reasons including i the fact that mohs surgery did not require significant capital investment other than specialized medical training ii that higherpowered linacs offered the ability to treat a wider variety of conditions because of its deeper xray penetration and iii the perceived impracticalities of orthovoltage machines due to their large size as a result the orthovoltage technology became largely dormant recently healthcare providers are recognizing the benefits of superficial radiation therapy and there is a resurgence of this technology based on a retrospective analysis published in the journal of the american academy of dermatology in  recurrence rates for all tumors at two and five years were  and  respectively for cases of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma treated with superficial radiation therapy matching the recurrence rates for mohs surgery we believe this study illustrates the effectiveness of superficial radiation therapy in the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer superficial radiation therapy is also an effective treatment modality for keloids which are firm rubbery lesions or shiny fibrous nodules that can vary from pink to the color of the patient’s flesh or red to dark brown in color in conjunction with surgical removal one recent study has indicated that surgical excision combined with platelet rich plasma and postoperative inoffice superficial radiation therapy can achieve a nonrecurrence rate of  at the fourth to eleventh month followup no other treatment modality known to us leads to a greater nonrecurrence rate we believe that modern superficial radiation therapy technology has improved over its orthovoltage predecessor with modern technology such as that found in the srt an equipment system manufactured by us there is very low radiation scatter which is significantly below the threshold defined by the american association of physicists in medicine and the conference of radiation control program directors inc our technologies preserve healthy tissue while attacking only the cancer cells because unlike linacs the srt uses low energy photon xrays which are only capable of penetrating skin up to approximately five millimeters further while orthovoltage devices were very large requiring a dedicated room the srt is a mobile unit with a  x  footprint additionally with a shift in the demographics of skin cancer patients due to an aging population we believe superficial radiation therapy offers certain benefits that may not have been relevant decades ago when skin cancer patients were generally younger for example patients with certain health conditions or who have been prescribed certain medications may not be good candidates for surgical procedures such as mohs surgery due to the additional health risks these procedures present although mohs surgery a procedure involving the progressive removal of microscopic layers of cancercontaining skin until all cancer cells are removed is one of the leading methods to treat nonmelanoma skin cancer there are significant downsides to this procedure for example patients often experience pain following the procedure in addition to the inconvenience and pain involved with undergoing mohs surgery there are several other potential unpleasant aspects that may affect the surgical area such as temporary or permanent numbness temporary or permanent weakness itching enlarged scarring and other postsurgical complications superficial radiation therapy treatments typically take less than one minute per treatment and therapy requires multiple visits often patients undergoing superficial radiation therapy treatment will need three to four treatments per week for up to four consecutive weeks to achieve the desired results additionally superficial radiation therapy is typically limited to the treatment of surfacebased skin cancers because of the limited penetrating ability of the radiation used therefore while safe and effective for many skin cancers superficial radiation therapy typically is ineffective in treating skin cancer in advanced stages we believe that our products provide patients with a safe and virtually painfree alternative to surgery for treating nonmelanoma skin cancers including basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma and other skin conditions including keloids our products also allow dermatologists to retain nonmelanoma skin cancer patients rather than referring them to other specialists while offering radiation oncologists an alternative to costly linear acceleratorbased treatments with a process that is less invasive more timeefficient and which improves practice economics we offer the srt product family which we anticipate will be complemented by additional models and options in the future with over  installations in  countries we believe our srt product family to be a global leader in the superficial radiation therapy space we own two patents in the us us patent nos  and  related to the srt system and a third patent application pending in the us china and russia we have also submitted two provisional patent applications and are in the process of preparing several other provisional patent applications we have received k marketing clearance from the us food and drug administration or fda european ce marking certification cfda the chinese equivalent of the fda and health canada approval we also received regulatory clearance for russia in the fourth quarter of  these governmental clearances and approvals are required to market and sell medical devices to customers located in the countries or areas covered by these agencies we are currently marketing our srt in both the us and abroad to private dermatology practices and private and hospitalbased radiation oncology practices we have been active in bringing this system to the global marketplace since the fourth quarter of  and have a growing distribution network to sell the srt to healthcare providers in the us and internationally  sensus healthcare llc a delaware limited liability company was formed on may   to design
