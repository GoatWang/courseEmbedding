with jim clemmer chief executive officer and michael greiner chief financial officer of angiodynamics with that i’ll turn the call over to jim who will offer insights in to the quarter jim jim clemmer thanks evan good morning everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call results for the quarter continued to demonstrate the execution on our disciplined approach to strengthen our company this focus has had a positive impact on both our gross margin and our gross profit delivering strong eps growth and cash flow generation our improved operational efficiency and strengthened balance sheet will provide a strong foundation as we move forward on the initiatives that are setting the company up for growth for fiscal  and beyond during the third quarter revenue growth was below our expectations some of the reasons with the result of actions that we took to improve the underlying performance of our business some of those include continuing our sku rationalization program that now has eliminated more than  skus this fiscal year we’ve also made changes in our personnel here in the us and internationally to better support our growing business moving forward and we’re also doing things differently as a management team when it comes to our operations internally the portfolio management decisions and our strategic decision making for our long term growth we understand that revenue is the biggest driver of long term shareholder value and we are confident the measures that we’re taking will improve our topline growth as we move into  we will layout these plans for growth when we host our investor day next thursday in new york as part of our effort to simplify and strengthen our supply chain we are closing our manufacturing facilities in denmead uk and in manchester georgia and will move those operations in to our new york manufacturing facility this consolidation is expected to be complete by the end of  calendar year and will result in reduced costs optimized inventory management and gross margin improvement we anticipate an  month payback period for this project in line with our focus on highvalue products that improve outcomes for both patients and caregivers we recently announced that we received ce mark certification or the solero microwave tissue ablation system we are proud to introduce solero product overseas and with an initial european launch starting april we’re looking forward to launching the product here in the united states following our fda approval solero story is a key example of why our rd process needs to be reset solero offers valuable benefits to both patients and physicians and it competes in a market where we already have a solid position our new rd process has allowed us align our people quickly identify what needed to be done and execute against our plan to get solero to the finish line this new rd process is just one of several initiatives currently being undertaken that are focused on strengthening the foundation to build a great growth company that can consistently deliver the growth and profitability our investors are looking for i’ve talked about three goals grow our revenue improve our profitability and generate strong amounts of free cash flow we are currently delivering on the second two and i hope you trust our commitment to be a growth company i look forward to providing you with more details of our three year plan to grow our company during our investor day next week with that i’ll pass the call to michael michael greiner thanks jim and good morning everyone from a topline perspective as you saw total revenue for the quarter was  million down  yearoveryear gross margin for the third quarter was  that’s up a  basis points yearoveryear this improvement was primarily the result of net productivity which contributed  basis points of expansion offset by some pricing pressure and product mix as a result of our gross margin improvement and despite the shortfall in revenue gross profit did grow yearoveryear by almost  net income for the third quarter was  million or  per share compared to net income of  or  per share in the same quarter last year adjusted net income was  million compared to adjusted net income of  million from last year adjusted eps was  during the third quarter up approximately  from  in the same quarter last year and adjusted ebitda was also up  yearoveryear to  million once again we had strong cash flow performance during the quarter we generated  million in operating cash flow and  million in free cash flow as a result of our strong working capital management effort specifically to focus on cash collections as well as lower capex during the quarter additionally we ended the quarter with  million in cash and investments and currently have outstanding debt of  million we also retired all of our treasury shares outstanding during the quarter as we discussed during our second quarter call we executed against our plan to pay off the outstanding balance on our revolver during the third quarter and currently have no revolver debt outstanding that leaves our net debttoebitda ratio when calculated utilizing our full cash balance at  as of the end of the third quarter our continued commitment to prudent financial management supports and strengthens our balance sheet which will provide greater flexibility for our long term growth potential i’ll now provide an over view of the third quarter results for each franchise our peripheral vascular franchise delivered  million in revenue down  compared to last year yearoveryear declines in fluid management and venous were slightly offset by volume in the core business we had approximately  million in revenue related to cook during the quarter as the business starts to normalize we will continue to focus on further strengthening these customer relationships in order to maintain as much of this revenue as possible in vascular access revenue was  million down  yearoveryear va experienced decline across the portfolio partially offset by strong bioflo sales particularly in midlines while nonbioflow products were down  during the quarter bioflo sales increased  compared to the prior year the oncology surgery business generated  million in revenue that’s up  yearoveryear primarily due to higher utilization across each of the product lines and internationally revenue was  million up  yearoveryear now turning to guidance given some of the revenue challenges jim described earlier we believe that it is prudent to lower our revenue guidance for the year to be in the range of  million to  million however as a result of our continued focus on operational improvements we are increasing our adjusted eps guidance to be in the range of  to  although our current free cash flow yeartodate is just below  million we are not increasing our free cash flow guidance at this time this is because we anticipate and inventory build of approximately  million to  million in the fourth quarter to support the closure of our denmead uk and manchester georgia facilities with that i will turn the call back over to jim for closing remarks jim clemmer thanks michael to summarize we are focusing on improving the performance of our company through research and development managerial discipline commercial execution and operational excellence when fully functioning we will grow our company overtime part of that effort has included adding senior level management to lead our organization i’m pleased to share with you that bob simpson joins our leadership team as our senior vice president and general manager of our peripheral vascular business bob is wellrespected results driven medical device executive who joins us from medtronic based upon my experience working with bob for several years he’s known for leading teams with a disciplined strategic intent and focusing on accountability and execution key factors to angiodynamics’ over all long term growth we look forward to sharing our long term growth plans with you during our investor day next week we plan on outlining details on how we will achieve topline revenue growth in the coming years additionally we plan to break down strategies by each franchise highlighting the unique growth drivers and the plans we have to capture greater market opportunities thanks for joining us this morning and now we will open the floor for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and we’ll take our first question from matthew mishan with keybanc matthew mishan first on the guidance if i’m doing the math right i think it implies a material step down in profitability sequentially from q to q and i’m just trying to understand the driver does that or are you simply being conservative jim clemmer well there’s a couple of things there as we look in to the fourth quarter that we’re looking to do we’ve been behind a little bit on spend and in rd through the year because we’ve been a little more thoughtful of some of our projects as we mentioned that the new program that’s in place we’ve also been a little bit behind on spend and some others areas in selling and marketing with headcount so we anticipate that we’ll have small increase in expenses as we enter the fourth quarter but revenue will sequentially be up quarteroverquarter going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter matthew mishan and then on the consolidation of the facilities could you give us a sense of what the cash restructuring costs are and then the expected annualized savings from the consolidation of those facilities jim clemmer so as jim mentioned the payback period will be about  months we anticipate that we’ll get savings in the range of  million initially that’s primarily related to the overhead that will be avoided going forward and as we bring that manufacturing all in to one location in upstate new york we think there’s additional savings down the road we haven’t built those in to the calculation yet though and the cost will range somewhere between  million and  million to shuttle those two facilities matthew mishan and let me squeeze me one more in the free cash flow has been a really great story for you guys this year how should we be thinking about that moving forward maybe but how are you looking at it like a free cash flow conversion metric maybe to adjust the net income and then what’s the reasonable rate of capex for this business michael greiner so next week we’ll layout good detail on those two questions but at a high level here we’ve done a lot of work around payables receivables inventory management this year although as in the fourth quarter we’ll have inventory building but that’s obviously a temporary build in order to supply inventory for these plant closures but as we go in to next year we still anticipate having free cash flow growth opportunity but as we exit next year we’ll be more maintenance mode from a working capital standpoint and then it’s a matter of driving more profit to get more free cash flow and just from a capex standpoint this has been a slightly lighter year than we are building in to our models for the next couple of years but the increase in capex is not significant to have a material impact on free cash flow operator and we go next to bryan brokmeier with cantor fitzgerald bryan brokmeier so you made some personnel changes you commented about in the prepared remarks and also in prior quarters as well as changes i believe a couple of quarters ago to better incentivize the sales force for the long term pipeline growth have you begun to see improvements in the pipeline and can you provide a little bit of color around where you’re seeing the biggest improvement so far michael greiner sure bryan so our pipeline specifically talking about the new product pipeline that we are developing bryan brokmeier i’m talking about the sales pipeline michael greiner so two things so sales pipeline at this point we have changed a couple of spots in our senior leadership team as you know there’s two new general managers here bob has just joined us less than two months ago so we haven’t seen a big difference there in the sales pipeline in those businesses we are making we are aligned properly and we have the right resources where our customers expect us to be so there’s now a big change in our sales pipeline there’s bigger change in the rd pipeline the sales pipeline is similar to what it has been and we are preparing now with our sales strategies to be where we need to be to support our new product launches that we’ve identified in the coming years bryan brokmeier have you met with the fda to discuss the data that’s currently available on the neomycin and what more they may require for submission michael greiner bryan good question at this point we talk to the folks that are on the call about our intent to work with the fda to try to expand the indication that we currently have so next week we’ll give a bit more detail around there but to answer the question yes we’ve been working on the background here at ango and having conversations to prepare ourselves to have a good argument why we think we deserve an expanded indication in this space bryan brokmeier and then lastly are you seeing much in terms of you commented on the cook revenues in the quarter but are you seeing much in terms of crossselling as a result of those new sales of the angiographic catheters michael greiner i would like to see a bit more i think if you look back at the  month history of the cook recall the first few months and a couple of other companies i think we are doing all we could from a backward looking supply chain standpoint and forwardlooking commercial standpoint just to help the customers have product in the shelves to treat patients so it was very very much scrambled when we talked to you about that setting up our supply chain and now we are in the phase where people are staying with us we don’t know yet cook is not said a lot about if and when they’ll return so we’re now in a maintenance mode where we’re trying to do all we can to support these customers long term and to maintain that with our products so ultimately we think there will be more opportunities for crossselling but the truth is a lot of these folks already were our customers at a certain point whether it was a couple of the products in that category or in sister categories so we have a pretty broad touch in to the area that use these products so we will continue now our space is a bit bigger and we’re a larger supply of partner to some of these hospitals we think that will open up parallel selling opportunities but to this point it’s been a lot of maintenance and working with these customers to make sure they’re satisfied operator now we’ll move to matt taylor with barclays ian mahmud this is ian mahmud in for matt can you hear me okay just stepping back a little bit it sounds like currently there’s a tradeoff between new operational efforts and driving revenue growth can you just comment generally on how far long you think you are in terms of ultimately delivering on revenue growth and specifically on the sku rationalization can you remind us how many you’ve eliminated so far and how many you are targeting jim clemmer so to be clear we’re not trying to say we’re going to do one and not the other so early on in my tenure here at ango i think i identified the folks that i thought there was a lot of room we needed to do when i was going to spend time looking internally and improving our operations and strengthening the foundation of our company for growth some of those things i talked about included changing the compensation plan to ensure it’s aligned with our corporate goals changing how we do our operations where we do our operations the announcement this morning of closure of two of our four facilities was important for us to streamline our supply chain and then i talked about the sku reduction program we have too many skus that we offer today for a company our size yet we care deeply about the customers that use our products so it’s a very purposeful profit to change skus out yeartodate we’ve had i believe our number is  yeartodate skus we’ve reduced when you do that we did allude to this we put revenue at risk some customers may not be pleased that we’re changing an sku of a product they used buy they may choose a different product from a different company we’re fully prepared for that risk so those are some things we’ve done and we’ve been purposeful about them and i think we’ve communicated those properly over the course of the year but just to be clear we’re not trying to say we can only do those and not for revenue we expect to grow our revenue in line with continued operational excellence and internal management changes to make our company operate streamlined in the future we’ll give you more details next week of how we’ll grow revenue going forward that will include both product and commercial activities michael greiner and just to answer your second question we don’t specifically have a sku target we’re looking across our entire portfolio that’s profitable what can we make in large volume and so it’s an ongoing project that we’ll continue to look at so there’s no target that we currently have in mind ian mahmud as a followup can you discuss your philosophy for balancing some of your internal growth goals versus external revenue opportunities jim clemmer we monitor the markets we’re in we know the spaces we’re in we know them pretty well and we know how they’re growing or the challenges they face to grow and we match up our internal capabilities where we stand in line with those places so what we’re doing now is making the choices to either realign or add resources to the areas that interest us the most as far as growth opportunities so what we do is a constant analysis inaudible portfolio management process challenging our own portfolio and then it’s also resource allocation process to make sure we have the necessary tools to compete in the space that we want to win it so next week we’ll give you folks more detail around the spaces that we’ve chosen and will share with your some of the resources that we’re going to add in those areas and then what our expected growth will be in the coming years operator and we’ll go to jason mills with canaccord genuity cecilia furlong hi this is actually cecilia furlong on for jason and i just wanted to ask first on rd it was a little lighter than we had modeled for the quarter and just if you could give any color about where you see this going over the next few quarters jim clemmer that’s correct it’s probably been a tad lighter in the second and third quarter the big reason for that is we’ve taken a step back in our rd process and we’ve analyzed where do we expect to win where can we win and the places we want to participate strategically and so we’ve put on pause some spending until we identify those places we can win so for instance we took a fair amount of resources and we redirected them towards solero to make sure we can this solero ce mark over the finish line which we have we’re doing that in other pockets as well as talked about earlier with inaudible we do anticipate that spend in rd will increase in the fourth quarter but when you talk about this in the past the overall rd dollars that we’ve been spending as a company  to  of revenue we anticipate we’ll stay in that range we don’t think that we need to spend more than that we just believe that we needed to identify better areas of how to spend that and be more focused on how to spend that in a way that aligns with our strategy so the total dollars should remain fairly consistent over our future which will show next week in that  to  but we believe that these are better dollar spend that are more focused in places where we can win cecilia furlong and then just turning to gross margins what’s your expectations around the impact of the consolidated manufacturing facilities and overall where you see gross margin trending over the next year or two jim clemmer so specific to the manufacturing impacts as we said it will be about an  month payoff so the first  month is a kind of a breakeven analysis obviously but we anticipate there to be around  million plus in annual savings subsequent to that so that impact will be over to your  basis points subsequent to that we are also anticipating other things that we’re doing in our operations and those will contribute significantly more than that so next week when we talk about our ranges for a variety of margin metrics including gross margins you will see and we’ve talked about this in prior calls that we believe we can get to  plus in gross margins over time through this action as well as additional actions down the road operator and we’ll go next to jayson bedford with raymond james hearing no response we’ll move to lucas baranowski with craighallum capital lucas baranowski this is lucas baranowski on for charles haff taking a look at your revenue for the quarter oncology revenue came in about  million better than we expected and you mentioned that it was driven by higher utilization can you tell us whether that higher utilization was more weighted towards nanoknife or maybe more weighted towards the ablation products jim clemmer it was across as we noted in our prepared remarks it was across all of our oncology products lucas baranowski and then on your income statement the acquisition restructuring and other items i think was a bit smaller than it has been for quite a while do you expect that to tick back up in the coming quarters or is it going to be  kind of remain around current levels michael greiner that’s tough to answer right now because that is a bucket that captures often onetime unusual items that we’re not anticipating specific to the fourth quarter legal expenses which we include in there specific to unusual litigation was down versus budget and versus our prior year so that was a component of it we didn’t have amounts in there related to ma costs that was also down so that’s a inaudible monitor going forward as exactly how that plays out again that tends to be a line item that we try to capture unusual items of things that are not consistent with our normal daytoday operations and you’ll see next week as we lay out some of the metrics that we believe are good indicators of our execution against our threeyear plan this is an item that we want to see shrink over time because obviously we want to not have those types of onetime on unusual items so those are obviously hard to forecast operator and we’ll go next to dominick leali with raymond james dominick leali this is dominick in for jason i just had a few questions here and i wanted to make sure in japan this quarter did you guys receive the stocking order for around  million jim clemmer we did yes that was a part of the  international growth that we saw dominick leali and on skus was there revenue impact in this quarter and is that by itself sort of source of revenue growth going forward jim clemmer i’ll take your second half first when we do skus normally you’re not going to grow revenue from there so try to minimize the impact of reducing those skus so in this quarter primarily there’s probably a little bit of revenue loss i don’t think it’s large enough so we can identify but it’s a disruptive event when you’re talking to customers about a product that they had chosen to use and telling them that you’re not going supply any longer we can offer them alternatives and they also know alternative may exist from other companies out there so we fully understand it’s a disruptive event yet we think the benefits outweigh the risks for our company going forward dominick leali and there’s a couple more bioflo as a percent of access is there a percentage you can help us with michael greiner bioflo a percentage of access let me check it’s a little under  dominick leali and within access can you help us understand the growth of the segment do any of those segments go michael greiner well midline continues to show a significant growth opportunity and that’s all bioflo in midline and then the other piccs continues to see some headwinds there without our chip location although bioflo piccs continues to hold in okay and then ports and dialysis was down a little bit on the quarter so we anticipate a fourth quarter where you have a little more even performance across ports and dialysis we’ll probably continuously see some headwind at least in our bioflo piccs and that should continue to show us some strong growth dominick leali and for midline to overall are we still thinking about  million for this year michael greiner yes midline’s for the year yes sorry dominick leali and just last are there any related thoughts on duplication going forward as you explore options jim clemmer so as we mentioned to the folks last summer we can discontinue the celerity program that was in our pipeline for research and development and going forward we’ve also mentioned that we are interested in having a chip locater in that space if we could i can tell you it’s not our biggest level of interest right now so we’ll speak more about it next week you’ll get to talk to chad oneonone next week he’ll will give you more detail but it’s not something we’re concerned with at this moment operator and we’ve got a followup question from matthew mishan with keybanc matthew mishan i just wanted to followup on the decline in revenue guidance as you came in to the year i think you were conservative in your expectations around the cook recall so you would have had some level of cushion on the revenue guidance there what specifically is coming in worse than you thought coming from the beginning of the year jim clemmer matt a couple of things it was a tricky balance to get the cook revenue add with the base business and our people in the field they are selling their marketing team in their pv group has done a really good job servicing those customers through this dramatic time and taking care of them and actually bringing this new cook business in and maintaining it they’ve done a great job on the other sides we’ve been softer than we thought in our venous business and our fluid management business has been a bit softer than we thought that’s offset some of that we knew coming in to the year the vascular access business would be challenged as we just mentioned with some of the items there on piccs and then third internationally we thought our international growth would be ahead of where it’s at today we’ve looked at some of the reasons why and matt some of that maybe as you know when i joined the company last spring and michael joined in the end of the summer we know a lot more now than we knew then able to understand our company better and our trading partners better and our business processes better so we just feel right now we’re giving you guys a really good indication of what we truly believe to be on the most after reflection of where we sit today next week we’ll give you a lot more detail and reasons behind the actions next week to give you why we believe we can be a growth company in a very short near future michael greiner the other thing we’ll be very focused on and jim was alluding to this just now matt but we’re going to be focused on trying to determine what’s the right demand pull for our product portfolio and so that takes some time to work through for certain product lines that might have been a little more of a push approach versus related to demand so we’re working through some of those things and hopefully exiting ’ where we’re going to have a much better sense of normalization quartertoquarter for revenue matthew mishan and on the venous or the evlt side why do you think that’s been a little bit weaker than you thought jim clemmer well two things you got to remember there’s a comparable issue as well last year we changed towards inaudible so i think the company went through a lot of energy last spring last winter and last spring to prepare for that and second we’ve just been a little lighter than expected there some of that we’ve internally looked at trying to figure out if its execution on our side and we also know that our customers some of the demand for account source has been maybe slightly more unstable than the past we have a great history of understanding our customers’ demand and we know we’re all a major players in that space but we’ve seen a bit of instability there not enough that we’re going to highlight it with you earlier but it’s an area as you know we’re highly focused on and again next week we’ll give you more details on our future so i think again these are small choppy pieces these are normal choppy things that happen in an annual cycle of any company so we’re not really here to highlight any of these in particular operator it does appear we have no further questions at this time i’d like to now turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks jim clemmer thank you again operator on behalf of angiodynamics thank you again for calling this morning we hope you have a good level of input to our company and we think we’ve also shown that we can do what we said we’re going to do we told you we’d drive more profitability from our revenue and we extract more free cash from our profitability we’ve shown the foundation of a very strong operating company the largest challenge that we face going forward is to show we can grow revenue consistently at compelling revenue growth rates we know that’s our challenge we accept that challenge and we look forward with the opportunity to share our plans with each of you next week in

like to turn the conference over to jim polson please go ahead sir jim polson good morning and thank you for joining our conference call as we provide an update on angiodynamics’ business as well as review financial results for  fiscal fourth quarter and full year which ended on may   the news release detailing the fourth quarter and full year results crossed the wire earlier this morning and is available on the company’s website a replay of this call will also be archived on the company’s website during the course of this conference call the company will make projections or forwardlooking statements regarding future events including statements about revenues earnings and free cash flow for the fiscal year  we encourage you to review the company’s past and future filings with the sec including without limitation the company’s forms q and k which identify specific factors that may cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forwardlooking statements a slide package offering insights for the company’s financial results is available on the company’s website under presentations this presentation will support remarks made by company executives and should be read in conjunction with the press release discussing the company’s operating results and financial performance released prior to this morning’s call this morning we’re joined by jim clemmer chief executive officer and michael greiner chief financial officer of angiodynamics with that i’ll turn the call over to jim who will offer his insights on the quarter jim clemmer thanks jim good morning everyone we’re pleased to be with you today to provide an update on our business review the strategic progress that we’ve made over the course of fiscal year  and discuss how we intend to build upon that momentum going forward we’ll also discuss our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the full year ended may   at the beginning of the year we anticipated that it was going to be a time of transition for angiodynamics we introduced several initiatives designed to improve operations become more efficient and ultimately drive longterm value creation i want to look back at the three goals we’ve spoken about over the past  months growing revenue improving profitability and generating strong amounts of free cash flow for profitability we delivered a record  in adjusted eps up  yearoveryear in addition our margins improved over last year as a result of net productivity improvements that’s despite a significant operational consolidation and a product recall and withdrawal for free cash flow we finish the year at a record high  million up  from last year as a result of our efforts to improve our operations and for revenue we reported  million in sales down  from last year and just outside of the bottomend of the revised guidance of  million to  million that we issued last quarter but as you can see affecting that revenue was a  million reserve related to a recall and a voluntary market withdrawal of our acculis microwave tissue ablation system had that not occurred our revenue would have come in at  million within the guidance that we provided we continue to strengthen the foundation of our business and are becoming the stronger operating company that we’ve spoken about for the past year we are profitable and able to generate significant amounts of cash to invest in our business that drives sustainable growth going forward we had a really good year even with a significant amount of transition we worked hard and we made progress against our strategy and you can trust that we will become a growth company with that i’d like to turn the call over to michael for a review of our financial results and an overview of our expectations for fiscal  michael greiner thanks jim good morning everyone before i begin i would like to draw your attention to the slides which we provided for today’s call we hope this type of information is helpful as we walk through various onetime significant or unusual items that occurred during a given quarter and fiscal year we also are highlighting our core financial drivers in these slides we anticipate sharing similar materials with you in the future quarters i’ll start with our fourth quarter results and then discuss our full year performance in a minute sales during the fourth quarter were down yearoveryear as a result of declines in each of our three businesses the overall decrease in vascular access was partially offset by growth in bioflo related products particularly with our midline family oncologysurgery was down primarily due to the  million reserve related to the recall of market withdrawal that jim mentioned with our acculis microwave tissue ablation system the reserve for acculis also had a significant impact on our international sales versus our prior year results our commitment to institutionalizing financial and operational improvements allowed us to drive yearoveryear increases in adjusted ebitda gross margin and cash flow our gross margin of  includes the impact of our acculis recall and market withdrawal excluding the total impact of the acculis reserves which include both an inventory reserve and a reserve on revenue our gross margin would have been  now i would like to elaborate on the acculis recall and market withdrawal and what we are doing there as well as other onetime events which impacted our fourth quarter results at the conclusion of the quarter we went through acculis from the market this was prompted by a voluntary recall at acculis probes leaving us with two options to go forward rather than fixing and replacing these probes we decided to issue a voluntary market withdrawal of the acculis systems to account for the recall and market withdrawal we recorded a  million revenue reserve related to probes that we anticipate being returned from our customers separately we have a  million reserve related to inventory both for probes which will be returned from customers as well as probes and generators we had on hand at the end of the year as you can see on slide five of the presentation this had an overall negative impact on our earnings of  million however as we look to maintain our microwave business we are migrating our top acculis customers over to solero during evaluation and replacement program which we expect to be completed by the end of the first quarter we believe that having more solero units in the field sooner than previously anticipated will help drive greater probe usage than we have initially expected for fiscal year  second in the quarter we received a  million medical device tax refund for past payments made we recorded a receivable at the end of the year and we’ve already collected the refund ph and interest in early june finally we are working through resolving the previously disclosed legal matters with the doj related to our legacy lc bead products as well as a separate matter for our venacure evlt products we are cooperating fully with these investigations and had constructive conversations with the doj towards resolving these matters we have reviewed a range of outcomes and concluded that it is now appropriate to report an accrual of  million for potential resolutions representing a low end of the tight range of probable outcomes now shifting to our full year results sales were down slightly compared to fiscal year  due to declines in vascular access and oncology partially offset by growth in our peripheral vascular business pv sales were driven by growth in the core angiographic catheter business offset by declines across most of the rest of the portfolio declines across the va portfolio were partially offset by significant growth in midlines and as it relates to oncology sales reflect declines in both microwave and nanoknife products which was offset by growth in our radiofrequency ablation products we’re up yearoveryear in each of our core metrics including as jim mentioned a record adjusted eps of  that is a  yearoveryear and free cash flow which is up  to  million as you will see on slide five of the accompanying presentation there were several significant items that occurred during the fiscal year which are worth noting and we’ve already mentioned several of them in talking about the fourth quarter these include the acculis recall and market withdrawal we discussed earlier the medical device tax refund i just mentioned various assets and liability writeoffs related to decisions we made during the second quarter as part of our ongoing strategic portfolio management process if you recall from our second quarter earnings these writeoffs resulted in a  million benefit mostly related to the reversible of contingent liability payments we no longer expect to pay our operational consolidation continues which will result in a closure of two of our manufacturing facilities finally the reserve related to previously disclosed legal matters of  million even with the noise that these items created during the year we are pleased with our full year ability to drive profitability and generate cash our cash position of  million plus our existing revolver give us access to nearly  million of capital as we end our fiscal year  this will provide us flexibility in fiscal year  and beyond to support our strategic capital allocation priorities among those investing rd analyzing ma opportunities and buying back shares at opportune prices and now i’d like to take this opportunity to confirm the guidance we set forth at our investor day in april we expect revenues for fy  to be in the range of  million to  million full year adjusted eps to be in the range of  to  and just as a reminder this includes the investments in rd clinical and sales and marketing that we outlined in our investor day in april and finally we expect to generate more than  million in free cash flow this excludes the potential resolutions related to previously disclosed legal matters before i hand the call back to jim i’d like to take a moment to discuss the k that we issued after the close of markets expected day as we may have seen we filed an k yesterday to describe a material weakness related to specific aspects of our annual goodwill impairment process for our fiscal year  the material weakness was specific to the controls around the goodwill impairment process and a documentation of that annual process to be clear this control weakness does not have any impact to the prior conclusion related to any impairment of goodwill no impairment of goodwill although we will be filing an amended k for the  fiscal year as well as amended qs for the  fiscal year there will be no changes or impacts to our financial statements or other disclosures included in these filings these amended filings will be made to pull our internal control opinions solely arising at  fiscal year annual goodwill impairment review process as noted in the k we believe the material weakness has already been remediated and we anticipate filing a clean management internal control opinion when we file our  annual report on form k in the coming weeks i look forward to fielding any questions to clarify this during the qa with that i’ll turn the call back over to jim for some closing comments jim clemmer thanks michael before we open to questions i’d like to take a moment and look back on the past year when i joined the angiodynamics i realized that our company had high quality products and we operated in strong markets but we were simply stretched too thin we’ve done several things to simplify our business over the past  months which have strengthened our foundation and positioned us for growth first at our investor day in april we showed a new approach to portfolio management which segments our product categories into those in which we will either invest or maintain based upon growth potential going forward our invest portfolio will be made up of our key growth drivers nanoknife in our oncology business bioflo in vascular access and venous insufficiency and thrombus management in our peripheral vascular business we believe these areas provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace and offer longterm growth opportunities second we recently made the decision to reorganize our global structure into global business units previously we had a senior executive who oversaw most of our international sales and marketing while the franchise general managers had oversight in the us moving forward as gbus our general managers will be able to implement a truly global approach to their business they can capitalize on significant international opportunities and make the necessary tradeoffs to ensure that we are accountable to our shareholders to drive growth third we announced the consolidation of our operations from four facilities to two this initiative will allow us to be more nimble as we look to grow in the future and will improve our margin profile as we continue to gain cost efficiencies this is a project that is on track and will be completed during our third quarter of fiscal  and fourth we have made significant changes to our culture throughout the year we have flattened our organization to allow leadership to be closer to our markets and our customers we’ve welcomed new members to our team across the organization including some new senior executives who are running our businesses and we revised our compensation structure to better align every employee with our company’s plans for growth finally we have an overall clear strategy for capital allocation and began to support that strategy during fy  by institutionalizing spending discipline across the organization refinancing our debt to make capital more available and buying back  million of our common stock we will continue to deploy this strategy as we move into next year these larger initiatives were complemented by activities that are significant in the way we run our business including an sku rationalization initiative that has eliminated more than  skus our new rd process and continuous efforts to remove costs in our supply chain in addition to these efforts to simplify our business we are prioritizing initiatives that we believe will support revenue generation over the past  months we have accelerated our nanoknife strategy with reimbursement and regulatory bodies in the past quarter those efforts have resulted in nice showing their support towards a reimbursement pathway through additional clinical data ongoing discussions with the fda regarding an indication to include pancreas and positive discussions with cms on reimbursement in addition during the fourth quarter we announced a lawsuit alleging that one of our competitors in the vascular access space cr bard has illegally tied the sale of its tip location systems to its line of piccs violating federal antitrust laws preventing competition in the marketplace and limiting patient access to our superior technology this lawsuit is designed to create a more competitive marketplace that allows caregivers to choose the best product for their patients as you can see we were deliberate in our decisionmaking to move the company forward and to better support our customers employees and shareholders we at angiodynamics play a vital role as partners in the delivery of healthcare and we love our role we have worked hard to gain traction in our markets and credibility with our investors we have delivered on two of our three financial goals and we understand the need to grow revenues at a faster pace we intend to do so by improving our performance launching new products at a pace much faster than our historic average and by utilizing our financial strength to acquire external assets of strategic and financial value we are confident in the strength of our business moving forward and the financial guidance that we have set forth none of this could happen without the strength and the commitment of our employees we are fortunate to have a talented and dedicated team we will continue to foster a culture that will allow them to thrive and increase the overall performance of our company now i’d like to take this opportunity to thank everyone on the call for your continued support of angiodynamics with that jennifer we’ll turn the call over for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you sir operator instructions our first question will come from matthew mishan with keybanc matthew mishan good morning and thank you for taking the questions jim clemmer good morning matt matthew mishan hey jim could you first contrast for us maybe some of the differences between solero and acculis and then what  as far as the installed base of acculis what sales especially on the probes and the recurring revenue are at risk of losing as you do this recall and then in the past when you had a recall it has taken a lot of your sales force time to deal with the customers and move the customers from one product to another and it’s cost you sales in other areas should we expect some weakness in the remainder of oncology sales as a result of this over the next couple of quarters jim clemmer okay good questions matt a bunch of stuff let me try to jump in and tackle that for you and michael may chime in as well first of all with acculis the product itself was i would say endoflifecycle the product was scheduled to be replaced as you know with our solero product now unfortunately the solero product is late to market as identified with all of you on the phone the need was here very apparently to me when i arrived last year to redo our rd process put more rigor and milestones in it if i believe we had the process then that we have now solero would have been launched on time we could have done a smooth and seamless transition out of acculis into solero unfortunately that didn’t occur so here’s kind of the strange part acculis was  we were losing faith with our customers in acculis was not performing the way it should so we had some softness in that business you see our numbers it was okay not dynamic but that’s an area that should be growing so we are very pleased with how solero has been received initially in the marketplace it uses the base technology of our microwave system that acculis had which has proven to be highly effective what solero does differently because we used physicians help design it our gui the graphic user interface has changed completely much more physician friendly and it offers more opportunities for them to treat patients in a better manner so matt we’re trying to do a simple transition from one system to another there’s always turbulence when we do that we have built into our  expectations some of that turbulence that occurs because that our sales people are focused right now and taking care of those customers and making sure that our customers can provide the product to do the cases necessary for the patients in need we feel good about what we are now of course we would have rather had this problem be avoided but here it is i can tell you today the way angio is dealing with it we’re probably little more prepared than we have in the past the sales and marketing team did a really good job our operations team globally doing a really good job because we’ve decided to make much more of the hardware available for our customers and initially in our supply chain projections they weren’t that deep but we’ve responded to make sure we can get to the market as fast as we can so it’s a lot of stuff matt but i hope we have answered some of your questions michael greiner jim i’ll just add to that the  million reserve matt for revenue our whole right is that we would be able to turn all of that into revenue in  so it’s basically just moving revenue that we would have recorded in  and going into  i think we recognize that there’re some customers that may walk away from the products so we won’t get all of that  but we also believe by replacing the generators quicker than what previously anticipated and having a manufacturing buildout that we’re doing that we will have more usage and therefore more probe sales so we have a bunch of puts and takes throughout the year i think one thing to point to is we did not come off of our investor day revenue guidance and if you got into the math which you will we ended with  but our guidance was  to  so we basically are taking out  and we’re moving it into our baseline for  so now that provides you a little comfort of the puts and takes we definitely had some headwinds and you identified some of them we also feel like there are some tailwinds that will continue to put us in the range that we anticipated being in back in april matthew mishan and switching over to the nice recommendation congratulations on the progress that you’re making there what exactly does that do for you did it remove the investigational or experimental label does it help with private payers does it help you maybe in some of the other european countries how does that progress with nice really translate to real world sales jim clemmer yes it’s a fair question matt hey matt we’re joined here today by stephen trowbridge our general counsel and the head of our clinical affairs group i rather have steve answer that for you give you more detail stephen trowbridge thanks jim hi matt thanks for the question you can think of the nice progress that we made as the next positive step towards getting full coverage decision in the uk what they’ve done is they’ve removed it from pure experimental we’ve taken the next incremental step to allow us to continue to gain clinical evidence but then to your point exactly go to the private payers in the uk and they got the green light to give a positive decision provided that we can have positive discussions with them we do expect that that will have a positive impact throughout the rest of europe as we continue to gather this evidence and prove out this technology so i think a lot of the items that you raised are exactly the ones that we see as positives coming out of this we are able to go to private payers in the uk we’re able to negotiate payment for them provided that we’re continuing to gather evidence through registry and we do expect that to then have a halo effect as we move out into discussions with other european countries operator and next we will hear from matt taylor with barclays matt taylor i wanted to followup on your commentary about nanoknife in the us you said you had some positive discussions with cms could you touch a little bit more for us you said in may that you really get some color on exactly what the pathway could be to get additional indications i was just curious what that might look like jim clemmer go ahead steve stephen trowbridge sure so there are two paths that we’re going down in the us one is the indication pathway with the fda and then the second path is regarding reimbursement with cms although those two items are linked they are two separate paths so we’re continuing to have discussions with the fda we feel that there is enough evidence out there to support expanding in the current indication to include pancreas in one form or another we’re going to continue those discussions we’ve had the separate path conversations with cms and we’re continuing to go down that path of moving towards some coverage decisions through cms and that may take a variety of forms we’re still working through our conversations to determine that exactly what form we’re going to take but there has been positive discussion in a sense that they’ve acknowledged that there is a very large base of evidence that’s out there now in the published literature that supports the use of this technology so we look we’re going to be looking to leverage that clinical data that’s out there to continue to move the ball with the conversations with cms it may take a variety of forms but there have positive indications that the level of evidence out there does support the technology and that’s what we’re going to continue to talk about matt taylor okay thanks and i wanted to have a followup question on guidance if i could and i don’t know how much specificity you can give but i guess i was just curious if you think about the different divisions could you help us understand what the differential outlook is for them for fiscal  and how much has changed since may i mean it sounds like with the issues in microwave maybe that growth will be a little lower but any other color you can provide directionally or if you can give us kind of a numeric range that would be helpful michael greiner yes so we don’t specifically matt talk about revenue dollars associated with our business units when it comes to our guidance obviously from an actual standpoint in our qs we do i think when we look at oncology as an example given the acculis withdrawal we will see some mix in there we also  the back half of the year is dependent on nanoknife particularly to the discussions around panc that steve just referenced and then what our rf device could be doing possibly in japan although we’re looking at that market and what we want to do there so there is a mix of things on oncology and then when you look at pv and access we expect midlines continue to drive growth there along our access business and then on a pv business we do have the comparison points on core for angiography catheters so we had in the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter of this year  last year we had fair amount of inventory channel for the product once cook had their recall and then we’ve gone to a more normalized run rate we expect to maintain most of that business as we go forward the more normalized run rate and so there’s a mix of things but ultimately we believe that each of the bus in addition to what we can see internationally will provide a little bit of incremental growth in each of our pockets and obviously the pancreatic outcomes will be determined in the back half of the year operator and we will now hear from jason mills with cannacord genuity jason mills hi jim and mike good morning can you hear me okay jim clemmer yes good morning jason jason mills good morning great i want to follow up on matt’s question just with respect to business unit segmentation i’m guessing with the  confidence that you build that up to give your guidance and i’m wondering jim on a go forward basis do you plan on organizing your business and your revenue rational to the street around these three business units or not and i’m curious because it seems to me like it would make a lot of sense to give us your thought process around revenue expectations for these three businesses on a go forward basis and talk to them with respect to your growth expectations as opposed to us modeling them and then but not giving any color on them i guess i mean it is a bit of constructive criticism but also just curious as to how you think about building up your revenue profile revenue expectations on a go forward basis jim clemmer yes it’s a fair question jason when you go back to the april guidance that we gave at our investor day if we look at we basically have  product categories here within our three divisions and in the april meeting and even today we reaffirmed the four that we’re going to invest more of our business in that we expect growth from and in april we showed that the other six categories our threeyear cagr we’re expecting is around flat and the other four that we’re going to invest in will have a much higher cagr so we’ll focus jason definitely more of our conversations around how and why we expect those four to outperform due to investments and market dynamics but your question’s good maybe we’ll spend a little more time going through each of the three divisions during the course of this year and have a little more specificity around the growth in each one i can tell you this year in the va franchise obviously we trust and believe what bioflo does and we see repeatedly feedback from the marketplace why it’s so strong so i think the focus is really better execution and performance back to buy the data supporting the product use so we’re going to get  they should be positive this year and growing that’s a turnaround for the va business the pv business again those two areas we identified will grow and even the fluid management business which is our largest single category that we’re not expecting high growth over the years it’s being run really well and taking out almost  skus from that business has actually allowed them to streamline things and be more reactive to our customers and i wouldn’t be surprised if they outperformed our expectations with that business and finally on oncology jason the bulk of our growth over the coming three years we identified in april will come from oncology and we believe that as messy as it is right now with the microwave transition from acculis to solero at some point we’ll have at least gotten solero units into the hands of customers at a faster pace and allow them to test our technology against competitors we think will stack up really well there and as you’ve seen now with three different prongs to the stool on our regulatory process to get nano reimbursement or indication expansion it’s going down the path we expected so we’ll expect that business to outperform the others from a revenue perspective and when it does the margin profile adds to a healthy mix as well jason mills okay that’s helpful and going back to your point about your four key products for future investment bioflo venacure angiovac back and nanoknife will you give us performance specific numeric performance results and guidance on a go forward basis and either all four of those areas or that group as a combined entity jim clemmer it’s a good point we haven’t thought about that jason but maybe we should let’s take a look and think about it jason mills okay jim clemmer give you guys more clarity there we don’t call out guidance by categories but we’ll help to give clarity on those areas jason mills jim the only reason i mentioned is that at the analyst meeting i think you did give an expectation for growth from that cumulative group of products and so as we think about your performance related to that guidance or sort of loose guidance that you gave at the analyst day that would be helpful i’m sensitive to the fact that i asked too many questions so let me just get to a couple of other ones and get off and let some others jump in but as we move down to pl you gave a good amount of guidance on   through  basis at your analyst meeting so i’m just wondering as we think about building up specific to your bottom line guidance in  what we’ll see in terms of gross margins in  and then i know that you expect  to be an investment years especially on the rd side if you could give us a range as well in the middle of the pl in terms of  maybe as a percentage of sales basis what you expect sga and pro forma specifically on sga and rd to look like maybe in terms of a ranges for those gross margins rd and sga and so far as you would be willing to give us some additional guidance michael greiner yes so on the gross margin we still anticipate gross margins to be  plus we do indiscernible with the solero transition just the way the accounting is going to work as we get the units out but we think there are other things that we’re seeing some tailwinds on so we’re sitting that  plus gross margins rd gross dollars are going to be up significantly from this year but we will always be in that kind of  to  range as a percentage of revenue and it’s a little over  for next fiscal year or this fiscal year that we’re currently in  and then sga is going to be around  jason mills and those are pro forma guidance for angios right mike michael greiner they are i just want to make sure i am understanding the pro forma portion of that that’s allin for everything that we’re including we’re not excluding anything there operator and we’ll now hear from charles haff with craighallum charles haff couple quick ones here on the cook angiographic catheter impact in the fourth quarter was there much impact there jim clemmer we it was about  million related to the cook impact in q so as we saw kind of the initial supply chain builds stabilize and we’re at about clear run rate charles haff and then on venous insufficiency can you tell us what the revenue was this quarter and what’s the current plan right now for angiovac and evlt where do those two product categories stand right now commercially jim clemmer so angiovac again these are split so angiovac and thrombus management category multiple speakers but commercially again i think we identified charles back in april we really love what angiovac does we continue to see tremendous results from our physician partners use it in severe cases and situations and then on the other side we have our unifuse product at the lower end less levels of acuity again the gap we see is in between those two products and that’s where we have ongoing rd efforts to fill that gap in between so again we like our two products in that spectrum we’ve identified a gap that’s why we’re so bullish on this category because we think we can give more tools to physicians and in a very near future to grow this business michael charles haff is it fair to say that angiovac revenues were about  million in the quarter michael greiner it was north of that charles charles haff great michael greiner both angiovac and venous insufficiency were about flat versus prior year charles haff and then lastly on the elimination of the  skus i think that’s mostly in pv kits just wanted to get your confirmation on that jim and then what sort of revenue range would you kind of bracket those  skus that were eliminated either in fiscal  revenues or some of their base year just to give us a sense for what the headwind was this year and going into next year jim clemmer charles i wouldn’t focus on what the headwind is around those skus because we broke that into our  modeling in many cases the revenues were small and that’s why they were products that we looked at and discontinued in many of these cases too you are dead right they were our custom products in our fluid management group what it enabled our sales reps to do was have conversations with our clinicians and move them into a different product or different kit and maybe it’s more of a standard product to be better serve our need so it’s really historic and don’t worry about the revenue again we’ve modeled it into  and it was small but it’s one of additions it’s a move we need to make to streamline our operations moving from four planes to two could not be accomplished without things like this from here charles you’d be surprised if we do more because again we want to set a foundation for growth going forward organic and maybe external and we got to make sure our foundation can support that charles haff okay i guess i lied i have one more quick one based on matt’s question he had earlier on nanoknife pancreas label expansion or cms update you talked about second half fiscal  and expecting some strength there in nanoknife is either the label expansion or the cms update built into your second half fiscal  nanoknife guidance or would that be pure upside to what you’re thinking about there michael greiner so with the pure upside we have built in some expectations but we hope that these conversations go well that we could have some upside so we did build in some but we think we do this right there could be more to that operator and we will now hear from dominic leali ph with raymond james unidentifiedanalyst hi this is dominic in for jayson thanks for taking the question sort of just a followup on that question first is the timeline what you expect to hear back from the fda and cms is that both second half of fiscal year  and to be clear is the cms decision contingent on the fda decision and then i have one followup jim clemmer we’ll let steve reply to those stephen trowbridge so the timeline that we have laid out we still think is appropriate although what i would say is a final decision from cms would not be within that same timeframe we’ll get a lot more clarity on where we’re going and a little bit more protracted process is when a final decision comes later we’re looking at fda something that we think should  is appropriate to think about before the end of the second half in fiscal  with respect to the question of are those two things inexplicitly linked the answer is no they are linked they are somewhat connected but a cms decision is not predicted upon the fda or vice versa however we think that the best way to put these things together is to follow through these parallel paths expand the indications through the fda and then continue discussions with cms but they look at very different things the fda is concerned about substantial equivalents they are concerned about taking equity ph from their clearance perspective whereas cms is much more concerned about outcomes and costs so there are two different perspectives that they have so they are somewhat connected but not inexplicitly linked unidentified analyst okay understood thanks and just one more if we back out the acculis recall gross margin was very strong for the quarter i was just wondering why it was so strong and maybe what was the impact of pricing in the quarter jim clemmer so pricing was minimal in the quarter most of that gross margin impact was due to productivity improvements so we have really strong year unfortunately it as just the noise around a variety of things it was fully obvious the consolidated results but we had a very strong year with regards to productivity improvements pricing has been throughout the year remained around  that did not change from the fourth quarter and then we’re starting to do some builds in the fourth quarter and that gross margin is inclusive of the builds that we’re doing for consolidating the two plants in georgia and uk denmead into upstate new york so we had about  million of inventory on our balance sheet related specifically to that build and yet we still were able to have the gross margin profile when you think about labor efficiencies and other things so really really strong quarter from a manufacturing standpoint operator operator instructions thank you it does appear we have no further questions at this time i will now hand it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks jim clemmer thanks jennifer and folks thanks for listening and paying attention today we feel again we accomplished a lot this year at angiodynamics the transition of myself and new executives joining new strategic initiatives we stopped a lot of things to make sure we can enable growth in the future we believe we had a really good year we could backup our words with actions and results and really great generation of free cash flow and operating profit growth really really strong we think vision into our future and we also know as you know we need to become a growth company and we are going to do that in a few different ways number one expecting higher performance from each of us here using our performance angle to be more competitive in the field and to grow our markets that we compete in today number two our product line pipeline enhanced by our new rd process we know will bear fruit for us over a threeyear process number three additional investments like the  million we called out in fy  to take our pipeline that currently exists and to bring it up so we’ll have a more robust pipeline to support growth in  and beyond and four utilizing the strength of our balance sheet our free cash generation as an offensive tool and tactic to make sure that we have an opportunities externally whether they are fields that we can use for licensing whether they’re acquisitions whether ma opportunities we are constantly looking now to align our strategic intent with financial opportunities so we will work hard rest assured we set a pace of play here that’s faster than we’ve done in the past our expectations are higher and we hope you will see our accountability levels are appropriate we’ll hold ourselves to high level of expectations we will take into account some of the comments you made today we want to continue to give you transparency into our operations and you can measure us along our path thanks again to all of our employees at angiodynamics and thanks again for participating today operator thank you that does conclude today’s call we do thank you
