barchart opinions show traders what a variety of popular trading indicators are suggesting in terms of going long or short the opinions takes up to  years worth of historical data and runs these prices through thirteen different technical indicators after each calculation the program assigns a buy sell or hold value for each study depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study for example if the price is above the moving average of the stock then this is generally considered an upward trend or a buy note a security needs to have at least  active trading days in order to generate an opinion reading calculations the short medium and long term indicators are grouped together and calculated separately for their groups the overall indicator is a composite of all  studies listed on the page a buy is assigned  point a sell is assigned  point a hold is assigned  points the indicator value is determined by adding up the totals for the different groups and dividing this sum by the number of studies in the group the indicator is expressed in terms of a percentage if the total is greater than zero then this is a buy if the total is zero then this is a hold if the total is less than zero then this is a sell to keep the results in a more logical format we factor the overall opinion by  to keep the end result in multiples of  percentage points with the exception of a  buy or sell this is why the opinion indicators will be displayed as      and  for example rather the exact percentage value opinions are updated every ten minutes

following five readings maximum strong average weak minimum maximum is the strongest this signal has been in the historical period and minimum is the weakest the signal has been in the historical period the stronger a signal strength the less volatile the signal for example a maximum buy signal is less likely to change to a hold or a sell signal than a weak buy signal a hold signal does not have any strength signal direction  buysell signal direction the signal direction is a shortterm day measurement of the current movement of the signal regardless if signal is a buy or sell the direction is an indication of whether the most recent price movement is going along with the signal the buysell direction can be one of the following five readings strongest strengthening average weakening weakest a buy signal with a strongest direction means a buy signal which is becoming stronger similarly a sell signal with a strongest direction is becoming stronger the direction goes with the signal hold signal direction the signal direction of a hold signal is a shortterm day measurement of where the signal is heading be it toward a buy signal or a sell signal the hold direction can be one of the following five readings bullish rising steady falling bearish a bullish hold signal indicates that the signal is heading toward a buy configuration and a bearish hold signal indicates
