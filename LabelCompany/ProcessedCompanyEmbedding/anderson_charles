exhibition in  years  sta honorary lifetime membership charles s anderson received the society of typographic arts honorary lifetime membership award  aiga medal charles s anderson received the american institute of graphic arts centennial year medal the highest honor for exceptional achievement in the field of design philosophy our design is based on our impressions of the world around us – pieces of culture sometimes popular sometimes obscure we turn those observations into a visual vocabulary that can be used to transform an impersonal product concept or entity into an approachable accessible image with a distinctly human quality one that is equally at home on the printed page the store shelf or the digital realm in societys relentless push for modernism it is possible to lose sight of the joy the memories the familiarity the desire when the human element is removed from the design process it can create a situation where all brands become indistinguishable  we see a different modernism in design evolving one not based on antiseptic minimalism and an absence of humanity but one that is rich in cultural vocabulary and personal expression a design philosophy and approach that first acknowledges where we came from and uses that understanding to create a new path to the future while we believe that strategy is important we find that research works best when partnered with artistic intuition and put to use in marketing comprised of good ideas and attentiongetting art our job as designers is not just to create a brand or deliver a message but to give that brand or message a tangible and inherent artistic value that connects on a visceral as well as visual level ultimately in order to communicate a design must first be noticed it should stand out and be unique compelling interesting funny strange…anything except boring predictable and just like everything else the artistic quality of the finished piece is always our priority because unlike those who focus a little too heavily on the commercial in commercial art we have no desire to be the biggest or the richest we would however like to be the best design is a matter of intuition tempered with common sense paul rand the further backward you can look the further forward you are likely to see churchill quotes steven heller of the new york times and prolific design author and historian wrote charles anderson is a formalist stylist and entrepreneur who over the past twentyfive years—one generation—has made invaluable contributions to design and has produced design that represents the highest values of art and commerce moreover he’s spawned a generation of strong designers one can see his influence on designers who wed the past and present into contemporary stylistic manifestations he has a personality and character to his work that is unique to him if we measure our aiga lifetime achievement medalists by the breadth of their shoulders i think many stand on his without breaking his back ellen lupton chief curator of the smithsonian’s cooperhewitt national design museum in new york wrote “csa images created by charles s anderson design company is fresh and witty drawing on numerous twentiethcentury commercial art styles mixed with contemporary illustration approaches” the late ikko tanaka one of japans founding modernist designers wrote anderson design has succeeded in creating a fashionable alluring and widely admired style of graphic design that is truly american the late philip b meggs professor virginia commonwealth university wrote “i am delighted that you are going to make screen designs from the csa website available for reproduction in the revised edition of a history of graphic design this will permit documentation of the more recent evolution of your work while showing the involvement in web design product design and the new form and color approaches my efforts as a design educator to document the evolution of the graphic design field have only been possible as a result of the generous help of the pathfinders who created the history thank you very much for helping with this effort” awards and honors aiga medal charles s anderson received the

representing a different movie category television is not a static medium so we created an identity that could change and evolve utilizing a different icon each time it appeared on screen when the logotype and  different icons were presented to ted turner he asked which one is the logo he was told all of them and it was explained how the series of icons were interchangeable he replied i understand but which one is it which one is the real logo all of them “but which one” categories logo  brand product design identity systems packaging testimonial as you can see from this new but
