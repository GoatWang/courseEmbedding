sports defendant united states district court nd illinois eastern division april   attorneys appearing for the case swingaway sports products inc plaintiff represented by joseph j jacobi  mcdonald hopkins llc  matthew j cavanagh  mcdonald hopkins llc escalade incorporated doing business as escalade sports defendant represented by charles j meyer  woodard emhardt moriarty mcnett  henry llp pro hac vice hillary paige krantz  freeborn  peters llp  john z lee  freeborn  peters memorandum opinion and order robert w gettleman district judge plaintiff swingaway sports products inc has sued defendant escalade inc in a four count complaint alleging patent infringement reverse palmingoff in violation of the lanham act  usc § aa violations of the illinois deceptive trade practices act and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage defendant has moved to transfer venue under  usc § a to the southern district of indiana because the action has no significant connection to the northern district of illinois defendants motion is granted facts plaintiff swingaway makes and sells a highly acclaimed innovative and patented baseball and softball hitting training system each of swingaways products bears the swingaway® trademark and all incorporate its patented features including its ball return dampening feature it was formed in  and has established itself as a leader in the baseball and softball training aids market with projected sales in  of greater than  million it is a georgia corporation with its principal place of business in marietta georgia defendant escalade is an indiana corporation with its principal place of business in evansville indiana it is in the business of making and selling sportsrelated equipment and products for a variety of sports under a number of well known brands including goalrilla it averages over  million in annual revenue plaintiff is the assignee of us patent no  the  patent entitled tethered ball practice device the  patent covers all of plaintiffs baseball and softball training aids plaintiff also owns the federally registered swingaway® trademark on june   plaintiffs president john flading was at a trade show at the college world series in omaha nebraska he was told by an industryrenowned baseball hitting instructor that a swingaway hitting and fielding aid was on display at another exhibitors defendants booth flading went to defendants booth and observed a training system identical in all material respects including the ball return dampening system covered by the  patent to a swingaway device the product was identified as a goalrilla spring trainer but was a swingaway device with minor cosmetic changes the key parts were actually physically taken from a swingaway device on further inspection flading discovered that defendant had simply rubbed off the swingaway® trademark from the exhibited device flading told the personnel at defendants booth that the goalrilla spring trainer incorporated swingaway parts and infringed the  patent defendants personnel showed flading copies of documents reflecting that the  patent had lapsed on september   for failure to pay routine maintenance fees defendant took the position that as a result of that lapse it was free to make use and sell products that read on the claims of the  patent on the basis of intervening rights under  usc § c on that same day flading contacted plaintiffs patent counsel who filed a petition with the patent and trademark office pto advising of counsels inadvertent error paying the maintenance fee and requesting immediate reinstatement of the  patent the pto reinstated the patent that same day defendant filed an action in the southern district of indiana seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement hearing nothing from plaintiff defendant assumed that plaintiff had acquiesced with respect to its position that it had intervening rights with respect to the  patent and allowed the  day service period to expire one month later almost five months after the trade show plaintiff filed the instant action in this district discussion change of venue in patent cases like other civil cases is governed by  usc § a in re ts tech usa corp  fd   fed cir  that section provides for the convenience of parties and witnesses in the interest of justice a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented  usc § a the court may transfer venue when  venue is proper in this district  venue and jurisdiction is proper in the transferee district  the transferee district is more convenient for both parties and witnesses and  transfer would serve the interests of justice spread spectrum screening llc v eastman kodak co  wl  at  nd ill  citing jaramillo v dineequity inc  fsuppd   nd ill  in the instant case only the third and fourth elements are in dispute to determine whether one venue is more convenient than another courts in this district generally evaluate five factors  the plaintiffs choice of forum  the situs of material events  the relative ease of access to sources of proof  the convenience of the parties and  the convenience of the witnesses spread spectrum  wl  at  citing amoco oil co v mobile oil corp  fsuppd   nd ill  generally the plaintiffs choice of forum is given great weight when the chosen forum is the plaintiffs home forum spread spectrum  wl  at  when the plaintiffs forum is not its home forum and the chosen forum lacks significant contacts with the cause of action the plaintiffs choice becomes merely one of several factors and is entitled to little weight id in the instant case the northern district of illinois is not plaintiffs home forum georgia not defendants home forum and has almost no connection to the cause of action it is available as a forum only because defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction here as a result of sales of its products in illinois therefore plaintiffs choice is entitled to little weight and is not a significant factor in determining whether the transferee district is more convenient the second factor the situs of material events favors transfer in patent cases the location of the infringers principal place of business is often the critical and controlling consideration because such suits often focus on the activities of the alleged infringer and its documents rather than those of the plaintiff cooper bauck corp v dolby labs inc  wl  at  nd ill june   in the instant case defendant is located in evansville indiana and all of its business decisions including the design manufacture and sales of the alleged infringing products occurred there nothing occurred in the northern district of illinois except perhaps some sales of defendants product but defendants products are sold nationwide and such sales are insufficient to establish a substantial connection to the instant forum anchor wall sys inc v rd concrete prods inc  fsuppd   nd ill  the third convenience factor ease of access to sources of proof also favors transfer as the federal circuit has noted in patent cases the bulk of the relevant evidence usually comes from the accused infringer consequently the place where the defendants documents are kept weighs in favor of transfer to that location in re genentech inc  fd   fed cir  all of defendants relevant documentary evidence is located in indiana plaintiffs evidence to the extent relevant is located in georgia nothing is in illinois therefore relative ease of access to proof favors transfer the fourth and fifth factors convenience of the parties and witnesses also favor transfer as noted all of defendants witnesses are located in indiana all of plaintiffs employee witnesses are in georgia none are in illinois plaintiff has identified a number of nonparty witnesses but none are located in this district essentially plaintiff argues that it chose chicago as a forum because it is a reasonable compromised location for litigation between the two companies because it offers more and less expensive travel options than evansville indiana making it an easier and more economical forum for all principals and witnesses including third parties this court has already rejected this argument once noting that if this were a persuasive factor the price of airline tickets would determine the most convenient venue for all litigation a result this court is hesitant to reach spread spectrum  wl  at  indeed if this court accepted plaintiffs argument this district because of its location and nearby airports would likely be inundated with lawsuits that have no significant connection to the district the only connection the instant action has to this district is that plaintiffs attorneys are located here that factor is entitled to little weight and certainly not enough to overcome the balance in favor of transfer accordingly the court concludes that the southern district of indiana is a more convenient forum than the northern district of illinois transfer must also be in the interest of justice  usc § a the likelihood of a speedy trial possibility of consolidation the courts familiarity with particular law are all factors that this court considers when evaluating whether transfer would be in the interest of justice coffey v van dorn iron works  fd   th cir  additionally the relationship of the community to the litigation and the desirability of resolving disputes in their location are other factors that determine the interest of justice spread spectrum  wl  at  plaintiff argues that this court has substantially more experience dealing with patent issues than does the southern district of indiana it reaches this conclusion by noting that between  and  this district resolved  patent cases as opposed to  by the southern district of indiana as defendant points out however the average number of patent cases handled per judge is fairly comparable and every case particularly a patent case is unique meaning the shear number of cases filed in a particular district says little about the expertise of a court to handle certain issues additionally this district has no relationship to the litigation while defendant is located in the southern district of indiana giving that district significant local interest the federal circuit has often noted that if there are significant connections between a particular venue and the events that give rise to a suit this factor should be weighed in that venues favor in re acer american corp  fd   fed cir  citing in re hoffmanla roche inc  fd   fed cir  plaintiff has brought two claims under illinois law and this courts familiarity with that law weights against transfer just as this court has on a number of occasions however had to interpret indiana law the indiana district court is fully capable of interpreting illinois law therefore the court concludes that despite the two illinois state law claims the interests of justice favors transfer conclusion for the reasons discussed above defendants motion to transfer venue to the southern district of indiana evansville division is granted footnotes  the facts are taken from plaintiffs complaint and presumed to be true for purposes of this motion  the complaint identifies escalade sports as a dba of escalade inc according to defendant the correct party is indian industries inc which does business as escalade sports escalade inc is the parent company of indian industries inc comment your name
