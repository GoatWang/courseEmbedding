closedend management investment companies whose units are registered under the securities act of  as amended the hatteras core alternatives fund is a fund of alternative investments as such the fund invests in private hedge funds and private equity investments hedge funds are speculative investments and are not suitable for all investors nor do they represent a complete investment program a hedge fund can be described generally as a private and unregistered investment pool that accepts investors’ money and employs hedging and arbitrage techniques using long and short positions leverage and derivatives and investments in many markets key risk factors the fund through an investment in the master fund will invest substantially all of its assets in underlying funds that are generally not registered as investment companies under the  act and therefore the fund will not have the benefit of various protections provided under the  act with respect to an investment in those underlying funds the fund can be highly volatile carry substantial fees and involve complex tax structures investments in the fund involves a high degree of risk including loss of entire capital the underlying funds may engage in speculative investment strategies and practices such as the use of leverage short sales and derivatives transactions which can increase the risk of investment loss the fund provides limited liquidity and units in the funds are not transferable liquidity will be provided only through repurchase offers made by the fund from time to time generally on a quarterly basis upon prior written notice the success of the fund is highly dependent on the financial and managerial expertise of its principals and key personnel of the fund’s investment manager although the investment manager for the fund expects to receive detailed information from each underlying fund on a regular basis regarding its valuation investment performance and strategy in most cases the investment manager has little or no means of independently verifying this information the underlying funds are not required to provide transparency with respect to their respective investments by investing in the underlying funds indirectly through the fund investors will be subject to a dual layer of fees both at the fund and underlying fund levels certain underlying funds will not provide final schedule ks for any fiscal year before april th of the following year those funds however will endeavor to provide estimates of taxable income or losses with respect to their investments please see the

portfolios  we believe that all investors should have access to the same sophisticated investment approach and superior portfolio management talent as the largest institutions as a boutique alternative investment firm founded in  we offer a suite of innovative products designed to help financial advisors allocate to alternative investments a message from our founder david b perkins founder and chief executive officerhow badly do you want something do you want it so badly you’ll overcome any obstacle that might keep you from your goal as a financial advisor my goal was to find a solution the question that kept me up at night was how could i put together a program that would allow my clients to invest in the same strategies and managers utilized by the largest endowments and institutions i’m an intense and passionate guy i dont like to accept the status quo without searching for something better alternatives like hedge funds and fund of hedge funds were widely available but in order to construct an efficient highly diversified institutionalquality portfolio that mirrored the university endowment model we had to find a way to add private equity to the mix everywhere i turned the reaction was the same “can’t be done” instead of listening to the naysayers we rolled up our sleeves and focused on making it happen not by doing the same old same old but by bringing a different perspective to the table we focused on finding a breach in the system  it always starts with listening to advisors having been on that side understanding the difficulties advisors had in implementing alternatives led us to simplify and streamline the process in removing barriers to entry our focus is on solutions not product for that reason i like to think that advisors who know alternatives know hatteras we are committed to helping you produce better outcomes your understanding of asset allocation and alternatives puts you in the unique position to advise clients with confidence when you partner with us you should feel like you’re our only client if you don’t you should fire us it may seem glib but it drives us our entire organization including me is here to work
