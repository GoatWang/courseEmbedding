my first lunch with john s castle a managing partner of branford castle partners “the lines are out the door” said castle who had to push his way through a crowd of people to meet me why were a group of welldressed executives queued up outside in the heat monday to buy a salad i won’t disclose which fast food chain it was castle and i tallied up the various saladrelated establishments that are seemingly gobbling up manhattan there’s just salad sweetgreen essen slow fast food and of course chop’t i confessed i’m a just salad member castle who said he has “no vested interest in salad” said it was chop’t that started the craze he wondered if the lines outside were really just a matter of getting customers out the door faster “it’s clear that chop’t created a real category here this is just an observation” he said for lunch since we were focused on it we both had chopped salads but not from chop’t we finally talked about what we were meant to discuss branford castle partners the former family office that chose in  to morph into a private equity firm castle who joined in  said the firm decided to make the switch because it “wanted more” the gp combined its own money along with family office and institutional funding to raise its first pool in october branford castle partners announced the final close of its  million debut fund “we wanted to take the next step” castle said of the

new york citybased branford castle partners purchased the majority stake in mechanicsburg pennsylvaniabased surface preparation technologies spt a provider of rumble strips and related roadway traffic safety services founded in  spt is the largest player in the space having installed more than  miles of rumble strips across  states mergermarket spoke to eric korsten managing director at branford about the deal and how increasing driver distraction is fueling a growing demand for spt’s services initial appeal spt obtained a dominant market position through a unique combination of roadway infrastructure expertise and an extensive fleet of proprietary equipment according to korsten who noted that the company designs and manufactures its highperformance patented rumble strip machines spt also benefits from infrastructurehighway spending in both good and bad times and has a strong management team that wanted to remain involved in the business branford participated in a formal auction process led by spt’s investment banker delancey street partners korsten declined to disclose the exact deal value korsten said branford performed extensive due diligence leveraging its professional relationships with accounting firm bdo as well as investor group services the latter of which performed an intensive industry study that included more than  sector participants branford recently completed a raise contributing to its appeal as an acquirer korsten noted additionally two of its last three portfolio company ceos have made overall returns of between x – x on their rollover equity investment a notable challenge in the transaction was getting branford’s lender partners comfortable with the fact that spt requires a bonding facility to support certain jobs it performs according to korsten “bonding is common in this industry and we feel it helps create an effective barrier to entry” he explained growth strategy spt intends to aggressively grow its domestic market share for existing services which includes materially increasing the size of its fleet of proprietary equipment in addition there is significant potential to expand into related new services some of which have the potential to be “game changing” with respect to selfdriving and semiautonomous vehicles the industry is highly fragmented and ideal for consolidation spt is actively considering tuckin acquisitions and where there is a particularly good fit with the company’s mandate and culture it will consider transformational buys korsten said acquisitions could be funded through any combination of cash earnouts senior or junior debt and rollover equity among other forms of consideration korsten noted branford invested in spt out of a committed fund which had a final close in october  the fund has significant capacity to support organic growth and many subsequent platform buys he added industry tailwinds in support of accelerated organic growth is a major fiveyear highwayspending bill fast act that provides for consistently increasing levels of federal highway spending korsten mentioned additionally the use of rumble strips is growing around the world as they are a proven and cost effective way to reduce highway fatalities he said recently the rate of highway fatalities has been growing rapidly due to the increasing distractions faced by most drivers rumble strips especially centerline rumble strips are an ideal way to counter those hazards according to korsten spt’s typical end customers are state departments of transportation spt either contracts directly as a general contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor advisors branford’s advisors for the spt deal included carl roston and jed freeland of law firm akerman sean windsor of accounting firm bdo and ashley shih of due diligence firm investor group services spt’s advisors were patrick dolan and david allebach of investment bank delancey street partners and linsey bozzelli of law firm blank rome abacus finance
