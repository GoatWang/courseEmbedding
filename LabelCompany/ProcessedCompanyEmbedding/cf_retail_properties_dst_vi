are outlined in rev proc  the basic 0 exchange rules involve the 0 exchange time limit 0 exchange identification like kind exchange rules and how to designate property for a 0 commercial exchange when

list 0 exchange requirements to fully defer all capital gain taxes a 0 exchanger must meet four 0 exchange requirements  0 exchange requirement the investor must reinvest a  of sale proceeds if a 0 exchanger does not reinvest all proceeds from the sale of the relinquished property the balance received is considered cash boot and the investor will have to pay capital gains taxes on that amount  0 exchange requirement the investor must acquire property with the same or greater debt if a 0 exchanger does not acquire a replacement property with an equal or greater amount of debt he or she is relieved of a debt obligation and this is called a mortgage boot the irs considers this reduction in debt a benefit to the 0 exchanger therefore it is taxable unless it is offset by adding equivalent cash to the replacement property purchase  0 exchange requirement the investor must use a “qualified 0 intermediary” also known as a “0 facilitator” or “0 accommodator” to hold the funds from the first sale until purchase of the new property is closed the “qualified 0 intermediary” qi acts as the “middleman” in the 0 exchange providing the paperwork oversight escrow services and expertise necessary to ensure that the transaction legally qualifies as a 0 exchange under section 0 of the internal revenue code even though a 0 exchange is a complicated process a 0 exchange using a good qi can become a simple transaction and look surprisingly like a standard sale  0 exchange requirement the new investment must be in “likekind” property irs 0 exchange rules require the 0 exchange of likekind relinquished property for other likekind replacement property this doesn’t mean though that 0 exchanged properties must be of the exact nature as the relinquished property bare land doesn’t have to be exchanged for bare land or income property exchanged for another income property any real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business can be exchanged in a 0 exchange for any other real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business get 0 list what is a qualified 0 intermediary a qualified intermediary is an independent agent that facilitates a 0 exchange the taxpayer’s attorney or accountant cannot be a qualified intermediary most intermediaries are affiliated with banks trust companies or title companies using a qualified intermediary is one way of “safe harboring” a 0 exchange essentially the qualified intermediary takes an assignment of rights in the sale contract for the old property and the purchase contract for the new property these are simple documents that the attorney fills out along with a basic exchange agreement with the intermediary through these three documents the intermediary is brought into the 0 exchange and subject to compliance with the timing rules discussed below the transaction can qualify as a 0 exchange rather than a taxable sale ensure your 0 exchange facilitator is fully qualified       meets the safe harbor requirements of a qualified intermediary to pass a passes a possible irs                 audit       is an independent facilitator this ensures you can work

possible replacement for the relinquished property within  days as outlined by the 0 exchange period the 0 exchange time limits and irs rules of section 0 are outlined in rev proc  the basic 0 exchange rules involve the 0 exchange time limit 0 exchange identification like kind exchange rules and how to designate property for a 0 commercial exchange when choosing a replacement property for the 0 exchange the owner must follow one of the following three 0 exchange rules  the “threeproperty” 0 exchange rule the owner may identify up to three properties regardless of their value  the “ percent” 0 exchange rule the owner may identify any number of 0 replacement properties as long as the combined fair market value fmv of those properties does not exceed  of the fmv of all sold properties  the “ percent” 0 exchange rule the owner may identify any number of 0 exchange properties no matter the aggregate fmv as long as  of the value of those identified 0 exchange properties is acquired in all cases of a 0 exchange the owner must close on the identified replacement propertys within 0 days from the sale date of the original property get 0 list 0 exchange requirements to fully defer all capital gain taxes a 0 exchanger must meet four 0 exchange requirements  0 exchange requirement the investor must reinvest a  of sale proceeds if a 0 exchanger does not reinvest all proceeds from the sale of the relinquished property the balance received is considered cash boot and the investor will have to pay capital gains taxes on that amount  0 exchange requirement the investor must acquire property with the same or greater debt if a 0 exchanger does not acquire a replacement property with an equal or greater amount of debt he or she is relieved of a debt obligation and this is called a mortgage boot the irs considers this reduction in debt a benefit to the 0 exchanger therefore it is taxable unless it is offset by adding equivalent cash to the replacement property purchase  0 exchange requirement the investor must use a “qualified 0 intermediary” also known as a “0 facilitator” or “0 accommodator” to hold the funds from the first sale until purchase of the new property is closed the “qualified 0 intermediary” qi acts as the “middleman” in the 0 exchange providing the paperwork oversight escrow services and expertise necessary to ensure that the transaction legally qualifies as a 0 exchange under section 0 of the internal revenue code even though a 0 exchange is a complicated process a 0 exchange using a good qi can become a simple transaction and look surprisingly like a standard sale  0 exchange requirement the new investment must be in “likekind” property irs 0 exchange rules require the 0 exchange of likekind relinquished property for other likekind replacement property this doesn’t mean though that 0 exchanged properties must be of the exact nature as the relinquished property bare land doesn’t have to be exchanged for bare land or income property exchanged for another income property any real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business can be exchanged in a 0 exchange for any other real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business get 0 list what is a qualified 0 intermediary a qualified intermediary is an independent agent that facilitates a 0 exchange the taxpayer’s attorney or accountant cannot be a qualified intermediary most intermediaries are affiliated with banks trust companies or title companies using a qualified intermediary is one way of “safe harboring” a 0 exchange essentially the qualified intermediary takes an assignment of rights in the sale contract for the old property and the purchase contract for the new property these are simple documents that the attorney fills out along with a basic exchange agreement with the intermediary through these three documents the intermediary is brought into the 0 exchange and subject to compliance with the timing rules discussed below the transaction can qualify as a 0 exchange rather than a taxable sale ensure your 0 exchange facilitator is fully qualified       meets the safe harbor requirements of a qualified intermediary to pass a passes a possible irs                 audit       is an independent facilitator this ensures you can work with the closing agent of your
