howe hispanic executive search search for search juan ramón alaix ceo juan ramón alaix rings the opening bell on the floor of the new york stock exchange in celebration of zoetis’s ipo “i don’t see restrictions in this country i see opportunities if you show education experience and ambition then you are well positioned for success” march   by zach baliva life in a new city is difficult especially if you root for its rival juan ramón alaix should know he moved from barcelona to madrid at age  but couldn’t bring himself to support real madrid club de fútbol when his heart was with fútbol club barcelona the two foes battle on the pitch in matches known as el clásico their rivalry has become one of the fiercest in global professional sports while soccer loyalties may seem trivial in the world of international business the lessons learned at an early age have helped alaix ceo of zoetis become one of the top hispanic ceos in the united states “moving to madrid and starting over taught me to adapt and interact in a new and different environment” he explains “that’s been an important skill to have many many times in my career” alaix graduated from university and started working in spain when a position at rhonepoulenc as the international company’s general manager took him to belgium in  he discovered relocating was easier the second time around “after you’ve lived and worked in a place that’s new to you it’s not as overwhelming to do it again” alaix says he returned to spain to serve as president of pharmacia’s operations when pfizer acquired pharmacia in  the company asked alaix to relocate to the united states and assume a regional role for his new company the move was more than a physical one as alaix found himself with a host of new professional responsibilities that he would have to master while adjusting to a new company a new culture and a new language he went from managing work in spain to managing all regional business functions for parts of europe from the united states in  pfizer decided to separate zoetis once known as pfizer animal health into an independent company the move completed in june of  after a successful ipo formed a fully independent company with  employees worldwide and products and services sold in  markets zoetis is the largest animalhealth company in the world it performs research and provides veterinary medicines vaccines and other animalrelated services zoetis generated  billion in yearly revenues in  through a threetiered model first the company interacts directly with customers developing strong relationships through the industry’s premier sales force second it continues to innovate with new products across eight species of animals and in five therapeutic areas lastly zoetis provides the most reliable highquality manufacturing supply in the industry today alaix says one of his most important functions is to guide the company through its postpfizer era by creating a new corporate dna and company culture that process begins in the corporate boardroom zoetis’s board was formed by appointing three independent members and five members from parent pfizer then when pfizer divested its remaining stake in zoetis three new board members replaced the pfizer executives one leader from pfizer stayed and other positions may still be filled alaix and other members worked together through a comprehensive interview process to find candidates from various industries and backgrounds “we wanted to locate people with expertise in business and finance as well as someone who brings science and experience in animal health” alaix says “we wanted diversity and looked for people with a good combination of experience and expertise” forming the initial board was especially important because alaix and his partners were establishing the foundation of zoetis together the board and company executives are helping zoetis find its way apart from pfizer “pfizer has their unique needs and we have ours” alaix says “we serve different species different needs and different customers a lot of what we do should be different” the company aspires for its people and products to be the most valued by animalhealth customers around the world and is establishing a strong foundation by meeting its financial commitments and working to communicate its new identity with that important work underway alaix can focus on what he does best—leading he likes to arrive at his new jersey office before the clock strikes seven the habit allows him to avoid traffic and review the previous day’s business before starting on new projects he also uses the hour to make phone calls to zoetis’s offices in europe in asia where the time difference is between  and  hours staying connected to its operations in  countries outside of the united states is important and alaix says he spends  percent of his time travelling juan ramón alaix’s formula for success you need to work hard no matter who you are or what position you hold embrace change and see every new task position or project as a chance to grow delegation is crucial in such a large organization but he likes to stay connected saying “i don’t believe in micromanaging every aspect because people should be competent and accountable but i also like to teach so that each person understands how their choices impact the full organization” alaix is a past president and current board member of the international federation for animal health ifah he serves on the executive committee to help the group promote and communicate the value that animal health companies bring to society he says ifah looks to support innovation navigate regulations and interact in public policy issues while many leaders in corporate america see major obstacles for latinos in business alaix says his global perspective and personal experiences give him a different perspective “i don’t see restrictions in this country i see opportunities” he says “if you show education experience and ambition then you are well positioned for success” zoetis for example has a csuite filled by people from various geographies including colombia like the young boy who rooted for fútbol club barcelona in the middle of madrid alaix says aspiring professionals need to be flexible while retaining who they are horizontal movement can be important for professional development adaptability is important and global experience is crucial in the “shrinking” world of international business to get to know the other ‘best of the boardroom’ leaders click here in this issue darren

the full year  and our goals for  paul will discuss some of the fourth quarter highlights the  net results and our guidance for  and  in  we affirm zoetis reputation as the global leader in the animal health industry with a strong financial performance continued investment in our future growth and a commitment to creating a value for our customers and shareholders for  our diverse portfolio enabled us to grow our revenues by  operationally with particular strength coming from rd innovations and acquired products from abbott animal health in our three years as a public company we have been delivering consistent operational revenue growth and we expect our  to show again that we are growing faster than the industry we grew our adjusted net income by  operationally and grew our adjusted ebit margin from  to  as we continue our focus on greater efficiency in our business even while we are scrutinizing our efficiency we also continue to allocate resources for future growth we invested  billion in  across strategic acquisitions internal research and development and capital expenditures in areas like manufacturing and supply and finally in  we returned approximately  million in excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this performance reflects our disciplined implementation of our business plan and our colleagues tremendous dedication to serving our customers i am pleased to say that as a result we met our guidance for revenue and exceeded our guidance for adjusted net income in  on a reported basis we had a flat revenue growth due to an  basis point impact from foreign currency but we still grew our reported adjusted net income by  thanks to our continued focus on achieving our efficiency goals looking ahead to  first and foremost we are focused on delivering our financial guidance for the year we are projecting  to  operational revenue growth which reflects the impact of our sku realization and changes to our operations in venezuela excluding those impacts we expect to grow revenues  to  operationally with  percentage points coming from the addition of pharmaq this means organic growth is expected to be faster than the market again and for  we expect to continue growing faster than market at the rate of  to  as we are confident in our end markets business model the prospects for new product launches improved product supply and progress in our efficiency goals we are also confident in our pricing strategy our prices are defined by the value that we can demonstrate to our customers who buy and pay for the products we completely independent of thirdparty payers in january we updated our adjusted eps guidance for  and  to reflect the impact of the european commission decision on our tax rate today we are pleased to reaffirm our  and  guidance for adjusted earnings per share despite the negative impact of foreign currency and the change in our operations in venezuela which will have a negative impact of  in  and  in  our second objective for  is to ensure the successful launch of new products that are critical for our longterm revenue growth we are increasing supply for apoquel and also launching in new markets this growth already surpassed  million with a limited availability in  and we see significant room to grow from this level with longterm peak sales of more than  million another important breakthrough in the area of dermatology our canine antibody therapy against atopic dermatitis has been introduced in the us to veterinarians and dermatologists and we are preparing for global market availability later in  meanwhile simparica a new oral parasiticide will help us to better compete in the global market of flea and tick products a market of approximately  billion simparica was approved in the eu later last year and we are awaiting approval in the us this quarter we expect the launch in both the us and eu in the first quarter of  and see sales ramp up during the year our third major objective this year is enhancing the supply and customer service an area where we fell short last year as we continue with our supply network strategy we are making steady improvements most notably in apoquel were also investing to build capacity in product categories that will be an important part of our future revenue base in the near term we believe that a simplified supply chain with fewer manufacturing plants focused on expanding the set of products will improve our performance we also remain on track to complete the global implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system or erp in the first quarter the erp will support our overall efficiency goals and will help us better manage the processes and information to run our business and we continue to refine these systems over the course of the year well make certain we are exceeding our customers expectations our fourth major objective is around capital allocation and how we maximize our cost structure investment in rd and business development we are making a good progress in shaping our cost structure as part of the overall efficiency plan we announced last may that work has been accelerated and the additional cost savings has been included in our guidance it is equally important to realize that while we are implementing these plans we have remained committed to building the three interconnected capabilities that drive our success with customers us sales innovative rd and high quality and reliable manufacturing and supply the implementation has been resourced even as we go through changes in other areas of the company our investment in rd continues showing high return and support for our future growth i am very pleased to say that our efforts to refresh our portfolio with innovative vaccines offerings especially in companion animal are paying off last year we launched a new combination vaccine for dogs across the eu called versican plus and has been very well received by customers in the fourth quarter zoetis was granted a conditional license from the usda to market our canine influenza vaccine the first conditional licensed vaccine to help control disease associated with canine influenza the virus that is hn in december we received our us license for vanguard crlyme a vaccine that aids in the prevention of conditions associated with lyme disease in dogs and in november we expanded our innovator horse vaccine franchise in the us with the launch of our vaccine to aid in the prevention of leptospirosis meanwhile in aquatic health shortly after closing our deal with pharmaq in the fourth quarter one of their new vaccines for salmon received an emergency license in chile one of the worlds largest farmed fish markets our focus on enhancing our portfolio resulted in recent approvals for new indications and formulation of existing products in january zoetis received fda approval for an update to the labeling for cerenia which allow for intravenous administration during the surgical protocols that use medication that induces vomiting we launched a new formulation of lutalyse a reproductive product for use in dairy and beef cattle in the us we are also viewed as a partner of choice for all innovators in the industry in january we enter into an agreement with anatara lifesciences a company in australia well be evaluating their nonantibiotic antiinfective product as an alternative to antibiotics that could treat and control infections in farm animals and finally in terms of business development well continue to look for ma opportunities like we did last year with abbott animal health and pharmaq while we continue with our internal investment in new products lifecycle innovation and research alliances in summary we delivered an excellent  built in our diverse and marketleading portfolio of products for animal health we are getting significant traction in the business as we continue reducing complexity achieving efficiencies and freeing up resources for our most promising growth opportunities and we remain well positioned as the industry leader based on our core capabilities and singular focus on animal health with that let me turn things over to paul paul paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks thank you juan ramón let me put an exclamation point on juan ramóns overview of  what a terrific year we had if you think back to a year ago we had a number of very challenging initiatives in front of us most notably the design and implementation of the efficiency initiative that we announced in may and also the rollout of our enterprisewide sap system in our most important market the us as well as many other key locations around the world i can tell you that both of those projects put enormous pressure on the company on our colleagues and in some cases impacted our customers but we were able to stay on task overcome many challenges and deliver results that were very proud of so lets talk about our performance we had very strong sales growth in the us up  for the full year driven by good livestock sales primarily in cattle the addition of abbott animal health and increased supplies of apoquel in the international business we delivered operational sales growth of  which reflected good performance in major markets like brazil and china which grew  and  respectively partially offset by the business changes that we are making in venezuela we reduced our total operating expenses by  on an operational basis in  compared with  while growing revenue  operationally we kicked off our efficiency initiative in may and were able to capture meaningful savings in  particularly in the second half of the year when we reduced our operating expenses by  on an operational basis while we were growing revenue  operationally to be fair the true test of the operating efficiency improvements that we are making will come over the long term anyone can cut costs and improve profits in the short term the challenge is to improve profits and then grow that larger profit pool at an attractive rate to do that you need to be thoughtful about where how and how much you reduce costs we continue to prioritize and spend behind activities that deliver value to our customers and therefore support our growth namely our sales forces our rd engine and our supply chain so very good stuff for the full year  let me turn to the quarter quickly you can read the details of our fourth quarter results in the press release and tables but let me hit on a few highlights focusing on themes that may be impactful on our future results starting with revenue again good operational revenue growth of  in the quarter coming against a very strong quarter in  next improvement in operating efficiency total operating expenses were down  operationally in the quarter and this enabled us to grow adjusted net income by  operationally foreign currency continued to be a strong headwind for us as it is for most multinationals changes in fx rates reduced q reported revenue growth compared with the prioryear quarter by some  basis points theres a word for that its brutal setting aside fx we feel very good about the underlying drivers of our operational that is constant currency revenue growth for the quarter the  operational revenue growth included  from increased apoquel sales due to better supply  from the acquisition of the abbott animal health products  from price increases across the portfolio and  from new products yet these drivers were partially offset by a  decline of inline product revenues i want to point out thats primarily related to ongoing changes to our business model in venezuela and other countries like india which were initiated as part of our efficiency program as i said previously the changes we have made and are making to our business model in certain markets impacted our second half  performance and will have impact on our  revenue growth but these changes improve our prospects for longerterm revenue and profit growth thats the prize in the case of venezuela youll recall that we are reducing our activities there due to unfavorable economic conditions for multinational companies weve been selling down our inventories in the country limiting our future exports to venezuela and this quarter we decided to revalue our assets and liabilities there based on the free floating simadi exchange rate in the case of india we remain committed to our business there especially in our companion animal and poultry businesses with a direct field force however we are making changes in our approach to the dairy segment that segment has not consolidated in the way that we had expected over the last several years and so we are eliminating our dairy field force there and pursuing a distributor partnership to serve those market needs its worth noting that revenue from our other emerging market geography includes venezuela and india and declined  operationally in the fourth quarter if you want to go back and you can exclude india and venezuela other emerging markets would have grown by  the other emerging markets segment will continue to be an area where we see some noise in  as it includes the countries that will be most significantly impacted by the sku reductions as well as market changes that we are undertaking as part of our efficiency programs while im on the subject of international markets i know there continues to be general concerns with the outlook for countries like china and brazil given lots of recent media reports about their slower gdp growth and their economic outlooks generally demand for animal health products is tied to more stable growth drivers mainly the demand for animal proteins and the increased adoption and medicalization of pets both of which move as a function of population income and urbanization fundamentals in the animal health segments of both china and brazil remain strong and heres the proof for the full year  we grew revenue in china and brazil on an operational basis  and  respectively in the fourth quarter china and brazil grew  and  respectively both markets on a constant currency basis are growing at healthy rates and the growth prospects of these markets remain solid and so i pose the question rhetorically why is that for china its two things one is the fact that the consumption of animal proteins in china is growing and has continued to grow even in challenging economic times second is the goal of the chinese government to see an improvement in the productivity safety and quality of their food supply that means moving from smaller farms producing animal proteins to a more industrialized model and that model requires more animal health products to maintain and drive the productivity of the business now frankly as im saying this the second factor should be the first its a powerful driver and it will last for many years now turning to brazil brazil is a very developed livestock market and domestic consumption of animal protein is only a part of the equation brazil is a significant exporter of meat and so to the extent that the consumption falls within their borders they have the opportunity to use exports to maintain the health of their livestock businesses with the weakness of the real exports are even more attractive today so counter to what you might conclude when seeing negative headlines about conditions in brazil the brazilian livestock industry and the supporting animal health industry are quite strong using china and brazil as examples the key takeaway should be that we operate in an industry thats very resilient now i use that word quite a bit even in times of economic stress and that applies to developed as well as emerging markets turning to restructuring charges this quarter we had significant onetime costs that drove a decrease in our reported gaap net income and earnings per share let me explain this quarters major charges in terms of the three buckets that we use first the standup costs which are mainly associated with our separation from pfizer totaled  million in the quarter that work will be substantially completed by mid we recorded  million of costs associated with our supply network strategy and we are still in the early days of that initiative and we also recorded  million of onetime costs associated with our operational efficiency initiative which reflected the acceleration of some of those plans and the associated costs into the fourth quarter of  and finally we have taken accounting actions related to the revaluation of our bolivardenominated assets and liabilities in venezuela this quarter we believe its appropriate to change to the simadi rate as our exchange rate for venezuela and accordingly we recorded charges of approximately  million in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we also announced the sale or exit of five manufacturing sites in the us india and taiwan which we expect to generate proceeds in excess of  million of cash during  turning to guidance weve provided a bridge in our tables and slides to help show the changes in our guidance for  and  to spotlight the impact of changes in fx rates and changes to our operations in venezuela we now expect for the full year  revenue of between  billion to  billion reported diluted eps of between  and  per share and adjusted diluted eps between  and  per share for full year  we expect revenue between  billion and  billion reported diluted eps of between  and  per share and adjusted diluted eps between  and  per share our revised guidance reflects the impact of the european commissions decision on belgiums tax rulings and the related effect on our earnings which we disclosed in early january our effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income is expected to be approximately  in  and  in  in january we communicated that the changes to our tax rates reduced our expectations for adjusted diluted eps guidance for  and  by  and  per share respectively note that we expect to record onetime net tax charges during  of approximately  million of which approximately  million to  million will be recorded in q these q charges relate to the nullification of our belgium tax ruling by the european commission for the periods from  through  included in the total  million charge is an estimate of a future impact of the revaluation of deferred tax accounts currently associated with our belgium operation you can see these  million of onetime costs footnoted in our guidance bridge for  our revised guidance today also reflects our latest views of our operations in venezuela updated fx rates as of the end of january and other efficiency improvements to offset some of those impacts heres some really good news other than the impact of the change to our expected tax rate due to the ec ruling a factor over which we had no control were holding our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for both  and  we expect the momentum that we carried through q combined with the expected pace and magnitude of the efficiency initiative should enable us to offset the unrelenting headwinds of fx rates and the change to our business model in venezuela yeah were proud of that and since i have the floor and i like to talk about our company heres my summary of the year looking back at  what you see is another year where the global animal health industry posted solid midsingledigit growth despite many challenges in many economies around the world and you saw our company zoetis deliver strong operational growth of revenue up  by pulling on all of the levers that we have available to us the best animal health sales forces on the planet the most productive rd team in the industry valuegenerative ma and a supply chain that is a core strength of the company and we delivered operational growth of adjusted earnings per share of  for the year and im going to repeat that because its awesome adjusted earnings per share for the full year  increased  on a constant currency basis to  per share i call out the  because while we always measure ourselves on a constant currency basis at the end of the day we put an actual dollar amount on the tape way back in november of  we put  guidance on the – excuse me –  guidance on the table we guided revenue in the range of  billion to  billion and adjusted earnings per share of  to  since that time we like many multinational companies have been battered by fx that dramatically reduced our reported revenues but heres where were different from many of those other multinationals throughout  we held the line on our guidance for adjusted earnings per share and in november of  we actually raised the range to  to  and now we report actual results of  per share were able to do that because we as a management team brought forward a plan in may of last year to improve the efficiency of our cost structure and then we as a team got after it and reduced and controlled expenses to give us the best shot in delivering to you our shareholders the best earnings we could under the circumstances as i love to say pretty good so heres my pitch the global animal health industry is not just resilient it has characteristics that point to an extended period of predictable midsingledigit growth and the number one company in the global animal health industry is zoetis in the three years since weve been public weve put results on the board that support what we see as our key value drivers first we can grow our revenues at a rate equal to or faster than the midsingledigit growth rate expected for our industry second we can leverage our expense structure to drive increasing operating margins delivering profit growth faster than revenue growth and third we can intelligently allocate our capital actively manage our capital structure to grow adjusted earnings per share faster than operating profits in todays dystopian financial markets where investors may be looking for shelter from the storm i think my suggestion would be to look at companies in reverse alphabetical order and start with z for zoetis thats it for my prepared remarks lets get to qa keith questionandanswer session operator okay we can take our first question from kevin ellich with piper jaffray please go ahead kevin k ellich  piper jaffray  co broker good morning thanks for taking the questions i guess paul could you just go back to the contributions from acquisitions in the quarter i kind of missed those prepared remarks and then juan ramón i wanted to get an update on simparica as well i think in the press release it says you expect approval now in q i think previously you said first half of  so i guess whats the change and what should we expect heading into western vet paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah ill start kevin good morning its paul ill start with the components of the growth we had  operational revenue growth in the quarter and we recognize the goal was whole percentages here so theres rounding that comes into play but it was  from increased apoquel sales  from the acquisition of the abbott animal health products  from price increase across the portfolio and  from new products then the offset to that was about a  decline of what i guess well call revenues of all other products and again that is primarily related to the change in the business model in venezuela and countries like india and places that were affected by our efficiency initiative i hope that answers the question juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director thank you paul i will take the question on the simparica so we submitted to the fda all the information and based on the normal timing for approval we expect simparica to be approved in the us in the first quarter this all will be depending on final decision of the fda next question please operator and our next question comes from louise chen with guggenheim please go ahead louise chen  guggenheim securities llc hi thanks for taking my question so i do see slide  in your presentation but i was wondering if you could help us better understand the underlying sales growth for the year without the impact from restructuring and sku reductions and then also do you expect your sales growth to accelerate after these programs are completed and when might we actually see that thanks paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure louise its paul let me take that and thank you for asking the question louise because if you just take the headline and say gee were looking at  to  operational growth in revenue next year people say whats up with that so lets start with from the  to  the operational efficiency initiative the effect on skus and now venezuela and other markets where were going to change our model reduced that by some  basis points you can see that if you look at that slide   basis points so theres  to  if youre thinking about what our actual expectations are for normalized operational revenue growth in  v  and if you want to take pharmaq out of the equation and go whats the organic portion of that its about  basis points so as you look at that slide again ill call everyones attention to it we tried our level best to help you think about the strength of  because this is quite a strong year by showing you this waterfall slide so  to   basis points on the efficiency initiative sku reductions venezuela india et cetera gets you to  to  and if you want to look at that on an organic basis it would be  to  by taking pharmaq out of the mix before i concede the floor i want to say two things before i talk about  because we did change from  to  operational growth to  to  that is predominantly because we had previously articulated that range at the midpoint of our  guidance for revenue and as you saw we had strong revenue in q and for  it was about  million higher than that and that accounts for the change from  to  down to  to  we feel really good about what we put on the table in  and as we think about it we really are excited about  even though it will be masked a little bit by the changes that we are making to our model now last before i concede the floor you asked the question about what could we expect in  we expect a return to the same kind of solid growth that you would have expected in  but for the change in the efficiency initiative were currently forecasting on an operational basis  to  thats pretty solid and thats being driven mainly by new products next question please operator and the next question comes from alex arfaei with bmo capital markets alex arfaei  bmo capital markets united states good morning folks thank you for all the details on the slides and congratulations on a strong operational performance in  paul cost of sales grew at a higher rate than revenues in the quarter and as a result gross margin was lower year over year and sequentially versus q i was wondering if you could give us your thoughts there on gross margin and just a general question for the both of you your stock has obviously been underperforming despite this strong operational performance im wondering if you could give us your thoughts on that and is there an opportunity for a more aggressive share buyback at these levels thank you paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure its paul ill take the q margin that was predominantly due to fx again i would look at the full year and how we came out and it was in line with what we were expecting i know alex weve traveled together a little bit you look at a quarter there can be a lot of variability that sneaks into the equation you compare it against this that and the other thing things happen in a day period that smooth themselves out over the year i would look at the odd margin that we put on the board for the full year and thats indicative of the strength but the one thing in the fourth quarter was fx fx is hard to forecast when it flows through cost of sales but it sure does the second thing i think you asked a question about the share price were watching our company along with many others lose value at least in the eyes of shareholders or people who are holding our stock we continue to do what we can do were driving real fundamental value you posed the question about our share buyback and the scale of that et cetera id point out that when we were last in the window i guess which was in the early part of november the stock was  –  i think and im going from memory here  –  and we elected at that point in time to increase the pace of our purchases as everybody can do the math we bought about  million a quarter through  were currently buying stock back at a pace of about  million a quarter i know thats not a ton but as i said also many times we had a lot of calls on cash in  but even so we elected to increase the pace at which we were wanting to acquire shares so i hope that answers the questions juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director i will add a comment here alex i think that in many cases our company is still associated with the human pharmaceutical industry and discussions on prices for instance have been affecting the human pharmaceutical industry while this should not be having any impact in our share value our prices as i mentioned in my comments are completely dependent on thirdparty payers we price based on the value that we can demonstrate to our customers and our customers are not only buying and paying the products they buy from us so this is something that in my opinion should be also included when different investors or analysts also define the value of zoetis and also the value of the animal health industry in general paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president next question please operator and the next question is from erin wilson with credit suisse erin wilson  credit suisse securities usa llc broker great thanks for taking my questions how should we think about the quarterly progression of the us livestock business and could you characterize the overall health of the us livestock industry just more broadly and then one on rd on the parasiticide front should we expect that youre ready to launch as soon as simparica gets approval in the us and then with the potential flea tick and heartworm combination chewable product longer term how long in the pipeline or how far along in the pipeline is this product and when should we expect it i guess to launch and is it in the guidance juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director so thank you erin for your question in terms of the launch of simparica we are ready to launch as soon as we get approval from the fda were also ready to launch not only in us but also in the european markets and the team is ready the plans are in place and we have a product to supply to the market you also asked a question about the livestock progression in the us and definitely we have seen that in general the livestock has been performing well in  in terms of the quarters the fourth quarter has been stronger than expected because already in the last year we reported very strong revenue growth and in this year also we grew significantly and in terms of the different areas of livestock we see also opportunities in cattle we see opportunities in poultry and we see opportunities also in swine we expect also in  the momentum will continue we see positive trends in the cattle industry mainly on beef that we expect that the number of animals will increase by  or  and this will expect also will drive additional use of animal health products and you also asked about paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president the combination product juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director the flea and tick and the heartworm definitely our rd team is working on developing this product and finalizing all the information for submitting all the dossiers to the fda we have not yet communicated when we plan to have this product into the market as we get closer to the finalization of all the different filings then well communicate to the market and this has not been included in our guidance for  so next question please operator well go next to john kreger with william blair john c kreger  william blair  co llc hi thanks very much you mentioned that you had some issues last year with customer service i think you said mainly around apoquel can you just expand upon that is that issue behind you how comfortable are you that you will not have any residual issues as we move through  and then paul maybe just talk a little bit more about longer term your tax rate thoughts do you think  is the long term right number to use or is there an opportunity to maybe push that lower thanks juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director so we have had supply issues for apoquel and the supply issue has been resolved now we have now the process for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient that had been the bottleneck of manufacturing apoquel we have a process which is much more robust and much more consistent and we are really producing all the product that will be delivered in  and well increase significantly the supply to the market we are also planning to expand apoquel to the rest of the world in where the product has been approved and we plan to do that in  so we are convinced that apoquel will deliver significant growth and all the issues that we faced in  will be behind us we also reported in  that the implementation of the new erp also created some issues in terms of deliveries of products into the market we are very pleased now how the implementation of the erp has been now performed in the us we have now  of our orders delivered the same day which is a significant achievement and we are working on improving there the rest of the functions that also are provided to the customers we expect that also the erp will be supporting our operations in a very efficient way in  and this is something we plan to finalize all implementation of the new system in this quarter and then moving forward to maximize the way that well be supporting our business paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president john its paul ill take the tax question first let me just say we were very disappointed with the european commissions kind of stating that the belgium tax rulings like we had are illegal and essentially nullified our arrangement there were disappointed because the belgians have been very supportive weve built a terrific operation there i think ive said in a prior public forum the belgians on the contrary have been one of the more responsible countries with respect to tax policy and how they used it to attract employment and investment into their country and its a shame so set that aside were very disappointed it obviously was not something that we were planning on and lets pretend that that didnt happen for a second we had previously articulated we thought our tax rate in call it  would have been on the order of  our adjusted etr roughly  and now its  so we lost a couple of hundred basis points there in  but what i would suggest to you is just as we had articulated with respect to our structure before this happened we can grind that down but we wouldnt be grinding it down the frustrating thing for us is we were doing pretty well fine tuning our global operating model to be efficient and here we have to go back and we have to change course a little bit so not something – it was not a happy day for us but were responding the best way that we can and i think the way we look at it is we just add  basis points higher etr in  and our job is to grind that down next question please operator and the next question comes from chris schott with jpmorgan christopher schott  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks very much just a couple of here first on the  impact from the sku reduction in  i guess now that were further along in that process any surprises in terms of customer behavior in terms of the sku changes and i guess is there an opportunity for that number to be lower than  either through uptake of alternatives of those products or just other initiatives you put in place and the second question which is as were looking out  just any dynamics we should be keeping in mind for modeling this year in terms of quarterly progression i guess are there any particularly difficult or easy comps that we should be watching as were kind of thinking about the quarters this year thanks very much juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director thank you chris what we evaluated very carefully when we decided to reduce skus on how will be the impact to our customers we made sure that none of the skus that we are eliminating has no alternative to our customers these alternatives can be from our competitors or can be alternatives in our portfolio the  impact in our revenues is the net result of reduction and also the assumption that some of these reductions of skus will be moved to other skus in our portfolio in terms of reaction from our customers i think in some cases well they will like to have these products in their portfolio but they also understand that more important than offering  skus is ensuring that we have a reliable supply what we want to make sure that when they place an order they get the order on time to treat or protect the animals and this is one of the important strategic rationales for our sku rationalization it was not only to improve gross margin but also to ensure that our supply to the market is much more consistent and we can meet all customer submissions and then paul will take the question on the phasing in terms of quarters paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president i think there are two things that id be mindful of one is how the sku reduction plays out with respect to our revenues youll recall that we announced this program in the middle part of  and so were just starting to see here in q an alignment to q and q the impacts of the sku rationalization and it will be relative to the prior year it will be a significant factor but we will have to keep our eye on the second part is with respect to our cost our efficiency initiative we continue to ramp up the amount of savings that we are seeing flow through and of course the first half of last year we had a modest amount of cost containment or that occurred in the first half but that steps up and we currently are tracking as you saw with an  operational reduction in operating expenses in q tracking at a much lower rate so that will be a very helpful driver on the operating expense side in the first half of the year and then that benefit if you will comparing back to the prior year will moderate over the second half of the year i think thats about all we want to cover on phasing just lastly ill say it again and again and again we look at our business on a yearly basis trying to – i know you have to and thats what you do and all and well try to be as helpful as we can with respect to the phasing but we run our business on an annual basis next question please operator our next question is from jami rubin with goldman sachs jami rubin  goldman sachs  co thank you just a couple first paul maybe you can answer this on the  contribution from price can you talk about the outlook how did that look on a global basis us versus outside of the us and what is the outlook for price increases going forward both in the us and across different geographies and then juan ramón just a question for you as you are now congratulations three years as an independent company and its been very exciting to see how zoetis has evolved and achieved such tremendous success in a short period of time congratulations but maybe you could just sort of step back and tell us – when i look at the industry the animal health industry it doesnt seem that a whole lot has changed it still remains highly fragmented weve seen a little bit of movement with novartis swapping its business to lilly youve made a couple small acquisitions but by and large the industry hasnt changed much do you see more consolidation going forward or do you see some of your peers spinning out their animal health businesses like you have done for yourself and what does this all mean for your future in terms of ma thanks very much juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director thank you jami and i will try to answer both questions so in terms of the  so the  as you mentioned its a global increase and in terms of where we see this  in the different geographies definitely we have been very consistent in the us with price increases of around  and in the rest of the markets it depends so in high inflationary markets we increased significantly the prices to compensate for inflation and also to compensate for foreign exchange in some markets where the economies are – the inflation is very stable or probably not having any inflation at all so we are also trying to adjust our prices based on these situations so in europe or japan and some other markets we have been increasing prices but at a lower rate than in the us or some of the markets where we had the opportunity to increase the prices because of inflation the second question was related to the consolidation of the industry and the top four or five now animal healthcare companies represent almost  of the total market which has already been increased significantly from some years ago do i see opportunities for further consolidation i think there are still opportunities especially on the second tier of companies after these four or five companies we see opportunities for the consolidation we expect now the merger of boehringer ingelheim and merial being completed theres another round of consolidation and maybe in the future also well see some additional consolidation definitely the consolidation would be limited because of antitrust issues but without these antitrust issues or managing these antitrust issues definitely consolidation can represent a good opportunity for the animal health industry the last comment i want to add is that the top  companies in animal health represent something like  of the total market on the  which is remaining we have maybe hundreds of companies that in where i expect that this will be a significant consolidation here and paul will add some comments in terms of the pricing paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure i mean jami asked a specific question i think jami was trying to get to where is our pricing power for the full year emphasis full year our price added approximately – a little better than  overall but us is about  and international was about  again a lot of rounding here but more price increases outside the us than in next question please jami rubin  goldman sachs  co thank you paul operator the next question comes from doug tsao with barclays douglas tsao  barclays capital inc hi good morning thanks for taking the questions maybe if you could provide a little bit more of an update in terms of how you will sort of increase the availability of apoquel is this what we start now in terms of broadening the number of veterinarians who will have access to the product or is it going to be focused more on current – expanding to new patients also if you can just provide some commentary in terms of the mfa business and how its faring right now one of your competitors spoke about some regulatory headwinds in that business and whether youre seeing those as well thank you juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director thank you doug in terms of the increase for apoquel so let me start saying that we have now two sources of the production of api and the second source that will be a company in switzerland which is called siegfried will double the capacity of the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient we plan to now offer apoquel to more veterinarians and also to offer more available product to existing veterinarians at the same time also the plan is to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where the product was put on hold because of product availability so we are convinced that during  well be able to meet all the demand from the market in terms of mfas i think mfas in our case continue growing very strongly and we have the advantage of – thats right this is the diversity of our portfolio its not only diversity in terms of therapeutic areas or in terms of different types of products but also within the mfas we have a lot of diversity and for products that will be maybe facing some challenge because of changes on the approach of the use of antibiotics and i mentioned in the medical important antibiotics in mfas with indication of a growth promotion this will be eliminated but in our portfolio we also have a nonmedical important antibiotics in mfas that can be a good replacement for those that will be eliminated we have in total in mfas  million in sales and we grew operationally in  by  so definitely we expect that those are probably the only indication of growth promotion which are medically important for human health that will have an impact in the revenues but this impact will be minimum next question please operator well go next to mark schoenebaum with evercore isi mark j schoenebaum  evercore isi hey paul my email went up during your prepared remarks i just wanted to say that it was really a brutally awesome prepared remarks section especially the part about how we should reverse the alphabet i love that thats a great idea but in all seriousness i had a bunch of questions but ill limit it to  because most people have been doing it number one given all the opacity that – you guys have tried to do everything you can to make it clear but this the confusion i guess that fx potentially creates why not synthetically hedge against the effects on that at least in that net income line especially after the turmoil this year although you guys have done a great job helping us understand the effect and then number two maybe i missed this but i didnt hear you break out apoquel sales on q i was wondering if you could i apologize if i just missed it if you could break those out in the us and also the rest of world and if you already answered that one then my question would be the  to  normalized organic operational growth what are the components of that for  that you see thanks paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure ill start with the fx i think when youre looking at trying to hedge operations around the world against foreign currencies you have two choices you can either in nontechnical terms let it fly which is what we do with respect to operations like many many other multinational companies do or you can attempt to hedge if you hedge you hedge within a quarter and the analysis that weve done has suggested that youre essentially chasing down you limit the cost of the hedges ultimately make it like a less than fruitful exercise now others will tell you that they can do it and thats okay that would be their point of view i point out that a couple of the currencies that tend to be the most volatile there are not markets for us to go out and hedge i think theyre not deep enough theyre not efficient enough and so you wouldnt be able to fully offset that i think i love your word there opacity i might have mispronounced that were trying our best to let the market follow along with as much of the information that we have that we can share with you so you can decide how were performing we do now and we will continue to manage ourselves on an operational basis meaning a constant currency basis and i will hope against hope perhaps that at some point in the future here well see some more stability in the foreign exchange rates and that well enjoy the positive upside not from an operational perspective but from a reported perspective of currency fx rates going in the opposite direction juan do you want to take the apoquel sales or would you like me to juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director the apoquel sales i think we had more than  million in  its about  million this was below initial expectations and the only reason for that was that ensuring that we have enough product to supply to customers and not increasing the number of customers having access until we have the certainty that the product would be available now were having a situation that we increase significantly the production and well be able to increase the deliveries to our customers globally in international markets i think we had about  million and then the rest was in the us but its important to understand that in international markets it was very limited number of countries where we have the product available in the market you also asked about components of our organic growth  to  and paul will provide the details of this paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure ill start first of all we expect to continue to be able to take consistent price across our portfolio thats a driver second is theres a significant impact from new products in  which frankly will be an even bigger impact on  and then just performance of our portfolio when i say new products im focusing on the ones that you can see that make a difference id point out that we have lots of new products that we dont talk about necessarily individually and maybe individually dont move the needle but in the aggregate they sure do  to  normalized operational growth in revenue next year would be terrific and then again going into  new products help even more juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director and mark let me correct the total revenue that we generated internationally internationally was  million and then the rest was in the us and i want to insist that in the international markets we have very limited number of markets and also limited supply so the potential in both us and international is much higher so next question please operator well go next to david risinger with morgan stanley david r risinger  morgan stanley  co llc yes thanks very much my questions are financial obviously youve covered a lot of ground on the business and the outlook so paul two questions first could you please discuss the outlook for  cash flow including cash flow from operations and then planned uses of cash and then second if you could just comment on the quarterly progression throughout the year just to make sure that we set up our models appropriately and we understand the different variables to consider thanks very much paul s herendeen  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure ill start with the discussion around expected cash flow recall that we try to call them out each and every quarter we have a large amount of expenses that were incurring with respect to one the standup from pfizer second the operational efficiency initiative and now we add to the list a potential trueup of our international taxes in light of the ecs comments if you look at our guidance tables we call out the amount or the expected amount of the acquisition costs that we expect to incur in  and then again in  those are i would call them – theyre not normal and they will go away and most of them will go away towards the latter part of  but in  its a fairly significant call on our cash secondarily we continue to be in a phase of investing in our supply chain we continue to invest capital there so our capex is tracking at a rate that exceeds our ongoing depreciation rate so netnet we continue to invest there of course we called out that we now have a program that everybody can do the math where at least the current expectation is were purchasing shares at the rate of  million a quarter its  million this year plus our dividend you can do that math and those are other than our earnings are the things that you need to take into consideration when thinking about our cash flow i dont want to stop without speaking about efficiency of working capital that is something that is to come its not something that you would see necessarily in  and not in an enormous way in  by the end of this quarter we expect to have our erp system up and running in all of our locations around the world which is going to give us the ability to then implement tools to much better manage primarily our investment in our inventories our receivables i think we do a pretty good job there and we certainly do the same things as everyone else with respect to payables but we will not start to see some maybe significant cash flow from the improvement in cost of working capital really until  i wasnt specific there david i wasnt specific for the reason we dont want to provide specific guidance with respect to free cash flow but i believe weve provided each of the components that will enable you to look out to   and then beyond i think when you get out into the latter part of this decade our depreciation should start to normalize at a level close to our depreciation amount ill stop there juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director you also asked about the quarterly progression for  let me provide a couple of comments here so first we expect that the new product launches will have no impact in the first quarter and we expect that these products ramping up during the year also apoquel we expect that the biggest impact well see from the second quarter of  as we also extend the product availability in the markets where the product has been already introduced and we also launch in new markets in terms of expenses of course also our efficiency program will have much more impact in the second half than in the first half because in the second half we plan really to complete most of the actions that we took as part of the announcements that we made in may and this also will have a positive impact in our results in the second half of the year next question please operator well go next to kathy miner with cowen  company kathy m miner  cowen  co llc thank you good morning two questions one first on pharmaq when you acquired the company you had stated that it was growing about  is that still a good estimate going forward or could it be higher given their late stage pipeline that you talked about and also do you continue to expect it to be neutral to eps this year and then accretive thereafter or could that accelerate and the second question just has to do on trends outside of the us in livestock we saw the issue in france last year where they changed the legislation on antibiotics are there any other areas that we should look for in  where there may be similar changes thank you juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director so thank you kathy for the questions in pharmaq what we communicated is that we plan to generate that revenue for  million in  and  million in  and at the end of the year pharmaq reported revenues of close to  million so we see a significant increase in terms of our revenues what we saw during the due diligence when we acquire in terms of the pipeline its performing now with the launch of the product in chile that it was under this emergency license and we will continue progressing in the plans that we have for pharmaq so we are very excited about the opportunities of pharmaq we are working also in terms of integrating the two companies but ensuring that pharmaq remains a leader in aquatic health with enough identity to maximize the relationship with the customers that they already built through many years in terms of the comments that you made in france definitely in  we saw an impact because of the change of the legislation in france this was affecting antibiotics we expect also that antibiotics will continue having discussions and restrictions in some of the markets this has been incorporated in our guidance for  and  and we also think that the projections that external sources are making about the total animal health industry and also the growth in antibiotics are consistent with what with our projections so the industry will be growing about  antibiotics is expected to grow at half of this rate the advantage for zoetis is that it will have in our portfolio antibiotics which are injectables which are considered as premium antibiotics that are kept by veterinarians as a resource to ensure that they are treating and in some cases protecting also animals against infections so we are confident that the impact that it will have in antibiotics will be lower in our revenue but in any case all these elements have been incorporated in our projections next question please operator well go next to jeff holford with jefferies jeff if you want to check your mute button please jeffrey holford  jefferies llc hi can you hear me now juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director yes we can jeffrey holford  jefferies llc okay great thank you good morning i just want to ask a couple of questions around sanofi and boehringer first off if you expect that business combination or that potential business combination to have any impact on the competitive environment for you as you go forward into  and beyond any specific areas of concern or opportunity there and then second just as you got two european companies coming together there youve talked very briefly in the past about potential inversions lack of opportunities thats potentially two less opportunities now just any updated thoughts there is thats really looking beyond you now to potentially look at any kind of inversions or spinversions out there thank you juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director thank you jeff for the question and definitely the sanofibi merger will create a very strong competitor it will be the second largest animal health company in our industry but we dont think that the combination of the two companies will create additional competitive challenge to zoetis we have the scale we have the diversity and we have the business model that has been proven very successful in the past and will continue also being successful in the future the productivity that we have in rd is also showing very high levels so we are confident that well continue growing in line or faster than market so we are projecting in fact in  and  were growing faster than market despite of sanofibi or despite of all these additional consolidations in our industry sanofi and bi they are two european companies that potentially can be maybe an opportunity for tax inversion but also creating significant antitrust issues to zoetis so we continue assessing opportunities that to further consolidate not with the only objective of saving on tax but a combination of synergies that we can generate in terms of revenue in terms of costs opportunities on reducing our effective tax rate and definitely creating a value to the company next question please operator next well go for a followup with kevin ellich with piper jaffray kevin k ellich  piper jaffray  co broker hey i was just wondering if you could comment about the i guess juan ramón did you say you guys have – supply of simparica is ready for launch i just wanted to make sure i had that right juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director yes i said that simparica product is ready for launch and as soon as we have approval for fda well be launching that in the us and also in europe so we have the product in our warehouses operator and it does appear we have no further questions ill return the floor to you juan ramón for closing remarks juan ramón alaix  chief executive officer  director thank you very much and thank you for joining us today as we continue through  we are determined to make the most of our business model our interconnected capabilities and the fundamental drivers of growth in animal health well complete our operational changes becoming less complex more efficient and more agile and well invest in growth opportunities to strengthen our business i am confident that these steps will help improve our margins better serve our customers and build shareholder value over the long term and i look forward to reporting to you on our progress in each of these areas thank you very much operator okay ladies and

on animal health    global newscategories animal health  corporate news interview zoetis ceo discusses companys singular focus on animal health source feedinfo news service dated   january   only established as a new company two years ago zoetis today claims the leading spot in the global animal health industry at the recent jp morgan healthcare conference zoetis ceo juan ramón alaix stated that his company is  bigger in terms of annual sales than its closest large competitor merck and enjoys a market share of close to  we are generating a growth which is faster than our competitors alaix told his san francisco audience and we are not only leading in total but you see that we are leading in many different dimensions in terms of geographies we have a very strong position also a very strong position in terms of the therapeutic areas which are relevant for our customers in animal health and we have a very strong position in terms of species zoetis was heavily featured under the media spotlight during the second half of  the company obtained a conditional green light for its vaccine for the prevention of pedv a virus which significantly impacted pig herds last year it also announced plans to acquire the companion animal assets of abbott animal health for usd  million activist investor william ackmans pershing square capital holdings also revealed a stake in zoetis opening up the rumor mill again and finally zoetis held an investor day in november during which growth plans were outlined as well as financial goals through  feedinfo news service spoke to juan ramón alaix and asked him to reflect back on the company developments of  and share his views on industry issues feedinfo news service mr alaix you were appointed chief executive officer of zoetis in july  what lessons would you say you have learned from this position juan ramón alaix i’ve learned many lessons in my time as ceo of zoetis but perhaps the most important is the value that we can bring to our customers and shareholders through our singular focus on animal health this focus differentiates us from our largest competitors and gives us an advantage i recently spoke to the head of one of our largest customers about our “singular focus” he told me that they were initially skeptical when we became independent but he said they have seen a definite difference and advantage in the way we operate deal with them and focus on their needs every colleague at zoetis knows they can have a big impact on our company’s success and we are focused on doing even better feedinfo news service can you provide a brief overview of zoetis’ scale with regard to the farm animal side of your business how does it compare to companion animal health and diagnostics juan ramón alaix we have the most diverse portfolio in the usd  billion animal health market spanning livestock and companion animal products in   of our sales were in the livestock animal segment and  were in the companion animal segment  total sales were usd  billion in terms of market share by species we are number one in cattle and swine number two in poultry and number two in companion animal products we are also quite diverse in terms of product categories to give you some background our portfolio ranked number one in antiinfectives which represented approximately  of our  revenue we ranked number two in medicated feed additives which represented approximately  of our revenue number two in vaccines which represented approximately  of our revenue and our portfolio ranked third in parasiticides which represented approximately  of our revenues feedinfo news service zoetis has a very diverse portfolio with more than  product lines boon or bane juan ramón alaix while it can be complex to manage  product lines having a diverse portfolio provides strength in serving our varied customer needs and it is a benefit to our financial performance we leverage our broad portfolio of products and customer relationships to provide the most relevant and meaningful solutions that customers need our portfolio also helps us maintain steady and durable revenue streams since we are not dependent on any single product for a large portion of our revenues there is less volatility and potential risk for instance our largest product is only  of our revenue and our top  products account for  feedinfo news service when activist investor bill ackman acquired a stake in zoetis in november roughly  it was speculated that ackman was pushing for a sale of zoetis moreover zoetis cfo paul herendeen in november said that as a public company zoetis is for sale every day if someone made the right offer could you let us know what your stance is and should zoetis be subject to an acquisition in  what ideal takeover candidate profile are you looking for juan ramón alaixceozoetis juan ramón alaix we believe zoetis has the business model operational discipline and strategies in place to create shareholder value but we welcome the perspectives of all shareholders  we are focused on our performance and execution and wouldn’t comment on rumor or speculation about potential acquisitions or takeovers feedinfo news service in november zoetis also announced it would acquire a portfolio of pet drugs from abbott laboratories for approximately usd  million can we consider abbott  mainly veterinary surgical products  as a complementary business for zoetis and with regard to zoetis own ma strategy in general can we expect more bolton acquisitions of complementary businesses juan ramón alaix the addition of abbott animal health assets is an excellent complement to the zoetis companion animal business and addresses the challenges our customers face today in effectively raising and caring for animals that are living longer and receiving more intensive medical and surgical treatment this acquisition also strengthens our pain portfolio and our diagnostics business so we can deliver more customized solutions to veterinarians we have certainly added complementary businesses to strengthen our company in the past but as a matter of policy we do not comment or speculate on potential ma activity in order for us to enter into any new space it would have to make strategic sense and create sustained value for our business and shareholders we have the most diverse portfolio in the usd  billion animal health market  we are number one in cattle and swine number two in poultry and number two in companion animal products      juan ramón alaix feedinfo news service zoetis received conditional regulatory approval last summer to market vaccines for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus do you think pedv is a wildcard for  is the company ready to supply across north america should there be a resurgence on the contrary if pedv doesnt resurface would you consider all the efforttimeresources put into the pedv vaccine development as lost juan ramón alaix pedv was a significant issue for swine producers in the us in  and increasingly in other markets around the world we were very pleased to be able to provide our us customers with a conditionally licensed ped vaccine that could help address this devastating disease and demonstrate our commitment to these customers bringing this vaccine to market quickly – in a little more than a year since the disease was identified in the us – exemplifies our commitment to supporting veterinarians and livestock producers with highquality vaccines that can help control the evolving and complex threat of emerging infectious diseases regardless of what happens with the spread of pedv in  we would consider the resources put into the development of this vaccine as essential to maintaining our role as an innovative leader in animal health our customers had an urgent need that required a rapid response and our people used their experience knowledge and expertise to meet the challenge feedinfo news service zoetis also recently announced the reintroduction of zoamix® zoalene for the prevention and control of coccidiosis in poultry after a year stop the us poultry industry loses an estimated usd  million a year to coccidiosis do you see that number decreasing next year with zoetis coccidiosis management strategy and action plan returning to the forefront juan ramón alaix coccidiosis is an ever present disease and the industry needs all the tools it can get to manage it bringing zoamix® back will allow for new management strategies to address this challenge and allow producers some new flexibility in designing protocols thanks to the unique characteristics of the product a new coccidiosis management tool will also allow for the resting of other products in order to protect their efficacy zoamix® can also be used in programs where the use of antibiotics is restricted it will be an extremely valuable tool in these settings as these producers have fewer tools to rely on to manage the disease feedinfo news service zoetis produces therapeutic antibiotics to treat animal diseases but is the company feeling any indirect consequences of the increasing global pressure on the use of infeed antibiotics agps juan ramón alaix at zoetis we believe antibiotic medicines are a precious resource and by using them responsibly today we will work to help protect their efficacy for tomorrow zoetis supports the responsible use of antibiotic medicines in animals and in people we believe that veterinary professionals should be involved in decisions about the use of antibiotic medicines in animals for several reasons to protect both animal and human health to assure the safety of the food supply and to help reduce the risk of resistance we are committed to supporting our veterinary and livestock farmer customers with the knowledge and tools to use antibiotic medicines responsibly and properly according to their labeling we comply with all regulatory requirements and work with authorities to ensure that appropriate label precautions are in place to assure the safety of these products for animals their caregivers and the public feedinfo news service there has been some scrutiny recently on zoetis antibiotic ceftiofur and the frequency with which its being misused on farms across america how can you explain this  what is the company putting in place to reassure its customers and to another extent the consumer  since we are not dependent on any single product for a large portion of our revenues there is less volatility and potential risk our largest product is only  of our revenue and our top  products account for       juan ramón alaix juan ramón alaix all ceftiofur products are fdaapproved for specific animal diseases and available only through veterinary prescription we think the role of the veterinarian is critical in this issue problems arise when the product is administered incorrectly and without the involvement of a veterinarian we urge our customers to strictly follow drug treatment protocols and withhold times and to only market animals that are healthy we strongly support judicious use of antibiotics by providing producers and veterinarians with ongoing education and training so that ceftiofur products are used appropriately and within the label guidelines outlined by fda zoetis advocates for the involvement of a veterinarian in any animal health decisions as part of an ongoing veterinaryclientpatient relationship zoetis also sponsors the largest antibiotic resistance monitoring program in the animal health industry to ensure ceftiofur is used carefully and remains effective for the diseases for which it is a cure  we also have a number of resources to help our customers keep their animals healthy in the first place as well as robust protocols and training in case antibiotic treatment is needed to restore animal health and protect the food supply   feedinfo news service mr alaix to conclude animal genetics has been mentioned as a big focus for zoetis going forward can you let us know where the company is headed in this area juan ramón alaix zoetis is focused on the role of genetics as a key driver for the health and productivity of livestock with the world’s need for protein growing and resources at a premium producers need to use all the tools they have to produce more with less genetics fits very well with the many health and productivity solutions that zoetis provides to producers across the globe zoetis is well positioned to drive the adoption of this technology by creating new information based products and educating our customers on the application of genetics more alerts from       feedinfo news service   all rights reserved   juan ramón alaix ceo success stories  merryck  co juan ramón alaix ceo

david reimer ceo merryck  co americasas the leader of a highly complex global business unit with general management responsibilities spanning rd business development and new product marketing juan ramón alaix proved he could effectively run a businessbut was he ready to be a ceoafter rising through the leadership ranks with years of progressively more demanding and broaderinscale responsibilities under their belts many motivated and highachieving leaders will immediately answer that question with a resounding “yes”but often it’s those who are willing to say “not yet” who end up being most successful in the top jobthat is alaix’s storyin a remarkably forthright “how i did it” segment for the harvard business review alaix shared how his willingness to recognize what he still needed to learn along with a commitment to his ongoing professional development has helped him be successful as ceo of zoetis the animal health business that spun off from pfizer in an ipo in the kind of frank honesty by alaix—with himself and with others—shows a level of selfawareness and vulnerability that is not always typical among rising ceos in fact a lot of ceos don’t like to admit they weren’t born as fullyformed executives“often” one seattlebased cmo told us “a ceo isn’t willing to show that kind of vulnerability publicly even though his team—and possibly the entire organization—can see a different side to the leader” as he observed a ceo who can’t show vulnerability is in fact one who could benefit the most from ongoing developmenta recent hbr blog “to create a real connection show vulnerability” by michael simmons elaborates on this and explores the mistaken assumption that if people find out who we really are underneath they’d remove themselves from our livessimmons writes “only presenting an idealized version of ourselves separates us from others” the reality is if we share the ups and downs of our human experience in the right way in the right context we build deeper connectionsalaix’s journey from successful business president to successful ceo included a relationship and connection with patrick gournay a merryck mentor who previously held the top job at companies like arc international the body shop international and regional leadership roles at the danone groupan independent outsider who had been through it himself—and knew what alaix would be facing—gournay had no stake in the game at pfizer his only agenda was to help alaix take a step back and get clear on what the role would require of him what would be different and how he would need to adaptafter reading juan ramon’s story a ceo of a m business shared with us this response “if someone with mr alaix’s background and accomplishments had no problem admitting he could benefit from training then there should be no shame in my doing the same”so yes it takes a willingness and an openness but the results speak for themselves as alaix put it “i’m a big believer in preparation and the need for training no matter where you are in your career or how high in a corporation you’ve already risen…the time i spend getting ready for a challenge and the openness i have to coaching are investments that always pay me back”it’s an interesting benchmark for a leader how honest is he or she willing to be about their own professional developmentclick the link to view our
