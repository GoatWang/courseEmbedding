job lara oreilly oct    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print lisa utzschneider yahoo chief revenue officer john lamparskigetty images a question yahoo chief revenue officer lisa utzschneider gets asked all the time is how do you manage to balance your highprofile highintensity role with being a mom utzschneider is marissa mayers righthand woman responsible for growing yahoos ad sales business that means developing ad products and plans meeting with clients appearing on stage at events and managing a giant global sales team she also has a yearold daughter utzschneiders tip for anyone else in a similar position of juggling a busy job with trying to do the best in bringing up their children is to be present she told business insider personally one of my goals is that my yearold never asks me to put my phone down i make such a concerted effort when i’m home and i’m with her until she falls asleep utzschneider calls those times at home her sacred time and makes it her mission when shes in new york no matter what to get home to read to her daughter before she goes to bed its really important to get your priorities clear and that you also share them so your team understands oh ok so calling lisa at  at night isn’t great but you can call her after  utzschneider says mayer has been incredibly supportive in helping her manage her personal and professional life from day one of starting at the company in  utzschneider joined from amazon where she was the vp of global advertising sales for its media group mayer recognizes that different people have different work styles and everyone gets to the finish line a little differently she does what she can to support and nourish that work style and she encourages me to approach the business in the way that i think is the right way to approach it utzschneider said i couldn’t say enough about her in terms of how supportive she has been to me in my role and also of our sales organization but while utzschneider is in the higher echelons of a supportive organization now it hasnt always been that way during her career the  movement recent published a survey about the gender bias and sexism women still experience in the ad industry — from being excluded from meetings to being less well compensated than their male peers we asked utzschneider whether she had ever experienced anything similar early on in her career utzschneider used to work for companies on the west coast of the us while she has always been based in new york meaning she has been on lots of calls where she is the only woman andor the only person dialling in remotely utzschneider said i remember early in my career forcing myself and pushing myself to speak up to speak often to make sure i was heard that i was articulate that i was contributing to the conversation to make sure that if i was getting cut off i would call the person out on it or speak to them after the meeting and say hey this just happened and i ask moving forward to give me space in meetings so i can speak up she describes the technique as similar to exercise the more you do it the more you develop the muscle and the stronger you get to the point where it becomes second nature utzschneider added i knew throughout my career if i wasnt able to find my voice it would be very difficult to be successful in a senior level job this was an extract from can our full interview

media group “emarketer is a great onestop shop for the amazon media group and our sales team” —lisa utzschneider former vice president of global advertising amazon media group an interview with lisa utzschneider former vice president of global advertising at amazon media group lisa utzschneider leads amazoncom’s global display advertising efforts she joined amazon in september  assuming responsibility for ad sales and operations for a range of amazonowned and operated websites including amazon imdb and digital photography review in this role utzschneider leads the product development and sales strategies for advertising solutions across the amazon portfolio prior to amazon she spent a decade at microsoft leading a variety of advertising initiatives in product development sales strategy and online industry standards capacities her last position at microsoft was general manager of the sales and account services group editors’ note lisa utzschneider was interviewed by emarketer in january  she was named senior vice president sales americas yahoo in october  what are you responsible for as vice president of global advertising sales lisa utzschneider i’m responsible for our global advertising business which today consists of a few primary areas the first is display advertising across our owned and operated sites including amazoncom imdbcom dp review and diaperscom the second is advertising on connected devices including kindle ereaders kindle fire tablets and mobile both imdb’s mobile apps and the amazon shopping app the third is connecting with amazon customers on the internet and the fourth area which i’m very excited about is video let me take a step back and provide some context amazon is in its 9th year of building a really robust retail platform for our customers as a result we’ve also built a large loyal customer base of more than  million active customer accounts worldwide about seven years ago we saw an exciting opportunity to help those customers find and discover new and great products through advertising on our sites and to help advertisers discover new and relevant customers who are coming to our site in a shopping mindset since then we’ve been building our advertising platform and from the outset maintaining an extremely high bar for the ads we show and the experiences we create we’re always striving to ensure ads meet our customers’ expectations while delivering meaningful results for our advertisers it’s still early but the advertiser response we’re seeing to date tells us it’s working recently we’re seeing positive results in integrating more video within our advertising program we’ve just started doing this both within our ad units and through a new feature we’re calling native video what role is video playing in amazon’s advertising across screens and devices utzschneider we want to create a compelling platform that includes video for example our customers like watching howto videos to help them make purchase decisions and we see that as a great opportunity for our marketers to meaningfully connect with amazon customers we launched native video in the fourth quarter of  in the us so if i’m shopping on amazon and i enter a search term—let’s say cover girl—i may see cover girl videos like how to create a smoky eye in the search results customers can watch the video learn more about the products how to use them and make a more informed shopping decision we also have the ability for customers to add the featured product to their shopping carts from right within the video we’re adding this type of short‑form video content across other categories as well like video game trailers and movie trailers what are your three biggest priorities for  utzschneider i’d say the first priority is global we’re a global platform and we focus on scale and product parity in every country we serve we’ll continue to focus on scaling our current regions and evaluating new ones right now amazon media group serves eight countries we’ll remain focused on delivering great advertising across those regions and innovating as we grow the business we also want to ensure the ad products we roll out are consistent country by country for our customers and so that our global marketers can plan and buy advertising globally the second priority is connected devices as i mentioned we run advertising on kindle ereaders kindle fire tablets and mobile tens of thousands of new customers make their firstever amazon purchase via mobile devices every day in fact people love shopping on a mobile device so much millions of amazon customers shop exclusively on a mobile device all year that’s a tremendous opportunity to connect marketers with amazon customers wherever they are and at every digital touchpoint i would say our third priority is video it’s early days for us with video but we see lots of opportunity to enhance both the customer and advertiser experience via video what are you doing with ecommerce ads utzschneider within amazon media group we’re looking to leverage the amazon platform in ways we feel are truly compelling for both our customers and advertisers our ecommerce ads are probably the purest example of that and we’ve been working on them for several years now with ecommerce ads we embed familiar amazon shopping features and functionality right within the ad unit—into iabstandard banners that includes features like buy now or add to cart digital coupons customer ratings and reviews add to wish list and that list keeps growing we’re continually iterating to both add more functionality and to learn how we can most effectively combine these different elements into a single ad unit as well as integrating video for example we have a 0x unit that runs on our thank you page and it can include a video the product’s average customer star rating and an add to cart button we’re seeing that ecommerce ads are performing on average  to  better than standard ads across key metrics why are these ads performing so much better utzschneider the more we can do to make advertising helpful for customers—whether it’s helping them discover new products accessing more product information making it super simple for them to add a product to their shopping cart or wish list—the more meaningful engagements it drives between customers and those brands for example you could come to amazon and look at an ad promoting a pantene haircare product without ever leaving that page you could watch a video of the pantene product within the ad unit you could see the customer rating or a review right within the ad unit and add the product to your shopping cart—right from the ad that’s offering our customers an easy and convenient shopping option while helping advertisers connecting with a relevant audience what new ad formats are you working on that you’re excited about utzschneider i wouldn’t say we’re focused on creating new ad formats specifically but rather on how we truly optimize the advertising experience on our sites and across devices for both customers and advertisers the fact that customers come to amazon in a shopping mindset—whether it’s to research products or make a purchase—makes us a little bit different in this space and we embrace that difference it also means we approach advertising a little differently we strive to create advertising that helps customers discover products vs just delivering impressions we want to create advertising that helps inform customers and helps advertisers connect with customers in ways that are most meaningful as they’re shopping we believe ecommerce and advertising intersect at the customer when both are optimized to help them find discover and buy so that’s where we focus we believe that’s how we can deliver the most value for our advertisers our ecommerce ads are one example of that using video in different ways is another example of how we’re looking at optimizing experiences for customers and advertisers across our platform i can’t speak to new things we may be doing in the future but i can say we’re also really focused on crossscreen formats as are our advertisers customers expect their shopping experiences across screens to be as seamless similarly marketers are looking at how to create consistent advertising experiences across devices and screens we’ve been working with many marketers to connect them with audiences across devices whether it’s a pc mobile device or kindle ereader we’re finding that marketing campaigns running on at least two screens are performing on average  better across key metrics than campaigns running on a single screen recently we ran a campaign for the dvd release of despicable me  it featured ecommerce ads and ran on amazoncom imdbcom and on the kindle fire tablet the customer could view a preroll of the movie as well as add the dvd to their shopping cart from within the ad they could do this from their pc for example and complete the purchase later on their kindle fire or mobile phone you and your team have worked with some of the world’s largest brands what do they want most from their amazon advertising experience utzschneider marketers know we have a loyal and engaged customer base of over  million active customer accounts worldwide done right the combination of that user base plus the growth of ecommerce overall is a tremendous opportunity for them we work with some of the largest global marketers and these marketers are excited to team with us to create the most meaningful engagements for amazon customers with their brands amazon prides itself on being customercentric what does this mean for the advertising business utzschneider we start with the customer and work backward just as we do with everything at amazon we aspire to create relevant and shopping experiences for our customers and better results for our advertisers by delivering useful ads that help customers discover and buy the products they’re looking for you’ve worked in digital advertising and media for a while now what keeps you excited about being in this business utzschneider you’re right i’ve worked in the digital advertising space for quite some time now at amazon we believe it’s day one it’s day one for the internet it’s day one for advertising and we’re at the tip of the iceberg in terms of figuring out ways to create relevant innovative experiences for our customers and advertisers there’s so much opportunity ahead of us to be able to connect with amazon customers from any digital touchpoint and deliver relevant and meaningful marketing experiences to them what do you and your team like best about emarketer utzschneider emarketer is a great onestop shop for the amazon media group and our sales team with emarketer the team doesn’t have to scour through a lot of data to get the precise insight that they’re looking for—they can go and quickly pull the insight and get what they need the insights and data are easy to find second it helps the team get better educated about industry trends it’s so important for a sales team to stay up to date on what’s happening in the industry

of devising how best to bolster the company’s earnings which includes working with select advertisers on pilot schemes here she speaks with the drum about her ambitions to monetise its rich repository of audience insights in just under a year since defecting from amazon to yahoo lisa utzschneider was recently promoted from vp of sales to cro and now ranks as one of the chief lieutenants of chief executive marissa mayer this involves putting into place its much feted mavens mobile video and native revenue strategy she takes up the reins at a crucial stage of transition for not just yahoo but every webbased media owner as audiences’ media consumption fragments with over 4 million visitors to its media properties on a daily basis yahoo is one of the biggest media owners in the world and has at its disposal swathes of audience data according to utzschneider she added “one of the first things i looked at when coming in was what kind of data do we have how valuable it is to marketers and how can they harness itat present utzschneider and company are in the process of thinking through what its data strategy should be “the good news is that we have lots of interesting data especially between the acquisitions of brightroll flurry and tumblr with those platforms there’s so much opportunity because we’ve been able to maintain the consumer trust of the yahoo brand with users of the three services“so right now we’re working very closely with our product team and thinking we should crawl walk and then run” she explained utzschneider claimed this involves identifying what kind of data marketers and agencies need to improve their audiences targeting and then begin experimenting with their assets in partnershipa crucial part of this strategy is helping advertisers understand how best to engage with audiences on mobile devices given that such devices are now the primary medium of webbased media consumption“one area we are really trying to crack is mobile given that we’ve acquired flurry we now have a pretty good picture of how consumers are now spending their time and what they’re doing in apps that’s an area where we’re working with marketers we’re looking at flurry data and then trying to connect that with other yahoo data” she explains in addition yahoo is also in the process of helping advertisers understand how best to synchronise their mobile advertising executions with those on desktop  an equivalent to facebook’s social graph or google’s device graph utzschneider added “the crossdevice story is something we’re still working on it’s really difficult to get that right i’m a big believer in getting two screens right first before trying to get things crossscreen so starting with the desktop and then focusing on tablets but we are starting to experiment with crossdevice capabilities” this article is about world digital advertising mediashare to twittershare to linkedinshare to facebookget the newsletterkeep up to date with the latest news
