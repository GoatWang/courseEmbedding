was separate from time warner cable most of its carriage deals were still negotiated on its behalf by time warner cable thus bright house customers were affected whenever there were carriage disputes between twc and a content provider which has happened several times bright house networks spectrum from its inception in  bright houses systems in central florida including orlando refused to carry fox sports florida this dated back to when the central florida cable franchise was held by cablevision and then time warner cable as bright house is by far the largest cable provider in central florida this left most of the orlando area without most orlando magic games the dispute ended in  when bright house added fox sports florida to its lineup on september   bright house temporarily dropped stations owned by the lin tv corporation on its pensacola defuniak springs and indiana systems affected stations were walatv in mobile alabama wishtvwndytvwiihca in indianapolis and wanetv in

companies factored in a total of  markets were affected on december   time warner cable and viacoms mtv networks had not agreed to renew any viacom channel beyond the end of year therefore time warner and bright house networks would have lost all  viacom channels including comedy central and nickelodeon starting on january   this blackout was narrowly avoided when a zerohour deal was reached shortly after  midnight et on january   in december  the fox broadcasting company announced that a dispute with time warner cable could lead to foxs owned and operated affiliates to be pulled from bright house systems in the detroit tampa bay orlando and gainesville markets along with foxs cable and sports channels in all markets served by bright house the carriage protests were announced shortly before fox was to carry the bowl championship series which included the florida gators in the sugar bowl the dispute excluded fox news channel fox business network and some regional sports channels which are on separate contracts shortly before the  midnight et deadline on december   fox granted time warner cable and bright house a brief extension during new years day as talks continued so viewers would not miss the sugar bowl though the other bowl games and the nfl lineup remained at risk a settlement between the two parties was reached the evening of january   though no terms were disclosed during the discussions that day none of foxs channels or stations were blacked out in july  abcs parent company disney announced that disney was involved in a carriage dispute with time warner cable for the first time since  because bright house networks deals are negotiated by time warner cable bright house customers were also affected in bright houseserved areas the dispute involved the disney channel disney xd abc family and all the networks of espn despite word of an early agreement on august   it was not until the evening of the september  deadline that an agreement was reached between disney and time warner cable on july   hearst television removed its stations from time warner cable and bright house networks systems when the parties failed to reach a deal in the interim wesh orlando was replaced on bright house systems in central florida with wbretv wilkesbarre pennsylvania a station owned by the nexstar broadcasting group while other hearst stations on bright house were replaced with other cable channels offered by bright house nexstar complained that bright house has used wbres signal outside their markets without permission while bright house argued it was within its rights to use that stations signal as a replacement until a deal with hearst was reached according to time warner cable the dispute stemmed from hearsts demand of a  increase in its retransmission fees the substitutions lasted until july   when the deal was reached between hearst and time warner on august   at  pm the carriage deal between cbs and time warner cable expired with no renewal deal being reached until a month later time warner had major markets affected by the blackout while only a few bright house markets lost access to cbs and cw stations owned by cbs
