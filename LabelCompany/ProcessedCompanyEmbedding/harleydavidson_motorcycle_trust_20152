fitch affirms  classes of harleydavidson motorcycle trust   business wire fitch affirms  classes of harleydavidson motorcycle trust  december    pm eastern standard time new yorkbusiness wirefitch ratings has affirmed four outstanding classes of the harleydavidson motorcycle trust  a full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release key rating drivers the rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and loss performance with cumulative net losses at  currently the collateral pool continues to perform within fitchs expectations based on the current structure and credit enhancement the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the current ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiple levels for the transaction lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage the notes exhibit a slight decline in loss coverage under a backended loss timing scenario however the probability of such a scenario is considered remote given seasoning growth and historical loss timing patterns in fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a x increase of fitchs base case loss expectation and moderate sensitivity to a x increase to date the transaction has exhibited solid performance with losses well within fitchs initial expectations in addition increasing credit enhancement levels has resulted in rising multiples as such a strong material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pools to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings use of thirdparty due diligence pursuant to sec rule g form abs due diligencee was

based on available credit enhancement and loss performance with cumulative net losses at  currently the collateral pool continues to perform within fitchs expectations based on the current structure and credit enhancement the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the current ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documentsrating sensitivitiesunanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiple levels for the transaction lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coveragethe notes exhibit a slight decline in loss coverage under a backended loss timing scenario however the probability of such a scenario is considered remote given seasoning growth and historical loss timing patternsin fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a x increase of fitchs base case loss expectation and moderate sensitivity to a x increase to date the transaction has exhibited solid performance with losses well within fitchs initial expectations in addition increasing credit enhancement levels has resulted in rising multiples as such a strong material deterioration in
