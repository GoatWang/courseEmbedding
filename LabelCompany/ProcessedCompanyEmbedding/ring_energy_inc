a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions we use the terms “estimated ultimate recovery” “eur” “probable” “possible” and “nonproven” reserves reserve “potential” or “upside” or other descriptions of volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the sec’s guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the sec reference to eur estimated ultimate recovery of natural gas and oil includes amounts that are not yet classified as proved reserves under sec definitions but that we believe will ultimately be produced these estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by us factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of our drilling program which will be directly affected by capital availability drilling and production costs commodity prices availability of services and equipment permit expirations transportation constraints regulatory approvals and other factors and actual drilling results including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates accordingly actual quantities that may be recovered from our interests will differ from our estimates and could be significantly less than our targeted recovery rate in addition our estimates may change significantly as we receive additional data           home • investors • presentations • careers •

company on a rolljul  about ring energy rei long player longshort equity value special situations contrariansummaryproduction rose  from the previous year and  over the first quarterexpect attractive production comparisons to continue management extended the rig lease to the end of the year this adds at least eight wells to the budget of irrs of more than  rival reeves county results for a small fraction of the acreage costscash flow comparisons with the previous year will remain very favorable throughout the fiscal year quarter over quarter cash flow growth will be erratic as commodity prices declinea debtfree balance sheet strong cash balance and a modest credit line give this company a lot of flexibilitydespite the lower oil prices ring energy nysemktrei may surprise investors with a pleasantly large quarterly cash flow unexpectedly large margins and sizable production increases for the year so the stock remains a strong consideration for longterm investors this stock has so far behaved rather strongly remaining near its high for the year at  the stock closed at  on july   in contrast to stocks such as permian favorite resolute energy nyseren which have swooned noticeably that could be due to the fact that resolute energy carries some debt so despite outstanding results resolute energy could use some commodity price cooperation ring energy may be a little expensive but the low production starting base allows for attractive comparisons plus the company has a far easier time waiting out periods of low prices with its debtfree balance sheet management has indicated that it will probably borrow some money this year however the final amount is expected to be very reasonable compared to the production in the meantime net production increased  over the year before and  over the first quarter of  june  average net daily production was approximately  boes as compared to net daily production of  boes in june  and net daily production of  boes in march  the average estimated price received per boe in q  was  the biggest news from this latest management update press release is that the company has extended the contract on the rig to the end of the year despite the price decline the original capital budget was due to run out in august so that means the capital budget is being meaningfully increased and activity will remain at a higherthanforecast level now the company will drill at least  wells instead of the originally projected  horizontal wells so the latest results are clearly good enough to withstand the lower oil prices or this company would release the rig and wait out the lower prices with its debtfree balance sheet management would simply deposit the checks from the sales as they come in and build cash until it feels that drilling would return a reasonable profit cash flow in the first quarter topped  million the previous years first quarter was negative but commodity prices have dropped roughly  from the first quarter to the second quarter so it is hard to tell if cash flow will increase significantly from the first quarter however the company is expected to post another quarterly profit and has a very easy comparison against last years secondquarter cash flow even so annualized cash flow of about  million for  is not unreasonable given the current enterprise value because that cash flow is currently growing very fast plus management stated that if results continue to exceed expectations the addition of a second rig is not out of question currently though management is only committed to keeping the first rig operating that commitment should provide significant growth for the foreseeable future source ring energy july  corporate presentation as shown in the first slide these wells are relatively shallow not only that but also management paid a small fraction of the prices paid for anything approaching the prime reeves county acreage this is one of the few managements with the nerve to do anything like adding the acreage cost into the irr calculation the reeves county companies have paid sometimes up to  million per drilling location that is far above what is shown on the second slide the irr shown above is comparable to many reeves county locations without that reeves county costs but that means the cash flow explosion shown on the firstquarter financial statements is likely to continue to grow shareholders will actually benefit from the great well profitability because there are no additional acreage charges to pay quarterly cash flow growth may be erratic due to the current commodity price declines but this company may have some of the lowest costs in texas when including the acreage costs and considering that attractive irr shown above only companies that got into the hot spots early would have competitive acreage costs a lot of shareholders never see the great permian well results because the skyhigh permian acreage cost was not included in the irr calculation source ring energy first quarter  earnings press release lease operating expenses are fairly attractive the costs will probably decrease as production ramps up management has both personnel and some underlying infrastructure in place for much more production so the administrative expenses will decrease as they are spread over more production the same goes for some of the lease operating expenses this management has and will continue to make accretive acquisitions so administrative expenses may run high even as they decline this is one of the few companies that posted a firstquarter profit the continuing operational success points to more profitable quarters despite the commodity price declines in fact the irrs shown above point to profitability at some very low commodity prices in the future this company has a bright future over a large range of commodity price forecasts the generous cash balance combined with a credit line that can be expanded as needed gives the company all the flexibility it needs to grow this management has a very conservative strategy regarding credit lines so credit line redeterminations and credit line increases are not the challenge for this management that it is for many in the industry the stock price remains near its highs and should continue to outperform the sector this is one of very few stocks that will be able to grow during most commodity price downturns so this stock should probably remain relatively expensive and double over the next  months that would be conservative if management decides to add a second rig the stock could well quadruple over five years the company is still exploring other lease areas that management has not yet decided how to develop source ring energy july  corporate presentation management has emphasized the central basin assets development of the delaware basin assets has been deferred until the central basin development is well underway yet for many companies the delaware basin assets are the focus in fact ring has yet to drill a noticeable quantity of horizontal wells in the delaware basin so if and when management turns its attention to that acreage
