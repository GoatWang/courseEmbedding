and efficient workshop folders »  product shares as strategy i recently became enamored of a quick way to get a large order which you can then use to bump your totals at strategic times of the year product shares often called clubs are not a new idea they have been around for years now and the secret of their staying power is that they workfor both the customer and the demonstrator heres the idea behind a product share in a nutshell problem customer wants a big ticket item they cant afford solution demo offers a payment plan how easy is that whether the item the customer wants is a single piece such as the color caddy the marker set or the big shot or a collection of all the ribbons envelopes papers or embellishments in the catalog they cant afford to do it all at once so a resourceful demo steps in and finds a way to make it possible for them to have their cake and eat it customers love this option but shares can be an amazing tool for the demonstrator providing a large order during slow months or at crucial times like when you are close to the next volume rebate level or trying to reach a big goal and feel like your current customer base is a little tapped out some product shares are run in conjunction with a club for instance the price each month includes three projects focusing on the product for which the share is about so if offering a marker share through a club you could use the many marvelous marker handout and teach several markering techniques each meeting through the four months product shares require a little bit of patience on the part of the customer and a little bit of organization on the part of the demo here are some tips to think about as you decide how and when to run your next product share first make sure you do your math add in all taxes and shipping charges to your totals before you divide them up for instance for a big shot share you wouldnt want to offer them a payment plan of  a month for four months just because the big shot costs  or you will lose money add up the whole thing then add a little for your trouble or for the club projects if offering this share through a club setting and then round it up people like nice round numbers and we are already conditioned that installment plans cost us a little extra for the convenience secondly advertise advertise advertise not everyone will be willing or able to take advantage of your share so you need to put the offer out there to as many people as possible make sure you make full use of email phone blog and flyers to get the news out third during poor economic times like this emphasize the budgeting aspect of a product share when you present the idea youre doing them a service by allowing them to pool their resources to get what they want youre also helping them stick with a budget so they dont overindulge their crafting whims theyll appreciate you even more for being a good friend and looking out for them finally to be fair to all participants require a firm commitment a short but wellworded contract explaining what is expected of both parties is a good idea and a deterrent to those who might flake out if you will be meeting in person in a club setting discuss the importance of loyalty for the duration and how vital it is to a product share at your first session product shares are an awesome way to bump your sales totals at crucial times getting you to that next volume rebate level helping you hit a goal or even just making your minimums during a rough patch youre also offering that oneofakind customer service that will build loyalty

investment strategy there are many different sharemarket investment strategies but ultimately they all aim to build wealth through share price growth or the generation of cash income before investing you should consider your investment goals and tailor your strategy to suit you should also have a clear idea of the circumstances in which you might need to change your strategy or sell shares questions to ask before investing what do you want to achieve from your investments do you want a return in the form of income or capital growth are you prepared to risk some of your capital for the opportunity to make higher returns growth or income investment strategies commonly focus on growth income or a combination of the two growth growth investing aims to achieve share prices growing at a rate higher than inflation it favours investments that are likely to see strong capital growth rather than paying dividends a growthbased strategy might suit you if you have a longterm investment horizon and are looking to build up a substantial asset base income investing for income aims to achieve shares that pay high dividends using franking credits can also increase the value of dividends an incomebased strategy might suit you if you are looking to supplement or replace an income – for example if you are approaching retirement learn about investment strategies franking credits some dividends are issued as fully or partly franked this means they carry imputation or ‘franking’ credits these credits can be used by some shareholders to achieve a tax offset or a reduction in the amount of tax to be paid if your marginal rate of tax is lower than the company tax rate you may be able to use the excess franking rebate to reduce the tax payable on other sources of income the tax implications of investing in shares may vary depending on your circumstances and you should take your own professional advice  share analysis there are many ways to analyse a companys share performance but most fall into one of the following two categories fundamental analysis looks at the business fundamentals future outlook and financial indicators of the company such as its balance

edt share loading the player a companies increase market share through innovation strengthening customer relationships smart hiring practices and acquiring competitors a companys market share is the percentage it controls of the total market for its products and services market share is calculated by measuring percentage of sales or percentage of units using the percentage of sales method if a company has  million in annual sales and the total sales for the year in its industry is  million the companys market share is  under the percentage of units method a company that sells  units annually in an industry where  million units are sold per year also has a market share of  higher market share puts companies at a competitive advantage companies with high market share often receive better prices from suppliers as their larger order volumes increase their buying power also increased market share and greater production go handinhand with the latter decreasing a companys cost to produce an individual unit due to economies of scale innovation is one method by which a company may increase market share when a firm brings to market a new technology its competitors have yet to offer consumers wishing to own the technology buy it from that company even if they previously did business with a competitor many of those consumers become loyal customers which adds to the companys market share and decreases market share for the company from which they switched by strengthening customer relationships companies protect their existing market share by preventing current customers from jumping ship when a competitor rolls out a hot new offer better still companies can grow market share using the same simple tactic as satisfied customers frequently speak of their positive experience to friends and relatives who then become new customers gaining market share via word of mouth increases a companys revenues without concomitant increases in marketing expenses companies with the highest market share in their industries almost invariably have the most skilled and dedicated employees bringing the best employees on board reduces expenses related to turnover and training and enables companies to devote more resources to focusing on their core competencies offering competitive salaries and benefits is one proven way to attract the best employees however employees in the st century also seek intangible benefits such as flexible schedules and casual work environments lastly one of the surest methods to increase market share is acquiring a competitor by doing so a company accomplishes two things it taps into the newly acquired firms existing customer base and it reduces the number of firms fighting for a slice of the same pie by one a shrewd executive whether

issue save share comment text size print pdf  buy copies view more from the november  issue explore the archive loading in recent years a growing number of business practitioners and theorists have postulated that one way for a company to increase its return is by increasing its market share and studies appear to have confirmed this relationship but the authors of this article refuse to accept the blanket inference that “more” is necessarily always going to mean “better” a large market share they point out can spell more trouble as well as more profit for a company a given project promising higher returns than others will surely entail greater risks as well given this direct link between profit and risk it behooves companies to manage their market shares with the same diligence as they would manage any other facet of their businesses this concept of managing market shares leads to some intriguing possibilities although most companies can profit by attempting to increase their market shares some may conclude that they are at or possibly beyond the point at which expected costs and risks outweigh expected gains the authors suggest various strategies that these companies might consider in attempting to manage their market shares capturing a dominant share of a market is likely to mean enjoying the highest profits of any of the companies serving that market it can also mean winning the leadership power and glory that go with such dominance but high market share can also mean headaches companies possessing it are tempting targets for actual and potential competitors consumer organizations and government agencies ibm gillette eastman kodak procter  gamble xerox general motors campbell’s cocacola kellogg and caterpillar are cases in point their market shares have been their blessing and their curse—their curse because they must make their decisions and manage their operations with much more care than do their competitors these companies cannot aggressively seek larger shares because further gains may break the dam and let the waters of antitrust action pour in in some cases these companies may even have to give up some share in order to stem the tide the company that acquires a very high market share exposes itself to a number of risks that its smaller competitors do not encounter competitors consumers and governmental authorities are more likely to take certain actions against highshare companies than against smallshare ones smaller competitors for example can direct certain types of attack against larger organizations attacks that would not work as well against companies of equal or smaller size one type of attack has been to file private antitrust suits in an attempt to demonstrate that the larger competitor has violated antitrust laws while amassing its dominant share in one of these suits a court recently ordered ibm to pay telex  million this was later reversed by an appeals court eastman kodak xerox anheuserbusch gillette and general foods are currently involved in other private antitrust actions another type of attack involves the use of comparative advertising avis bf goodrich sevenup and others have found it profitable to mention or picture the products of their large competitors in their ads and then to suggest the superiority of their own products potential competitors also present problems because they may see the company with the largest share as the only competitor stopping them from capturing a portion of the profits being earned in a particular industry clearly some large multiproduct companies have had considerable success in entering lucrative markets previously dominated by one or a few organizations procter  gamble for example has recently entered several markets potato chips tampons deodorant sprays and toilet paper with noteworthy results yet another risk is posed by consumer or publicinterest organizations a larger market share usually means greater public visibility consumer groups may choose the more visible companies as the targets of their complaints demonstrations and lawsuits campaign gm—the proxy battle to force general motors to take a number of actions believed to be in the public interest—was conducted against the largest and most visible auto manufacturer similarly soup—students opposed to unfair practices—was originally formed to fight the use of alleged deceptive practices in the advertising of campbell soup the leader in the soup industry eastman kodak first national city bank of new york and dupont are three other dominant marketshare companies that have been singled out by consumer or publicinterest organizations such attack by a consumer group can of course create ill will for the organization as well as involve it in costly litigation the high marketshare company also has to cope with antitrust initiatives taken by the government the justice department and the federal trade commission are placing a renewed emphasis on the “structural” characteristics of markets rather than wait for conclusive evidence that the conduct within an industry has been anticompetitive that is predatory or collusive these agencies have taken action primarily because noncompetitive market structures have allegedly existed recent suits have been filed against ibm xerox the eight major oil companies the four major cereal manufacturers and realemon in all of these suits the government has emphasized that these companies’ market shares are so large that their competition has virtually disappeared one might say that these companies are now being penalized for their success in any case they are all involved in expensive legal battles and they all face the prospect of being broken up or required to drastically alter their ways of doing business more high marketshare companies can expect antitrust suits when the ftc begins to exercise its newly won authority to require lineofbusiness reporting from major corporations with such attention focused on their daily operations multiproduct companies will find it harder to disguise their dominance of a particular market although they may be able to disguise its profitability through arbitrary allocations of fixed overhead congressional pressure to fight inflation through steppedup enforcement of the existing antitrust laws will also cause severe headaches for many high marketshare companies there are however two qualifications to these risks  the degree of risk depends on how the company has obtained its high market share to the extent that its success is based on continuous innovation andor lowering of costs and prices to buyers consumers and the government may feel less hostile to the company and competitors may feel less able to attack it to the extent that its success is based on using an expiring patent on bundling services or on tying up a particular channel of distribution these parties may be more inclined to attack it  the degree of risk depends on the resources of the other parties for example risk from competitors is not very great if they cannot afford to mount counteradvertising campaigns or private antitrust suits the risk of consumer and government intervention is not very great if the social milieu has changed from one of widespread business criticism to one of more traditional acceptance of business practices unfortunately there has been little discussion of either the problems of marketshare management facing the high marketshare company or of the actions it should consider much has been written about how a company should go about attaining increases in its market share but little about what it should do once it has attained a large share that is the question we shall consider here but first we shall discuss the way in which a business decides on its optimal market share determining an optimal market share most companies think and plan not only in terms of profit and sales volume but also in terms of market share they see marketshare gains as the key to longrun profitability the boston consulting group for example has proposed that in product areas characterized by a strong learning curve companies pursue market share maximization instead of current profit maximization despite this recommendation we feel that an organization’s goal should not be to maximize market share but rather to attain the optimal market share a company has attained its optimal market share in a given productmarket when a departure in either direction from the share would alter the company’s longrun profitability or risk or both in an unsatisfactory way a company finding its current share below the optimal level should plan for marketshare gains a company that is at its optimal market share should fight to maintain it and a company that has exceeded it should seek to reduce its current share how can a company determine where its optimal market share lies it must go through the following threestep procedure  estimate the relationship between market share and profitability  estimate the amount of risk associated with each share level  determine the point at which an increase in market share can no longer be expected to bring enough profit to compensate for the added risks to which the company would expose itself estimating profitability as a function of market share both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that profitability increases with market share consider the case of a company with a fixed plant size in this case its sales volume breakeven point is determined by the slopes of the cost and revenue curves beyond the breakeven point the company’s profits increase with its sales volume this may continue until output levels reach a high percentage of capacity and thereby cause direct costs to increase dramatically now consider the company that can expand its plant and market size usually this permits economies of scale in production distribution and marketing a larger company can afford better equipment or more automation that lowers unit costs it can obtain volume discounts in media advertising purchasing warehousing and freight it can attract the more lucrative customer accounts that want fuller services and it can gain distributor acceptance and cooperation at a lower cost empirical studies bear this out one of the best and most recent is the marketing science institute’s “profit impact of market strategies” pims project this study found that “the average roi for businesses with under  market share was about … on the average a difference of  percentage points in market share is accompanied by a difference of about  points in pretax roi” the pims study shows that businesses with market shares above  earn an average roi of  or three times that of those with shares under  however the pims study does not reveal whether profitability eventually turns down at very high marketshare levels the study lumps together all market shares above  therefore the behavior of roi in response to still higher market shares is undisclosed consequently a high marketshare company must itself analyze whether profitability will fall with further gains in market share for the following reasons it could drop dramatically holdout customers may be loyal to competitors so the cost of attracting them might exceed their value as new customers the needs of these customers may be unique and not worth the cost of catering to companies seeking to enlarge their share of market may have to carry extra costs of legal work public relations and lobbying to defend their larger market share against criticism and regulation when these factors begin to offset further gains in production and distribution efficiency the optimal market share has been reached estimating risk at different levels of market share a company’s risk also changes risk is high for low marketshare companies declines as market share increases and then increases again at very high share levels risk is high at low marketshare levels because a business is subject to competitive forays by stronger competitors cannot afford adequate marketing research and promotional spending and is vulnerable to sudden changes in consumer tastes or spending risk starts to fall with increased market share because an organization can engage in more market research operate better information systems recruit more experienced marketing personnel and spend more on marketing risk reaches a low point at a high share level and then may begin to increase at higher levels because of the growing probability that the government consumers and competitors will single the business out for specific attack finding the optimal level this third step calls for top management to compare the changes in profitability and risk that it expects in seeking other levels of market share starting with its current share management can analyze  the expected cost of achieving a specified higher level of market share  the expected profitability associated with that market share  the expected increase in risk the increase in longrun profitability must compensate for the cost of achieving the higher share and the higher attendant risk if not the specified higher market share is not optimal management should also examine a specified lower share level taking into consideration the cost profitability and decrease in risk at each level if a lower level of risk does not compensate for the reduced profitability which may or may not exist since prices may be higher or marketing costs lower and profitability unchanged and for transitional costs then the specified lower market share is not optimal if the company uses this technique for a number of alternative marketshare levels and cannot find one that offers a more satisfying balance of profitability and risk then it is at its optimal level marketshare management strategies thus far we have shown how a high marketshare company can locate its optimal market share we shall now discuss the various strategies a company can use either to attain or maintain this optimal share or to shift it to a higher level marketshare management strategies fall into four broad categories  share building  share maintenance  share reduction and  risk reduction share building the majority of companies that analyze their market position conclude that they are operating below their optimal market share they are not exploiting their plant fully or have not been able to build a plant at the most economical size they are not quite large enough to achieve promotional andor distributional economies and they cannot attract the strongest talent in sum they see a higher market share as promising greater profitability without commensurately greater risk—indeed often as reducing that risk sharebuilding strategies must be designed to meet several considerations—whether  the primary market is growing stable or declining  the product is homogeneous or highly differentiable  the company’s resources are high or low in relation to its competitors’ resources and  there are one or several competitors and how effective they are the most effective strategy for marketshare gain is product innovation its weak sister product imitation may be appropriate for growth in a growing market but it will probably not alter existing market shares such companies as xerox zenith control data and polaroid made their mark because they found a better product at the same time innovation is an expensive and riskladen strategy requiring a careful analysis of market needs and preferences a large investment and astute timing market segmentation may also be used to build share many dominant companies concentrate on the mass market and neglect or undersatisfy various fringe markets this mistake is illustrated by the big three american auto makers who for years sought the majority market concluding that the smallcar market segment was too small to be profitable the vacuum they created was first filled by volkswagen and then later by other european and japanese auto companies at a high profit a third strategy for building market share is distribution innovation in this instance the company finds a way to cover a market more effectively timex achieved its growth as a watch manufacturer by entering unconventional outlets like drugstores and discount stores these outlets then refused to carry additional brands of lowpriced watches leaving timex king of the mountain avon achieved its spectacular growth as a leader in cosmetics by resurrecting the old and neglected channel of doortodoor selling rather than by fighting bloody battles for space in conventional retail outlets a final strategy for share building is promotional innovation consider philip morris’s “marlboro man” or avis’s “we’re no  we try harder” a clever and distinctive campaign or promotion once established is hard to duplicate or offset at the same time however too many organizations emphasize promotional innovation when they should be searching for real product segment or distributional innovations flashy promotion has a hollow ring when unsupported by improvements in consumer value share maintenance in evaluating their market positions some companies will find that they are in fact operating at an optimal share level the cost or risk of increasing their share would cancel out any gains on the other hand a decline in their current share would reduce their profitability these companies are intent on maintaining market share such organizations find however that stabilizing their share is almost as challenging as expanding it underdog competitors are constantly chipping away at the stable company’s share they introduce new products sniff out new segments try out new forms of distribution and launch new promotions one of the most annoying and common forms of attack is price cutting the highshare company is always wrestling with the question of whether to meet price cuts and maintain its share or give up a little share and maintain its margins if the highshare company maintains its prices it loses share if it loses more than it expects it may discover that rebuilding costs more than the gains from holding prices in general the best defense for maintaining market share is a good offense—product innovation the same strategy that works so well for the underdog a dominant company must refuse to be content with the way things are it has to anticipate its own obsolescence by developing new products customer services channels of distribution and costcutting processes a second line of defense is market fortification the dominant company plugs market holes to prevent competitors from moving in this is the essence of the multibrand strategy perfected by pg pg will introduce a number of brands competing with each other the effect is to tie up scarce distribution space and lock out some of the competition a third and less attractive defense for share maintenance is a confrontation strategy here the dominant company defends its empire by initiating expensive promotional or pricecutting wars to discipline upstart competitors it may even resort to harassment—pressuring dealers and suppliers into ignoring upstarts to avoid losing the dominant company’s goodwill confrontation may work but it is undertaken at some risk and contributes less to social welfare than would more innovative responses furthermore such tactics suggest a senescence in the dominant organization share reduction some companies analyzing the profitability and risk associated with their current market share may come to the conclusion that they have overextended themselves in the overall market or in certain submarkets their large share puts them on the “hot seat” too often or includes too many marginal customers these factors can lead the company to think about how to reduce its presence in the market share reduction calls for the application of general or selective demarketing principlesdemarketing is the attempt to reduce temporarily or permanently the level of customer demand it may be directed at the market or selected market segments it calls for reversing the normal direction of marketing moves raising price cutting back advertising and promotion reducing service it may involve more extreme measures such as reducing product quality or convenience features in a period of prolonged shortages these steps may be especially necessary several high marketshare companies have apparently used demarketing to reduce their shares to less risky levels procter  gamble for example has allowed its share of the shampoo market to slip from around  to just above  in the past few years—much to the surprise of its competitors in this period the company has delayed reformulating its old brands prell and head  shoulders has tried to introduce only one new brand which was withdrawn twice from test markets and has not attempted to “buy” back its share with heavy spending on advertising and promotion it seems fair to speculate that procter  gamble’s passive response to its decline in market share is deliberate it may be motivated by a desire to avoid antitrust difficulties like those it has encountered with clorox and recently with its detergent products an example of a company that has used demarketing more selectively is kellogg in its delay in entering the natural cereal market the company may have decided to allow others to dominate this segment of the market to improve its chances of emerging from current antitrust difficulties without too many scars in the auto industry observers have long noted how general motors ford and chrysler treat american motors as a shield against antitrust attack the big companies have apparently given amc very little competition over lucrative contracts for government vehicles postal and military jeeps military trucks and so on finally the demarketing experience of realemon foods a subsidiary of borden deserves comment realemon implemented a selective demarketing strategy to avoid antitrust problems but it reversed its strategy too soon and paid a price until  realemon held about  of the reconstituted lemon juice market according to industry sources realemon at that time began to allow companies on the west coast and in the chicago area to make inroads into its share through fear of antitrust attack by  however a chicago competitor golden crown citrus corporation had captured a share that realemon considered too large realemon retaliated as a result the federal trade commission filed a complaint in  charging realemon with predatory pricing and sales tactics the lesson to be learned from realemons experience is that once a high marketshare company allows its share to fall it must be careful if it decides to reverse itself it should be said parenthetically that demarketing can be both desirable and undesirable from a social point of view to the extent that businesses selectively concentrate on those customer segments and product lines where they can market most efficiently and profitably demarketing can lead to greater effectiveness variety and competition however where they demarket in ways that discriminate against the weaker or disadvantaged segments—such as when a big supermarket chain closes down its innercity stores—the results can be unfortunate risk reduction companies concluding that their high share is dangerous may want to adopt strategies reducing the risk rather than strategies reducing the share we have stated that the optimal market share is a function of both profitability and risk and that any success in reducing the risk surrounding a high share is tantamount to optimizing that share companies can consider a number of measures to reduce the insecurity surrounding their high market share including  public relations  competitive pacification  dependence  legislation  diversification and  social responsiveness public relations it is becoming common for companies in dominant positions to spend large sums of money on advertising and other public relations efforts to improve their images in many cases such companies hope their efforts will undercut public support for legislative government agency or consumer group actions that would hurt their interests public relations strategies are used with good cause to publicize genuine efforts that serve the public interest but they are also used to cover up weak or nonexistent attempts—the case of a public utility that spent  to clean up the environment and  to publicize the action comes to mind when a company spends more on good words than good deeds it is giving its critics ammunition organizations have also used public relations and advertising to publicize their position on a controversial issue major oil companies took out expensive newspaper ads during the oil and gas shortages to defend their high profits—arguing that they were needed either to finance future energy growth or to make up for depressed profits in the past these ads probably did not convince a single skeptic and if anything made the public angrier at the thriftlessness of fullpage spreads defending oil profits some critics have called this “ecopornography” and have complained that these ads reduce government tax revenues since corporations unlike private citizens can treat the cost of political messages as a legitimate business expense competitive pacification the highshare company may attempt to reduce the risks associated with its position by cultivating better relations with its competitors there are numerous ways in which this can be done organizations may help find supplies of raw materials or even sell the material outright they may conduct advertising campaigns that promote the product category rather than their specific brands they may refrain from reacting strongly to the strategy changes of their rivals they may supply valuable research data and other assistance to smaller competitors through trade association activities they may provide price umbrellas and they may hold back the rate of new product introduction of course the company that chooses to use competitive pacification strategies must be careful to avoid behaving in what could be considered a collusive manner pacified smaller competitors exist in many industries general motors and ford have apparently recognized that it is in their best interests to keep chrysler and american motors friendly similarly the smaller cereal companies are on good terms with giant kellogg because competitive pacification strategies permit weak competitors to survive and even to prosper they provide a public service by giving consumers a wider variety of products to choose from however to the extent that these strategies lead to a misallocation of resources and higher prices they may do a disservice to the american public it should be remembered that consumers can also benefit from counteradvertising antitrust suits and other aggressive actions initiated by these same unpacified smaller competitors dependence  legislation dependency strategies forge a link between the high marketshare company and the government by making government institutions and officials dependent on it for various products particularly defenserelated commodities for help in keeping unemployment down or for political campaign funds a company can acquire considerable power over policy makers and lessen its chances of being the target of government legislation and lawsuits both the justice department and the federal trade commission have been the butt of dependency strategies in a chapter entitled “the politics of antitrust” the authors of the closed enterprise system a ralph nader venture cite numerous cases in which the justice department has been subjected to and has sometimes succumbed to pressures by elected officials to curtail antitrust actions the most noteworthy example of course is the itt case similarly the supposedly independent ftc has not found itself totally immune from pressures by elected officials since congress appropriates its budgets and the president appoints its commissioners many elected officials are willing to exert pressure on these and other enforcement agencies because they fear that they will lose campaign funds and other forms of political support defense supplies and employment opportunities for their constituencies if large powerful companies are successfully prosecuted under antitrust or other laws it is unfortunate that our antitrust laws have encouraged the use of dependency strategies the laws were originally designed to prevent this type of behavior however it is just as true that the procedures developed over the years for enforcing these laws have allowed dependency strategies some success this success has resulted in a reduction of the political influence of individual citizens and a lessening of competition in many economic sectors closely related to dependency strategies are legislative ones a high marketshare company can attempt to convince congress to pass legislation giving it special treatment under the law for example labor unions professional athletic leagues banks and newspapers have all received special treatment under the antitrust laws special legal treatment has also been offered to many companies in the form of subsidies tax loopholes and tariff reductions thus successful use of legislative strategies can practically eliminate a company’s risk of being the target of an antitrust attack andor help stabilize earnings at high levels it is difficult to say a priori whether a company’s use of legislative strategies will or will not benefit society the organization that lobbies for an antitrust exemption special tariff treatment or tax loopholes is acting in its own interest yet this does not mean that its interest will not ultimately coincide with that of the public the biggest objection to the use of legislative strategies by high marketshare companies is that it involves asking for special treatment rather than equality under the law and it shelters the company or industry from the fresh winds of competition diversification by diversifying successfully into markets that are different from the one it dominates a company can ensure that a steady stream of profits will continue even after something as drastic as an antitrust divestiture has occurred many high marketshare companies have done just this for example the brookings institution’s classic examination of the pricing practices of  major corporations including general motors general electric general foods and us steel revealed that antitrust concerns seemed to motivate several highshare companies to diversify the report states “a broader impact of the antitrust laws may be their effect on marketshare policy many of the companies interviewed expressed a preference for making their way into new markets wherein their share would be a minor fraction to dominating the market in the established product” in addition fear of competition in established markets can lead companies to diversify a more recent example of a highshare company that has diversified extensively is gillette it has expanded from shavingrelated products to deodorants pens shampoos hairdryers and other product categories the adoption of diversification strategies by dominant organizations normally has positive social benefits their movement into new industries tends to create healthy competition throughout the entire economy social responsiveness the most constructive way for a high marketshare company to reduce its risk is to demonstrate a responsiveness to emerging consumer and social needs certain companies have gained the trust of the buying public because of their continuous efforts to respond to such social needs—one thinks immediately of sears zenith and whirlpool trust is not the result of a sustained and clever public relations campaign but rather of the satisfaction that customers and the public receive in dealing with a company a high marketshare company that has successfully won the public trust is giant foods a major food chain in the washington dc area giant foods interpreted the various consumer criticisms of the late s not as presenting unwelcome problems but as offering useful new opportunities so it took the initiative and introduced such consumeroriented programs as unit pricing open dating and some nutritional labeling it also carried an extensive supply of less expensive private labels to enable consumers to hold down their costs it publicized moneysaving food buys and supported the meat boycott to bring down consumer costs and it appointed esther peterson former white house special assistant for consumer affairs as a consumer affairs advisor all of these steps made it a consumer champion and won it many friends and patrons nonetheless evidence is still needed to prove that a company assuming the role of consumer champion with all the expense this entails is compensated in terms of either market share or lower risk it seems to be a part that only one company in each industry can play meaningfully since others are typed as weak imitators however in an age of such formidable social problems as high prices environmentalism shortages antibusiness sentiment and changing lifestyles these problems should be regarded as disguised opportunities for the companies that have the courage and imagination to perceive them filling societal needs because it is exposed to a large and unique set of risks the high marketshare company is confronted with difficult problems it cannot seek an ever larger market share as freely as its smaller competitors instead it must carefully analyze the relationship of its current share to its optimal market share and it must plan how to make these two shares coincide more often than not the high marketshare organization will find that it must use sharereduction or riskreduction strategies to align these two shares unfortunately the use of many share and riskreduction strategies can have undesirable social consequences demarketing strategies of a highly discriminatory nature certain public relations strategies competitive pacification strategies dependency strategies and legislative strategies can all produce outcomes that are not in the best longterm interests of major portions of society therefore the high marketshare company should give serious consideration to those strategies that not only fill its coffers but also respond to consumer and social needs  for a detailed discussion of

strategy recently i was tasked with designing a marketing strategy for the launch of a new version of a product our main goal for the early stages of the launch was to get as many user signups as possible looking for a little inspiration i researched how other tech companies tackle user acquisition during product launches i wanted to know how do companies get users to share their products either prelaunch during beta or at the beginning of a public launch i divided my research into two main categories viral sharing tactics executed outside the tool and viral sharing tactics that exist within the tool or at least originate there like integration with major social networks incorporating features that make your product highlysharable from the getgo is key when done right these kinds of features––such as integration with preexisting wellknown tools and referral rewards––can contribute significantly to sustainable longterm growth luckily they are no longer seen as belonging solely to the domain of the engineering team the rise of growth hacking has put the ball in the technical marketer’s court but come launch time what you do outside of the tool in order to get people to share and talk about your product is also critical it can give you that little extra push you need to gain initial traction and generate buzz plus planning and executing these tactics is a lot of fun in this article i’ll examine a handful of ways in which companies get people to start sharing their product aside from features that live within the tool let’s get started  ask for shares on key landing pages  in followup emails the company upstanding––makers of an affordable ergonomic portable desk that converts any standard desk into a standing workstation––invites people to sign up for a preorder waiting list and then asks subscribers to spread the word the company keeps it simple and elegant after filling out the contact form you arrive at a landing page that invites you to share the company website in several ways on major social media channels via email or by copying a shortened link and pasting it wherever you like upstanding also sends an email to new preorder subscribers thanking them and asking for a share this is a great idea but i would tweak a couple things about the email the link takes you to the signup form for the preorder waiting list doh why would i want to go through the hassle of filling this out again just so i can promote their product instead they should link to the confirmation page where the sharing options are or to a prewritten tweet remember you want to make it as easy as possible for people to share the “please share” cta is followed directly by another cta inviting people to visit their site whenever i put a really important cta in an email especially “please share my product” i try not to take attention away from it by giving people too many other options why distract people from doing what you really want them to do––share––with something much less concrete like prompting them to return to the site for the launch that i worked on we also asked new users to share the product with their community by linking to a prewritten tweet in the welcome email the result within the first week of launch we saw about  prewritten tweets published and over  visits to the product signup page via clicks on these tweets robinhood a stock trading tool that has over k people on their waiting list yet hasn’t even launched gamifies the process of sharing their website the more friends you get to sign up for the waiting list the higher up your position on the waiting list becomes robinhood even tells you exactly how many people are ahead of you on the waiting list besides activating people’s competitive impulse seeing that hundreds of thousands of others have signed up is an effective form of social proof as sean ellis points out in his writeup of robinhood’s prelaunch promotion strategy robinhood follows up with a welcome email that reiterates the opportunity to get early access by referring friends and it provides a link to a page where you can check your position on the waiting list further prompting you to want to get ahead unrollme an application that helps you quickly unsubscribe from all those mailing lists you never even knew you signed up for asks new users to share during the initial setup process right before they get to their dashboard for the first time they give the option to publish a prewritten tweet or post about the service on facebook if you want to replicate this click to tweet offers a supereasy way to create your prewritten tweet and track the results similarly you can use pay with a tweet to require new users to tweet about your product before getting access  take advantage of milestones to inspire shares you can also take advantage of major milestones to reach out to existing users and influencers and inspire them to talk about your product ryan hoover at product hunt sent the email below to users when pandodaily published a piece about the company he then included a clicktotweet option at the end of his email inviting people to talk about your product when you’ve received recognition from a wellrespected publication or reached an important milestone such as a large number of user signups or the launch of an important new feature is a great way to get an additional boost in shares and mentions perhaps you already asked these people to share your product when they signed up for the waiting list or for the beta trial but an impressive achievement is a great excuse to ask again  get people to publicly request access or ask an influencer to gift access to their community the personal finance startup blueleaf added an interesting twist to the referafriend tactic used by many in which current users invite people from their community to sign up they turned on the ability to invite a friend for a limited time period an hour or two and during that time wannabe users scrambled to find people they knew who already had access which often led to people publicly asking for an account like in the tweet below this inspired us to try something similar for our product launch––something that gave us impressive results and didn’t involve creating or tweaking any features within the tool when accounts for our tool were still invitationonly we gave an access code to a major influencer in our space he published the code on twitter and facebook and specified that it would only be active for an hour people scrambled to sign up for the tool before the hour was up and we saw a surge in mentions about our tool in twitter the campaign resulted in over  new signups in  minutes plus many more on the waiting list  use badges to reward people with early access when noah kagan took on the position of director of marketing at mint he was tasked with getting  users within the first six months of launching kagan admits to being a bit nervous at first but by the end of six months the fledgling personal finance application had over  million users mint’s success can be credited to a variety of things including building a truly excellent product kagan’s quantbased marketing plan and press mentions in the right places one way that kagan got people to broadcast mint to their communities was through badges the badges were actually a solution to the system’s inability to handle the k people on the waiting list mint told users that they could have special access to the tool if they placed the badge on their blog in fact mint continues to offer the badges for personalfinance enthusiasts check them out here kagan points out that xobni the email productivity company recently acquired by yahoo also rewarded people who placed badges on their websites and blogs with early access to their beta xobni attached a referral number to each badge click to determine which blogs had audiences interested in their product allowing the company to collect data that would help target its marketing efforts later on there are many ways to generate buzz around a new product you’ll want to test different approaches to see what works for you more importantly think about how you can combine the tactics discussed above and put your own spin on them in order to create your unique recipe for viral growth as nate desmond points out on his blog during the early stages of user acquisition the goal is to “throw things at the wall and see what sticks” but you don’t want to throw in the dark so make sure you get to know your customer before planning your launch strategy creating buyer personas is an excellent exercise that will spark ideas about how to tailor your launch to your audience now i’d like to hear from you what are the most

criticalbefore consumers could try the product however it was important for any product to gain the support of its trade customers retailers needed to view it as accommodating in urging clients to visit their shops in the event that the item had neglected to premium retailers and wholesalers the expenses of venture would not have been met and they would not have supplied the item reply neil patel may   at  am rupal great points i believe getting off on the right foot is essential for any long term strategy reply heidi pungartnik may   at  am cool ideas but wouldn’t share buttons on

on it being an interesting point and more applicable than just the way it’s mentioned here  in thinking through the social sharing strategy for our product launch we’re not only thinking about milestones that we as a company reach that we could share with our users but also the milestones our users reach while in the app that they might benefit from sharing with their network canva does a nice job of sending out milestones for this sort of thing when you reach x of designs you get a badge for it and they send an email the graphics for which were designed in canva no doubt to the user

companies have a product management department serving as the “voice of the customer” and helping to better understand market needs this function typically generates an extensive roadmap of new products and enhancements but is product management really being used strategically for example what is the product strategy that is driving roadmap priorities and how is the product strategy linked to the company’s overall strategy since most technology companies’ revenues come primarily from their products or services you would think that the product strategy would be carefully crafted with the close scrutiny of the executive team and that it would be meticulously aligned with an overarching corporate strategy but this is often not the case without the engagement of the leadership team most responsible and presumably most qualified for determining strategy and direction the risk is suboptimal financial performance at best and complete company failure at worst let’s take a look at some practical approaches to making product management more strategic by engaging executives in key product strategy decisions and encouraging better corporate strategic planning the strategic product plan the essential goal of a product plan should be to ensure that a product is built that delivers some business value to a specific set of customers in order to meet certain financial goals based upon a defined corporate strategy successive plans should increase that product’s effectiveness in doing so a product plan describes the market opportunity profiles the target customers specifies pricing identifies the financial goals indicates the key priorities for development and enhancement and provides a roadmap for delivery for at least the next four quarters for a new product a comprehensive mrd market requirements document might well serve as the product planbut each product that continues to be offered to customers should have a product plan updated every year so how does product management create a good product plan let’s assume that the product management department is already managing several products that are currently serving customers after getting feedback from customers speaking with the sales teams obtaining a list of the top technical support issues surveying competitor positions and features and receiving new ideas from development the product management team has generated a list of possibly hundreds of potential product enhancements across the product line as well as some new product ideas project prioritization typically takes place next due to limited development resources many companies apply some arbitrary prioritization scheme based upon the perceived number of times the featureproduct has been requested or how much revenue they think the feature can generate the product manager or his development friends may also make assumptions about value based upon how they think the product should be used the product management team then creates a roadmap and a release schedule based upon these priorities and voila the product plan is done right no it certainly is not the product plan is not complete because the company’s strategy has not yet been considered the executives who are chartered with running the company have not had an influence on the product plan the plan is merely a reaction to a somewhat random set of market facts and eventsso how exactly does the corporate strategy relate to the roadmap well the goal of almost any technology company is to increase revenues without a strategy to indicate how the company plans to increase revenue then just about any product plan could arguably help the company achieve its goal including the plan we just created but with a strategy that specified how new revenue will be generated a product plan tailored to supporting that strategy can then be developed for example your company could plan to grow revenue by selling its flagship product into new geographic regions your company could plan to grow by establishing a new reseller channel your company could  grow by enhancing its existing products to appeal to a wider base of customers your company could plan to grow by developing new products that appeal to the existing customer base each of these decisions carries with it significant implications on the product plan selling into new geographic regions would require local language support and may have other specific regional requirements selling through a reseller channel may require multitier administration and brandingenhancing products to appeal to a wider customer base requires profiling that new customer and understanding hisher unique needs and requirements and developing new products requires new analysis requirements design and development work thus each of these strategies would result in a different prioritization of the projects on the product manager’s candidate list and a different allocation of resources the product plan we created previously is reactionary and haphazard while the product plan that responds to corporate strategy is directed and intentional so why aren’t corporate strategies incorporated into product plans there are several possible reasons but three of the most prevalent ones i have come across are  no strategy exists  the strategy has not been clearly communicated or  the strategy appears inconsistent with market and customer data let’s analyze each in the following sections and propose some ways to solve them if no strategy exists then one should be created at one internet services company the executive team employed a process where they reviewed and prioritized the top project requests every six weeks this approach resulted in constantly shifting priorities since the highest priority projects were always related to the biggest sales opportunities at the time less critical product features never made the cut resulting in a product line that became increasingly uncompetitive without a driving strategy behind it your company risks being jacked around by shortterm opportunities product management is in a good position to persuade executives to develop a high level strategy as part of the product planning processhere are some key questions that product managers can ask executives to help with product planning that might very well stimulate some strategic discussions what are the top  most critical challenges our company will address this year in which geographic regions will we focus on selling our products will there be any changes to the sales or channel strategy what are the revenue and profitability expectations for each product line will there be any changes to the focus of marketing and advertising are new markets or product lines being considered for the future what strategic partnerships are on the horizon what resource changes are expected for the coming year now an astute executive may ask the product management team to answer or help answer many of these questions and that makes some sense since product management sees market opportunities has heard customer feedback first hand and has aggregated it from others has tracked competitor’s moves and has an indepth view of their products’ financial trends but at the same time you still want to leverage the knowledge and experience of the executive team and make sure they agree with the assumptions and logic being used therefore a practical approach to strategic planning could involve a meeting or series of meetings where product management presents their market and customer information to executives who then have a chance to discuss what they have heard and how they think it should apply to the future of the company you could expand the discussion to include input from other functions like sales marketing and finance so that everyone is hearing key information that will lay the groundwork for the strategy in a subsequent meeting product management can replay the conclusions and decisions from the previous discussions and then present a proposed product strategy that responds to them hopefully by then a consensus on the strategy will be reached and the product management team with the assistance of development can then present an updated roadmap and proposed release schedule for the coming quarters for final review and approval the second reason why corporate strategies are not incorporated into product plans is that product managers don’t know about them or don’t understand them it is certainly possible that an executive team will define a company strategy and then will succinctly describe that strategy in a form that can be handed down to all employees for successful execution more typically however the executive team communicates the strategy to their teams in a less formal fashion atone midsized software company the executives felt that the strategy was too sensitive to share broadly and tried to share it on a “needtoknow” basis only most of their own employees were therefore in the dark about how to successfully execute the strategy the product management team is a key executor of the strategy the will translate corporate strategy into product strategy and will create roadmaps that drive the work of many of the company’s employees for product managers to thoroughly understand the corporate strategy is to significantly improve the odds of its successful execution thus i would highly recommend that the entire executive team present the strategy directly to the product management team this will facilitate the necessary dialogue and allow for a joint understanding of the implications to the product strategy product management should then be required to develop a product strategy and proposed roadmap and present back to the executive team to close the loop and ensure alignment with the corporate strategy the third reason why a corporate strategy may not be adequately incorporated into product plans is that the strategy itself appears to be inconsistent or contradict market and customer data heard by product managers this is a likely result if the executive team developed their strategy without being adequately in touch with the market and customers if the product management team is being utilized appropriately then they will be serving as the “headlights” of the company driving the frontend of the product development process and thus they will be spending the majority of their time discovering market opportunities customer needs technology trends and competitor positions now executives should always make it a part of their jobs to speak with customers and to review market trends but to ensure they hear the wealth of available market and customer information it should be considered a prerequisite to developing the corporate strategy to have the product management team present a review of what they have learned you may have noticed that in all three of the cases where corporate strategies are not adequately integrated into product plans we found that the solution was direct communications between product management and the executive team product management can help to educate senior executives with their market and customer knowledge can help mold the strategy and must also hear it firsthand so that they can properly execute it however there are reasons why this direct communication does not occur it is quite common for the product management team to report to a vp of marketing or a vp of product development who represents them at seniorlevel meetings these are broad functions with many responsibilities marketing executives are often measured and rewarded on driving revenue with sales for the company product development executives are expected to deliver quality products on schedule now i am admittedly oversimplifying here as many good executives will make decisions with a big picture perspective on business priorities beyond their direct responsibilities but there are some general tendencies based upon shortterm rewards and there are limits to a person’s time and attention so when sitting at the strategy planning table what types of things are they most concerned with how well do they understand customer needs and market opportunities is profitability one of their primary concerns are they concerned with shortterm or longterm issues in other words will they be good representatives of the market and will they push to defend the bottomline this brings us to a broader issue at many technology companies who is actually concerned with profitability and the balancing short and longterm goals who is ensuring that every key decision is being made with key business goals in mind in short who is minding the store for most functionallyaligned technology companies comprised of sales marketing operationssupport development and finance the lowest level of management where accountability exists for profitability and longterm strategic issues is amazingly the coo if one exists or the ceo if not think about it the sales organization is primarily concerned with revenue and tends to be shortterm focused marketing typically supports sales objectives operations and support keep the services running well maintain customer satisfaction and are primarily cost centers development focuses on delivering quality products on schedule and is also managed as an expense finance tracks revenues and costs but is in a limited position to influence them so who is thinking about profitability and achieving longterm goals if it is nobody other than the ceo or coo then there is a real danger that the myriad of decisions made every day by managers across the company will not be made with the right focus one increasingly popular solution i am seeing employed is to elevate the role of the product management function given its critical strategic responsibilities and have it report directly to the coo or ceo or for larger companies the relevant businessaccountable executive this makes product management a direct member of the leadership team making strategic decisions about the business this product management function will be chartered with providing market intelligence to inform the executive team managing product profitability and determining and driving product strategy consistent with corporate strategy this function becomes a resource for the ceocoobusiness leader to explore and manage longterm opportunities it is the function that has pl responsibility and will drive business decisions deeper into the organization it is a function that gives business leaders greater control over the plans that drive so many of the resources of the company the roadmaps and product plans since product management is in such an influential position to execute the strategy and needs to work with so many of the other functional organizations during product development and delivery it may be desirable to include other crossfunctional delivery teams in this function as well for example project managers and business analysts some companies create a “products” organization reporting tot he ceocoo that has a general manager heading up each major product line with product management product marketing business analysts and project management reporting into it in one case i have seen a large enterprise software company initially had their product management department report into the product development organization when they felt they weren’t being market focused enough they moved it under marketing when product requirements appeared to be chasing shortterm sales opportunities they eventually settled on an independent products organization such as the one just described one cautionary note it may be tempting to use this new organization to manage all issues related to the product and to stuff it with too many related functions care must be applied to keep it motivated to improve pl and stay market focused it would be tempting to say that if there is a quality problem give it to the products organization to fix if revenue is slipping below its goals have the products organization investigate if a big customer is having a problem give it to the products group to handle in a product company most issues are product issues having the products organization handle all of them will create a bottleneck and will divert resources away from its primary job to be the eyes and ears of the company to the market the other functions of the company are accountable for issues such as product quality development revenue sales and marketing and customer issues support so let them handle it the strategic planning process so let’s step back and take a look at what an endtoend product planning cycle might look like when integrated with the company’s strategic planning cycle assuming that a company resets its corporate strategy financial plans and product plans once per year the planning process would ideally occur during the rd and th quarters of the fiscal year in preparation for the upcoming year the five basic steps in the planning process as depicted in figure  are market review financial review corporate strategy product strategy product roadmap and release schedules during the first step product management presents a market review to executive management sharing facts on market trends and opportunities key customer needs and competitor moves and positionsthough product management will keep tabs throughout the year on many of these items this is the opportunity to update the information to make sure it is complete and current other functions may be invited to provide their perspectives on the market and customers as well during the financial review phase the finance organization presents results on the financial performance for the company overall for its sales channels and for its products providing revenue and profitability by product is critical to making good product decisions and developing effective strategies the next step is where the company’s executive team outlines its corporate strategy in terms of its vision financial goals and its plan for achieving those goals the corporate strategy should be explicitly presented to the product management team to facilitate development of a product strategy for some smaller businesses steps  and  may be combined into a single step during step  product management develops its product strategy considering market dynamics customer needs financial goals and corporate strategy it specifies what changes to the products are needed and indicates the financial plan for each product area the product strategy should be reviewed by the executive team to ensure alignment with the corporate strategy before proceeding to the next step the final step involves the development of a product roadmap and more detailed release plans for the coming quarters consistent with the product strategy this roadmap becomes the official “product plan of record” and should be managed with formal change control proceduresthis step is executed at the conclusion of the annual planning cycle and is repeated every  or  months to allow responses to changing market conditions and deployment schedules and should be reapproved by executive management conclusion for a product or services technology company the success of the company is determined by the success of its products effective product plans address market and customer needs and support the company’s growth strategy creating effective product plans can only be accomplished with strong communications between the product management team and the executive team because product management has critical market information that executives need to develop effective strategies product management can help develop strategies by asking key questions and discussing product implications and product management must clearly understand the company’s objectives and direction in order to create product strategies and roadmaps that will help them to be achieved by leveraging the product management team as a strategic
