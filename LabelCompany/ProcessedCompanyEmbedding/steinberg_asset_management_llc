gives partners a guaranteed portion in the profits of the firm on an annual basis         copyright   steinberg asset management llc all rights reserved legal information privacy policy steinberg asset management llc         investment process sam’s research process is designed to uncover investments with extraordinary or asymmetric riskreward profiles ie steinberg stocks  fundamental analysis is sam’s primary research tool in selecting securities  sam’s process is focused on understanding the key revenue drivers margin profile and financial posture of a company’s businesses beyond typical company reporting and sellside analysis and identifying the primary sources of earnings and positive free cash flows  this method of analysis allows sam’s analysts to better understand businesses and engage in a far more robust and involved conversation with management teams  the following evaluations are integral to every analysis  business evaluation communication with management risk  reward invest in the understandable three to fiveyear strategic investment horizon identify free calls establish a target entry price     when used by sam in describing its investment philosophy “free call” refers to a future event or transaction that may or may not occur the value of which is not reflected in a company’s share price  for example it could be the potential appreciation of intellectual property or increased demand for a product  this event or transaction when realized serves as a longterm catalyst for the share price and will in sam’s estimation add value to the company that will be reflected in a higher share price as the market recognizes this  sam is not implying that an investor receives securities or options in securities for no cost by use of the term “free call”
