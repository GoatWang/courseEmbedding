less after purchase mortgage send feedback loan servicing call   ‐ home rates  fees apply now video testimonials realtors home value home search consumer portal rates fees  our  guarantee we dont charge any lender fees because you shouldnt have to pay to get a mortgage the only fee you would ever pay to rp funding is rate discount costs and only if you decide you want to buydown to an even lower interest rate many clients will use the money they would have spent on fees with other lenders and use it to buydown to an even lower interest rate your credit manager can discuss all of these options with you and help you make the best decision how do we offer the best mortgage rates in florida we get asked this question often it really comes down to business philosophy most mortgage loan officers and brokers only close    loans per month so to make a living they need to make thousands of dollars in commissions on each loan they close these commissions are earned through a combination of charging upfront fees and higher interest rates to earn kick backs not at rp funding our loan officers are paid a base  bonus and they close    loans each month so instead of paying thousands of dollars in commissions on each loan we only pay hundreds of dollars in salaries  and we pass this savings onto you in the form of the best mortgage rates possible and no lender fees now you may be worried that you wont get as good of service from a loan officer who closes    times the industry average but this isnt true read more about why rp funding service is fast and great here we have found that    closings per month per credit manager is the optimal number to keep our costs and rates the lowest without sacrificing customer service our efficiency helps us offer the lowest rates while other companies waste time and money shipping files all over the country we do everything locally you can read more about the differences this makes here shopping for a mortgage can be hard work and confusing because of the numerous combinations of mortgage rates and fees and loan programs we set our mortgage rates low to make your decision easy when you can get floridas best mortgage rates and fees from a local direct mortgage lender why would you go anywhere else click here  get started today  guarantee while we are confident that our published rates and no lender fees are the most competitive in the industry we do find rare instances where a competitor offers a better deal our promise to you at rp funding is that we will never let rates or fees stand in the way of you being able to work with your local direct mortgage lender and take advantage of all the other benefits we offer if you receive a legitimate offer from a competitor that is lower our promise to you is that we will match it and if we cant we will give you  unfortunately we have found in most cases when a competitor does offer a lower rate it is part of a bait and switch some unscrupulous companies will quote you anything over the phone and then when it comes time to give you the real figures usually after you have spent your hard earned money on an appraisal the deal suddenly changes with rp funding you can get the best deal on a florida mortgage and avoid any bait and switch or games in most cases the client came back to us when the bait and switch occurred or in some cases they were too far into the process and were stuck with a higher rate and fees because the bait and switch happened so far in the process they could not back out so beware when dealing with some unknown voice on the phone if they do make a better offer than rp funding send us a copy and we will do our best to beat it if we cant beat it well give you  when you actually close on their mortgage as disclosed  but from our experience when we cant match it its just too good to be true come down to our office you can see that we are real people and a legitimate operation unfortunately the mortgage crises happened for a reason and some of the people involved are still in our industry there are mortgage companies out there taking advantage of borrowers working from home and ready to shut down and reopen under a new name when things start to catch up with them our  guarantee allows you to work with a local reputable company that cares about this community without missing out on the best possible deal as your local direct mortgage lender our reputation in this community is important while other discount lenders may hit you with hidden fees and other last minute surprises not at rp funding rules and
