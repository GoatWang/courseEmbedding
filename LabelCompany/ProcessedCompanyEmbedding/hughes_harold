his wife had a daughter in  and shortly afterward hughes was drafted he served in the us army fighting in the north african campaign and was courtmartialed for assaulting an officer the trial resulted in his being sent to fight in sicily in  he became ill and another soldier took his place on a landing craft at anzio the craft exploded killing his replacement and many others hughes interest in politics was stirred by involvement in the trucking industry he became a manager of a local trucking business and then began organizing independent truckers he started the iowa better trucking bureau and was eventually elected to the state commerce commission which he served from – including a term as its chairman early yearsedit in  after years as an alcoholic hughes attempted suicide he described in his book how he climbed into a bathtub to make the mess easier to clean up with a shotgun and was ready to pull the trigger when he cried out to god for help he had a spiritual experience that changed the course of his life he began to pray and study the bible diligently and he even considered a career in the ministry he also embraced the alcoholics anonymous program of recovery and started an aa group in ida grove iowa in   gubernatorial campaignedit hughes grew up a republican in a heavily republican area but was persuaded to switch parties his service on the state commerce commission also brought him in contact with the interstate commerce commission and national politics he then ran for governor of iowa on the democratic ticket and defeated incumbent republican norman erbe in  a major issue in the campaign was legalization of liquorbythedrink iowa allowed only beer to be consumed over the bar liquor and wine could be purchased only in state liquor stores and private clubs hughes became a proponent of liquorbythedrink a short time after he was elected the state adopted a new system of alcohol control governor of iowaedit hughes served as governor from  to  during this time he continued to reach out as a christian and an alcoholic in recovery to people still suffering he established a treatment program in the state and was an effective spokesman for a more enlightened view of the role of alcohol in society the new treatment program was viewed as an alternative to the state mental hospitals hughes wrote that the goal was to reach alcoholics before they reach rock bottom his political career also continued to gain strength he made a speech seconding the nomination of lyndon b johnson at the  democratic convention a decision he would eventually regret and gained national recognition as a liberal governor as well as a promising national figure in the democratic party trade missions abroad and a tour of vietnam with other governors provided him with foreign policy experience in his  bid for reelection as governor hughess opponent evan hultman called attention to hughess brief relapse into alcoholism in  in a debate hultman charged that hughes’s failure to acknowledge the relapse publicly showed that hughes lacked integrity hughes responded i am an alcoholic and will be until the day i die but with god’s help i’ll never touch a drop of alcohol again now can we talk about the issues of this campaign according to the des moines register the reaction of the crowd was immediate and nearly unanimous later the register editorialized in our opinion any man or woman who wins that battle and successfully puts the pieces of his or her life back together again deserves commendation not censure hughes won by a landslide in  iowa like other states experienced democratic losses but hughes survived it was at that time that his friendship with robert kennedy started and it was kennedy who encouraged him to run for a senate seat the next years were difficult in the wake of the assassinations of kennedy and dr martin luther king racial unrest in iowa and his increasing disappointment with american policy in vietnam and the leadership of the johnson administration us senator from iowaedit  campaignedit at the  democratic national convention hughes was giving a nominating speech for antiwar candidate eugene mccarthy when violent demonstrations erupted on the streets of chicago hughes a heavy favorite defeated republican david stanley a muscatine iowa state senator by only  votes for the us senate seat being vacated by republican bourke hickenlooper of cedar rapids leader on alcoholism and narcotics addictionedit as a us senator hughes persuaded the chairman of the senate’s labor and public welfare committee to establish a special subcommittee on alcoholism and narcotics chaired by hughes himself this subcommittee which gave unprecedented attention to the subject held public hearings on july –  a number of people in recovery testified including academy awardwinning actress mercedes mccambridge national council on alcoholism founder marty mann and aa cofounder bill w in his autobiography the man from ida grove a senators personal story hughes writes that he asked a dozen other wellknown people in recovery to present public testimony but all declined the hearings were considered by some in aa a threat to anonymity and sobriety hughes also talked about the need for treatment of drug addiction he stated that treatment is virtually nonexistent because addiction is not recognized as an illness the hearings and subsequent events related to alcoholism and addiction were not given much press attention because the press was more interested in the vietnam war poverty and other critical issues legislation creating the national institute on drug abuse was not passed until  the goal of the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of  considered a major milestone in the nation’s efforts to deal with alcohol abuse and alcoholism was to help millions of alcoholics recover and save thousands of lives on highways reduce crime decrease the welfare rolls and cut down the appalling economic waste from alcoholism touted as a presidential dark horseedit in early  hughes began to get press recognition as a dark horse candidate for the  presidential election columnist david broder described him as a very dark horse but the only democrat around who excites the kind of personal enthusiasm the kennedys used to generate in  hughes denounced nixons secret wiretapping done through the fbi he seemed to observers to be an almost reluctant candidate though and a bit too much of a mystic for the washington press corps columnist mary mcgrory wrote of him he hates small talk he likes a heavy rap he talks about religion and about drugs and alcohol he hated being trotted out to cajole financiers wanting to look him over before opening the checkbook his staff had to prod him to call party chairmen hughes preferred a session with the kids at the local treatment centers the washington establishment was not too surprised when he dropped out of the race according to hunter s thompson gary hart suggested after the  campaign that hughes might have been the only democratic candidate who could have defeated nixon decision not to seek reelectionedit they were surprised though when he called a press conference on september   and announced that after a long period of soulsearching he would retire from the senate when his term was completed he said that for profoundly personal religious reasons he would seek a new kind of challenge and spiritual opportunity and would continue efforts in alcoholism and drug treatment fields working for social causes and world peace he said rightly or wrongly i believe that i can move more people through a spiritual approach more effectively than i have been able to achieve through the political approach in  his last full year in the senate he succeeded in passing legislation that extended and expanded the original  act he was invited to the signing of the bill by president nixon but couldn’t bring myself to attend since his administration had fought it every inch of the way democratic congressman john culver defeated stanley to succeed hughes in  postsenate years and retirementedit after he left the senate hughes devoted himself to lay religious work for two foundations based in washington and also founded a religious retreat in maryland he had been active in prayer groups while serving in the senate and the last few chapters of his autobiography gave this aspect of his life special prominence hughes partnered with former nixon aide charles colson in his religious work and even portrayed himself in the  motion picture born again starring dean jones as colson he also remained a strong advocate for services to chemically dependent people after his retirement hughes served as a consultant to the senate and the senate judiciary committee for a year he then started the harold hughes foundation and opened the harold hughes center to combat alcoholism after some time in iowa hughes considered running for governor in  but did not hughes moved to a retirement community in glendale arizona where he died his remains were returned to iowa and buried in the ida grove cemetery in ida grove iowa see alsoedit

puts the pieces of his or her life back together again deserves commendation not censure hughes won by a landslide in  iowa like other states experienced democratic losses but hughes survived it was at that time that his friendship with robert kennedy started and it was kennedy who encouraged him to run for a senate seat the next years were difficult in the wake of the assassinations of kennedy

a dozen other wellknown people in recovery to present public testimony but all declined the hearings were considered by some in aa a threat to anonymity and sobriety hughes also talked about the need for treatment of drug addiction he stated that treatment is virtually nonexistent because addiction is not recognized as an illness the hearings and subsequent events related to alcoholism and addiction were not given much press attention because the press was more interested in the vietnam war poverty and other critical issues legislation creating the national institute on drug abuse was not passed until  the goal of the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of  considered a major milestone in the nation’s efforts to deal with alcohol abuse and alcoholism was to help
