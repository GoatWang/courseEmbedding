pursuant to the programs set forth above we sometimes refer to series j as the balanced series risk factors an investment in series j units of the trust is speculative and involves a high degree of risk   •   the trust and series j have a limited operating history therefore a potential investor has only a limited performance history to serve as a factor for evaluating an investment in the trust and series j   •   the managing owner may select and allocate series j’s assets to new trading advisors or different programs of the advisors at any time it is expected that series j will at all times maintain an equal exposure rebalanced quarterly to each of the trading advisors who from time to time are responsible for managing the assets of series j and making the trading decisions in respect of series j’s assets however the managing owner is under no obligation to cause series j to maintain such proportional exposures or quarterly rebalancing unitholders of the trust are fully dependent upon

departed from its program or stated trading methodology or has exceeded its stated risk parameters the managing owner on behalf of the trust will take such actions as it deems appropriate which may include terminating such advisor similarly if the managing owner’s ongoing due diligence leads the managing owner to determine that it is in the best interests of the trust to terminate an advisor it

includes the principal risk that you will face with an investment in series j      you should not rely on past performance in deciding whether to buy units each advisor selected by the managing owner to manage the assets of series j has a performance history through the date of its selection you must consider however the uncertain significance of past performance and you should not rely on the advisors’ or the managing owner’s records to date for predictive purposes you should not assume that any advisor’s future trading decisions will create profit avoid substantial losses or result in performance for series j that is comparable to that advisor’s or to the managing owner’s past performance in fact as a significant amount of academic study has shown futures funds more frequently than not underperform the past performance records included in their prospectuses because you and other investors will acquire exchange and redeem units at different times you may experience a loss on your units even though series j as a whole is profitable and even though other investors in series j experience a profit the past performance of series j may not be representative of your investment experience in it the assets of series j are     •   segregated from the assets of other series if any and     •   valued and accounted for separately from any other series consequently the past performance of series j has no bearing on the past performance of any other series the trust has a limited operating history upon which to evaluate your investment in series j although past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results if the trust had a material amount of performance history such performance history might provide you with more information on which to evaluate an investment in the trust because the trust has no material performance history you will have to make your decision to invest in series j without such information      price volatility may possibly cause the total loss of your investment futures and forward contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes consequently you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in a series of the trust      speculative and volatile markets combined with highly leveraged trading may cause the trust to incur substantial losses the markets in which series j trades are speculative highly leveraged and involve a high degree of risk each advisor’s trading considered individually involves a significant risk of incurring large losses and there can be no assurance that series j will not incur such losses futures and forward prices are volatile volatility increases risk particularly when trading with leverage trading on a highly leveraged basis as does series j even in stable markets involves risk doing so in volatile markets necessarily involves a substantial risk of sudden significant losses due to such leverage even a small movement in price could cause large losses for the trust market volatility will increase the potential for large losses market volatility and leverage mean that series j could incur substantial losses potentially impairing its equity base and ability to achieve its longterm profit objectives even if favorable market conditions subsequently develop in addition to the leveraged trading described above the managing owner has the ability to further increase the leverage of series j by allocating notional equity to one or more of its advisors in a maximum amount of up to  of series j’s net asset value which would then permit such advisors to trade the account of series j as if more equity were committed to such accounts than is in fact the case although the managing owner has the option to allocate additional notional equity to an advisor the managing owner has no current plans to do so      fees and commissions are charged regardless of profitability and may result in depletion of trust assets series j is subject to the fees and expenses described herein which are payable irrespective of profitability in addition to performance fees which    table of contents are payable to each advisor based on such advisor’s profitability and not on the profitability of series j as a whole such fees and expenses include assetbased fees of up to  per annum for class i unitholders and up to  per annum for class ii unitholders as well as incentive fees equal to  of net profits on a cumulative high water mark basis included in these charges are brokerage fees and operating expenses on series j’s forward trading “bidask” spreads are incorporated into the pricing of series j’s forward contracts by its counterparties in addition to the brokerage fees paid by series j it is not possible to quantify the “bidask” spreads paid by series j because series j cannot determine the profit its counterparty is making on the forward trades into which it enters consequently the expenses of series j could over time result in significant losses to your investment therein you may never achieve profits significant or otherwise      market conditions may impair profitability the trading systems used by certain advisors are technical trendfollowing methods the profitability of trading under these systems depends on among other things the occurrence of significant price trends which are sustained movements up or down in futures and forward prices such trends may not develop there have been periods in the past without price trends the likelihood of the units being profitable could be materially diminished during periods when events external to the markets themselves have an important impact on prices during such periods advisors’ historic price analysis could establish positions on the wrong side of the price movements caused by such events graham and eagle employ technical programs      discretionary trading strategies may incur substantial losses discretionary traders while they may utilize market charts computer programs and compilations of quantifiable fundamental information to assist them in making trading decisions make such decisions on the basis of their own judgment and “trading instinct” not on the basis of trading signals generated by any program or model such traders may be more prone to subjective judgments that may have greater potentially adverse effects on their performance than systematic traders which emphasize eliminating the effects of “emotionalism” on their trading reliance on trading judgment may over time produce less consistent trading results than implementing a systematic approach discretionary traders like trendfollowing traders are unlikely to be profitable unless major price movements occur discretionary traders are highly unpredictable and can incur substantial losses even in apparently favorable markets as of the date of this prospectus none of the advisors are employing discretionary strategies on behalf of series j although each advisor reserves the right to make discretionary decisions      systematic trading strategies may incur substantial losses a systematic trader will generally rely to some degree on judgmental decisions concerning for example what markets to follow and commodities to trade when to liquidate a position in a contract which is about to expire and how large a position to take in a particular commodity although these judgmental decisions may have a substantial effect on a systematic trader’s performance such trader’s primary reliance is on trading programs or models that generate trading signals the systems utilized to generate trading signals are changed from time to time although generally infrequently but the trading instructions generated by the systems being used are followed without significant additional analysis or interpretation therefore systematic trading may incur substantial losses by failing to capitalize on market trends that their systems would otherwise have exploited by applying their generally mechanical trading systems by judgmental decisions of employees furthermore any trading system or trader may suffer substantial losses by misjudging the market systematic traders tend to rely on computerized programs and some consider the prospect of disciplined trading which largely removes the emotion of the individual trader from the trading process advantageous due to their reliance upon computers systematic traders are generally able to incorporate a significant amount of data into a particular trading decision however when fundamental factors dominate the market trading systems may suffer rapid and severe losses due to their inability to respond to such factors until such factors have had a sufficient effect on the market to create a trend of enough magnitude to generate a reversal of trading signals by which time a precipitous price change may already be in progress preventing liquidation at anything but substantial losses the programs utilized by graham eagle and ortus are systematic trading strategies    table of contents    decisions based upon fundamental analysis may not result in profitable trading traders that utilize fundamental trading strategies attempt to examine factors external to the trading market that affect the supply and demand for a particular futures and forward contracts in order to predict future prices such analysis may not result in profitable trading because the analyst may not have knowledge of all factors affecting supply and demand prices may often be affected by unrelated factors and purely fundamental analysis may not enable the trader to determine quickly that previous trading decisions were incorrect in addition because of the breadth of fundamental data that exists a fundamental trader may not be able to follow developments in all such data but instead may specialize in analyzing a narrow set of data requiring trading in fewer markets consequently a fundamental trader may have less flexibility in adverse markets to trade other futures and forward markets than traders that do not limit the number of markets traded as a result of a specialized focus ortus utilizes trading strategies that incorporate fundamental data on behalf of its program      increase in assets under management may affect trading decisions many of the advisors’ current equity under management is at or near its alltime high as of february   graham eagle and ortus each managed approximately  billion  billion and  billion respectively graham and ortus are near their all time high with respect to assets under management the more equity an advisor manages the more difficult it may be for that advisor to trade profitably because of the difficulty of trading larger positions without adversely affecting prices and performance accordingly such increases in equity under management may require one or more of the advisors to modify trading decisions for series j that could have a detrimental effect on your investment      you cannot be assured of the advisors’ continued services which may be detrimental to the trust you cannot be assured that any advisor will be willing or able to continue to provide advisory services to series j for any length of time there is severe competition for the services of qualified trading advisors and series j may not be able to retain satisfactory replacement or additional trading advisors on acceptable terms or a current advisor may require series j to pay higher fees in order to be able to retain such advisor the managing owner may either terminate an advisor upon  days’ prior written notice or upon shorter notice if for cause each advisor has the right to terminate the advisory agreement in its discretion at any time for cause      limited ability to liquidate your investment there is no secondary market for the units while the units have redemption there are restrictions and possible fees assessed for example units may be redeemed only as of the close of business on the last business day of a calendar month provided a request for redemption is received at least five  business days prior to the end of such month excluding the last business day of the month in addition units of class i may be subject to redemption charges if redeemed prior to the first anniversary of their issuance in an amount equal to the product of i the net asset value per unit on the redemption date of the units being redeemed multiplied by ii the number of months remaining before the first anniversary of the date such units were purchased multiplied by iii th of  transfers of units are subject to limitations such as thirty  days’ advance notice of any intent to transfer also the managing owner may deny a request to transfer if it determines that the transfer may result in adverse legal or tax consequences for the trust or series j      possible illiquid markets may exacerbate losses futures and forward positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price it is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market a market disruption such as when foreign governments may take or be subject to political actions which disrupt the markets in their currency or major exports can also make it difficult to liquidate a position periods of illiquidity have accrued from timetotime in the past such as in connection with russia’s default on its sovereign debt in  such periods of illiquidity and the events that trigger them are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that any advisor will be able to do so there can be no assurance that market illiquidity will not cause losses for a series of the    table of contents trust the large size of the positions which an advisor is expected to acquire for series j increases the risk of illiquidity by both making its positions more difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so generally eagle has not historically allocated more than  of its assets under management pursuant to its eagle momentum program to overthecounter instruments graham allocates  of the assets allocated to it for foreign exchange trading to overthecounter instruments ortus expects to allocate  of the assets allocated to it to overthecounter instruments the risk of loss due to potentially illiquid markets is more acute in respect of overthecounter instruments than in respect of exchangetraded instruments because the performance of those contracts is not guaranteed by an exchange or clearinghouse and the series will be at risk to the ability of the counterparty to the instrument to perform its obligations thereunder because these markets are not regulated there are no specific standards or regulatory supervision of trade pricing and other trading activities that occur in those markets      because series j does not acquires any asset with intrinsic value the positive performance of your investment is wholly dependent upon an equal and offsetting loss futures and forward trading is a risk transfer economic activity for every gain there is an equal and offsetting loss rather than an opportunity to participate over time in general economic growth unlike most alternative investments an investment in series j does not involve acquiring any asset with intrinsic value overall stock and bond prices could rise significantly and the economy as a whole prospers while series j trades unprofitably      failure of futures and foreign exchange trading to be noncorrelated to general financial markets will eliminate benefits of diversification historically managed futures and foreign exchange generally have been noncorrelated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds noncorrelation means that there is no statistically valid relationship between the past performance of futures and forward contracts on the one hand and stocks or bonds on the other hand noncorrelation should not be confused with negative correlation where the performance would be exactly opposite between two asset classes because of this noncorrelation series j can be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market or viceversa the futures and forward markets are fundamentally different from the securities markets in that for every gain in futures and forward trading there is an equal and offsetting loss if series j does not perform in a manner noncorrelated with the general financial markets or does not perform successfully you will obtain no diversification benefits by investing in the units and series j may have no gains to offset your losses from other investments      broad indices may perform quite differently from individual investments in the discussion under “investment factors” the concepts of overall portfolio diversification and noncorrelation of asset classes are discussed and illustrated by the use of a generally accepted index that represents each asset category stocks are represented by the sp  index and msci eafe index bonds are represented by the lehman longterm government bond index futures funds are represented by the barclay cta index and currencies are represented by the barclay currency index because each index is a dollarweighted average of the returns of multiple underlying investments the overall index return and risk may be quite different from the return of any individual investment for example the “barclay cta index” is an unweighted index that attempts to measure the performance of the cta industry the index measures the combined performance of all ctas that have more than four years of past performance for purposes of calculating the index the first four years of a cta’s performance history is ignored accordingly such index reflects the volatility and risk of loss characteristics of a very broadly diversified universe of advisors and not of a single fund or advisor therefore the performance of series j will be different than that of the barclay cta index and the barclay currency index      advisors trading independently of each other may reduce profit potential and insurance risks through offsetting positions the advisors trade entirely independently of each other two advisors may from time to time take opposite positions eliminating any possibility that an investor that holds units in series j may profit from these positions considered as a whole but incurring the usual expenses associated with taking    table of contents such positions the advisors’ programs may at times be similar to one another thereby negating the benefits of investing in more than one advisor by purchasing units of series j which may in fact increase risk two or more advisors may compete with each other to acquire the same position thereby increasing the costs incurred by each of them to take such position it is also possible that two or more advisors although trading independently could experience drawdowns at the same time thereby negating the potential benefit associated with exposure to more than one advisor and more than one program series j’s multiadvisor structure will not necessarily control the risk of speculative futures or forward trading multiadvisor funds may have significant volatility and risk despite being relatively diversified among trading advisors      trading on commodity exchanges outside the united states is not subject to us regulation each of the advisors is expected to engage in some or all of its trading on commodity exchanges outside the united states trading on such exchanges is not regulated by any united states governmental agency and may involve certain risks not applicable to trading on united states exchanges in trading contracts denominated in currencies other than us dollars series j will be subject to the risk of adverse exchangerate movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts investors could incur substantial losses from trading on foreign exchanges by series j to which such investors would not have been subject had the advisors limited their trading to us markets on an annual basis each of the below programs traded approximately the following percentage of assets on foreign exchanges   program    range   graham global diversified at  leverage      eagle momentum program      ortus major currency program      the above ranges are only approximations with respect to each offered program actual percentages may be either lesser or greater than abovelisted past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results currently in its allocation of maximum exposures to different markets and sectors the exposure of graham’s global diversified at  leverage allocated to trades on foreign exchanges is set by its system at approximately  meaning that if identifiable trends existed in all the markets graham’s global diversified at  leverage trades over an entire year the approximate percentage range of assets of graham’s global diversified at  leverage allocated for trading on foreign exchanges would be approximately  the actual percentage of graham’s global diversified at  leverage assets traded on foreign exchanges over any period of time however depends greatly on trading conditions and can therefore vary widely for example to the extent there are no trends on domestic exchanges graham’s global diversified at  leverage would minimize its trading on them thereby increasing the actual percentage of graham’s global diversified at  leverage assets traded on foreign exchanges it is therefore quite possible that though the theoretical allocation to foreign markets is set at approximately  of its assets graham’s global diversified at  leverage’s actual percentage trading on foreign exchanges for a given period may be much higher in consequence of domestic markets offering fewer trading opportunities      various actual and potential conflicts of interest may be detrimental to unitholders the trust is subject to actual and potential conflicts of interests involving the managing owner the advisors various brokers and selling agents the managing owner the advisors and their respective principals all of which are engaged in other investment activities are not required to devote substantially all of their time to the trust’s business which also presents the potential for numerous conflicts of interest with the trust as a result of these and other relationships parties involved with the trust have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the trust and its unitholders the managing owner has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest consequently investors will be dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts to resolve them equitably although the managing owner attempts to monitor these conflicts it is extremely difficult if not impossible for the managing owner to ensure that these conflicts do not in fact result in adverse consequences to series j    table of contents the trust may be subject to certain conflicts with respect to its clearing broker its futures broker and any executing broker including but not limited to conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the clearing broker the futures broker and executing brokers the selling agent and the correspondent selling agents will be entitled to ongoing compensation as a result of their clients remaining in series j so a conflict exists between their interest in maximizing compensation and in advising their clients to make investment decisions in such clients’ best interests the managing owner and the selling agent are both owned by kenmar holdings inc or khi which could give rise to conflicts of interest because their compensation in each role is based on the net asset value of units outstanding like the employees of the correspondent selling agents the employees of the selling agent may have a conflict of interest between acting in the best interest of their clients and assuring continued compensation to their employer khi has entered into a loan agreement with ubs loan finance llc an affiliate of ubs securities among other things to facilitate the selling agent’s payment of the initial service fee with respect to the class i units ubs loan finance may make or deny a loan to khi in its sole discretion in the event of a default by khi ubs loan finance may call any or all outstanding loans moreover ubs loan finance may terminate the loan agreement or call any or all outstanding loans at any time in its sole discretion the ability of the managing owner and the selling agent to continue to operate the trust and series j and to offer the units may be adversely impacted in the event that ubs loan finance call any outstanding loan terminates the loan agreement or refuses to make any loan to khi      unitholders taxed currently unitholders are subject to tax each year on their allocable share of the income or gains if any of series j whether or not they receive distributions moreover the managing owner does not intend to make any distributions to unitholders in respect of series j consequently unitholders will be required either to redeem units or to make use of other sources of funds to discharge their tax liabilities in respect of any profits earned by series j in comparing the profit objectives of series j with the performance of more familiar securities in which one might invest prospective investors must recognize that if they purchased equity or debt there probably would be no tax due on the appreciation in the value of such holdings until disposition in the case of series j on the other hand a significant portion of any appreciation in the net asset value per unit must be paid in taxes by the unitholders every year resulting in a substantial cumulative reduction in their net aftertax returns because unitholders will be taxed currently on their allocable share of the income or gains of series j if any series j may trade successfully but investors nevertheless would have recognized significantly greater gains on an aftertax basis had they invested in conventional stocks with comparable performance the performance information included in this prospectus is presented exclusively on a pretax basis      limitation on deductibility of “investment advisory fees” noncorporate unitholders may be required to treat the amount of incentive fees and other expenses of series j as “investment advisory fees” which may be subject to substantial restrictions on deductibility for federal income tax purposes in the absence of further regulatory or statutory clarification the managing owner is not classifying these expenses as “investment advisory fees” but this is a position to which the internal revenue service the irs may object if a substantial portion of the fees and other expenses of series j were characterized as “investment advisory fees” an investment in series j might no longer be economically viable      taxation of interest income irrespective of trading losses the net asset value per unit reflects the trading profits and losses as well as the interest income earned and expenses incurred by series j however losses on series j’s trading will be almost exclusively capital losses and capital losses are deductible against ordinary income only to the extent of  per year in the case of noncorporate taxpayers consequently if a noncorporate unitholder had for example an allocable trading ie capital loss of  in a given fiscal year and allocable interest ie ordinary income after reduction for expenses of  the unitholder would have incurred a net loss in the net asset value of such unitholder’s units equal to  but would    table of contents recognize taxable income of  assuming a  tax rate the limited deductibility of capital losses for noncorporate unitholders could result in such unitholders having a tax liability in respect of their investment in series j despite incurring a financial loss on their units      possibility of a tax audit of both series j and the unitholders there can be no assurance that the tax returns of series j will not be audited by the irs if such an audit results in an adjustment unitholders could themselves be audited as well as being required to pay additional taxes interest and possibly penalties prospective investors are strongly urged to consult their own tax advisers and counsel with respect to the possible tax consequences to them of an investment in series j such tax consequences may differ in respect of different investors      failure or lack of segregation of assets may increase losses the commodity exchange act requires a futures commission merchant or fcm or clearing broker to segregate all funds received from customers from such broker’s proprietary assets if the clearing broker fails to do so the assets of series j might not be fully protected in the event of their bankruptcy furthermore in the event of the clearing broker’s bankruptcy series j could be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the clearing broker’s combined customer accounts even though certain property specifically traceable to series j for example treasury bills deposited by series j with the clearing broker as margin was held by the clearing broker the clearing broker has been the subject of certain regulatory and private causes of action the material actions are described under “the clearing broker and futures broker” in the event of the fcm’s bankruptcy series j may recover a prorata share or none of its assets      default by counterparty and credit risk could cause substantial losses dealers in forward contracts are not regulated by the commodity exchange act and are not obligated to segregate customer assets as a result unitholders do not have such basic protections with respect to the trading in forward contracts by series j this lack of regulation in these markets could expose series j in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by the counterparties series j also faces the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to the overthecounter contracts unlike in futures contracts the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions as a result there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions the clearing member clearing organization or other counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations in which case series j could suffer significant losses on these contracts      regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in the trust considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools in particular commodity pools such as series j publicly distributed in the united states there has been significant international governmental concern expressed regarding for example i the disruptive effects of speculative trading on the central banks’ attempts to influence exchange rates and ii the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general there is a possibility of future regulatory changes altering perhaps to a material extent the nature of an investment in series j the futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes regulations and margin requirements in addition the cftc and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including for example the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading the regulation of futures and forward transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action the effect of any future regulatory change on the trust is impossible to predict but could be substantial and adverse    table of contents    trust trading is not transparent the trading decisions in respect of series j are made by one or more advisors while the managing owner receives daily trade confirmations from the clearing broker and foreign exchange dealers such information is not provided to unitholders and series j’s trading results are reported to the unitholders monthly accordingly an investment in series j does not offer you the same transparency ie an ability to review all investment positions daily that a personal trading account offers the managing owner may but is under no obligation to provide estimated daily or weekly values to unitholders      lack of independent experts representing investors the managing owner has consulted with counsel accountants and other experts regarding the formation and operation of the trust and series j no counsel has been appointed to represent you in connection with the offering of the units accordingly you should consult your own legal tax and financial advisers regarding the desirability of an investment in series j      forwards swaps hybrids and other derivatives are not subject to cftc regulation series j may trade foreign exchange contracts in the interbank market since forward contracts are traded in unregulated markets between principals the commodity pools also assume the risk of loss from counterparty nonperformance in the future series j may also trade swap agreements hybrid instruments and other offexchange contracts swap agreements involve trading income streams such as fixed rate or floating rate interest hybrids are instruments that combine features of a security with those of a futures contract the dealer market for offexchange instruments is becoming more liquid because there is no exchange or clearing house for these contracts the trust will be subject to the credit risk and nonperformance of the counterparty additionally because these offexchange contracts are not regulated by the cftc series j will not receive the protections that are provided by the cftc’s regulatory scheme there may be an additional risk due to the fact series j may trade foreign exchange contracts offexchange and as such does not have protection of an exchange there is also the additional risk that the assets held with the clearing broker for trading offexchange foreign currencies are not required to be segregated      foreign exchange currency trading is not subject to cftc regulation certain advisors graham and ortus in particular will trade their programs by entering into spot and forward transactions involving currencies with united states and foreign banks and currency dealers as with the risks involved in forward contracts see above trading in spot and forward foreign exchange transactions is not regulated by the cftc and such contracts are not traded on or guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house      possibility of termination of the trust or series j before expiration of its stated term as managing owner the managing owner may withdraw from the trust upon  days’ notice which would cause the trust and each series to terminate unless a substitute managing owner were obtained other events such as a longterm substantial loss suffered by series j could also cause such series to terminate before the expiration of its stated term this could cause you to liquidate your investments and upset the overall maturity and timing of your investment portfolio if the registrations with the cftc or memberships in the nfa of the managing owner or the clearing broker were revoked or suspended such entity would no longer be able to provide services to the trust      losses by an advisor could deplete all of the assets of series j including assets that were allocated for management by another advisor because series j allocates its assets to managed accounts it is theoretically possible that catastrophic losses by a single advisor to a managed account could deplete all the assets of series j even those assets that were allocated for management to other advisors catastrophic losses by an advisor to a managed account in excess of the amount of the assets allocated to such advisor could occur as a result of the high degree of embedded leverage in the instruments being traded and the trading strategies being employed by each of the advisors if such losses were to occur they could be liabilities of series j generally and all of the assets of series j could be available to the trust’s creditors to satisfy claims attributable to the advisor whose strategies resulted in such catastrophic losses    table of contents series j and its objectives objectives     •   significant profits over time     •   performance volatility commensurate with profit potential     •   controlled risk of loss     •   diversification within a traditional portfolio typically consisting entirely of “long” equity and debt positions and reduced dependence on a single nation’s economy by accessing global financial commodity and other nonfinancial futures markets series j’s potential for aggressive capital growth arises from the profit possibilities offered by the global futures forward and options markets and the skills of the professional trading organizations selected to manage the assets of series j the fact that series j can profit from both rising and falling markets adds an element of profit potential that is not present in longonly strategies however series j can also incur losses from both rising and falling markets that adds to the risk of loss in addition to its profit potential and risk of loss series j also could help reduce the overall volatility or risk of a portfolio by investing in markets that operate independently from us stock and bond markets and therefore may be considered as noncorrelated series j may provide positive returns even when us stock and bond markets are experiencing flat to negative performance and may provide negative returns even when us stock and bond markets are experiencing flat to positive performance noncorrelation should not be confused with negative correlation where the performance would be exactly opposite between a series and us stock and bond markets series j is structured to substantially eliminate the administrative burden that would otherwise be involved if you engaged directly in futures or forward transactions among other things you will receive directly from the managing owner monthly unaudited financial reports and an annual audited financial statement setting forth in addition to certain other information the net asset value per unit trading profits or losses and the expenses of series j for the period as well as all tax information relating to series j necessary for you to complete your federal income tax returns the approximate net asset value per unit may be available at times other than monthend from the managing owner upon request the managing owner makes no guarantee that the investment objectives for series j will be achieved investment philosophy series j is managed by the managing owner     •   selects clearing brokers and in conjunction with the selling agent selects correspondent selling agents for series j and selects the advisor or advisors for series j     •   monitors the trading activity and performance of each advisor for compliance with such advisor’s own trading policies and risk control strategies     •   selects the trust’s administrator and the trust’s auditor     •   determines if an advisor should be removed or replaced     •   negotiates advisory fees and brokerage commissions and     •   performs such other services as the managing owner believes that series j may from time to time require the managing owner believes that an effective means of controlling the risks of futures forward and options trading is by using a portfolio of advisors the trust affords you an opportunity to maintain an equal exposure to each of the three advisors rebalanced quarterly however no assurance can be given that you will successfully diversify your exposure to these risks by purchasing units of series j diversification market diversification as global markets and investing become more complex the inclusion of professionally managed futures may continue to increase in traditional portfolios of stocks and bonds managed by advisors seeking improved balance and diversification the    table of contents globalization of the world’s economy has the potential to offer significant investment opportunities as major political and economic events continue to have an influence in some cases a dramatic influence on the world’s markets creating risk but also providing the potential for profitable trading opportunities by allocating a portion of the risk segment of their portfolios to selected advisors specializing in futures forward and options trading investors have the potential if their futures investments are successful to enhance their prospects for improved performance as well as to reduce the volatility of their portfolios over time and the dependence of such portfolios on any single nation’s economy additionally by utilizing three advisors simultaneously series j will provide multiple timing parameters and different sector focuses producing a portfolio that may be quite different from that of a singleadvisor fund remainder of page left

accounting policies preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates series j’s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used the managing owner has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing series j’s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments involves a critical accounting policy the market values of futures exchange traded contracts is verified by the administrator which obtains valuation data from third party data providers such as bloomberg and reuters and compares those prices with the clearing broker the market value of currency swap and forward nonexchange traded contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of pm on the last business day of the reporting period all values assigned by the administrator and confirmed by the managing owner are final and conclusive as to all unitholders as such if actual results vary from estimates used they are anticipated not to have a material impact on the financial statements and related disclosures series j records all investments at fair value in its financial statements with changes in fair value reported as a component of trading profits losses in the statements of income loss generally fair values are based on quoted market prices however in certain circumstances significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining fair value in the absence of an active market closing price liquidity and capital resources general as of the date of this prospectus  of series j’s total net assets have been allocated to commodities and foreign exchange trading through the managed accounts a significant portion of the net asset value is likely to be held in us treasury bills and cash which will be used as margin for series j’s trading in commodities and foreign exchange the percentage that us treasury bills will bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of commodity interests change the balance of the net assets will be held in series j’s commodity or foreign exchange trading accounts the clearing broker credits series j with interest on  of its average daily equity maintained in its accounts with the clearing broker during each month series j’s commodities and foreign exchange contracts may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions regulatory considerations and other reasons for example commodity exchanges limit fluctuations in certain commodity futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as “daily limits” during a single day no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit once the price of a futures contract for a particular commodity has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in the commodity can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit commodity futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading such market conditions could prevent series j from promptly liquidating its commodity futures positions because series j’s business is to trade futures and forward contracts its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts market risk or the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts credit risk you should refer to series j’s  audited financial statement and the notes thereto copies of which are included in this prospectus for a further discussion on the credit and market risks associated with series j’s futures contracts market risk trading in futures and forward contracts including foreign exchange involves series j entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a particular commodity at a specified date and price the gross or face amount of the contracts which will typically be many times that of series j’s net assets being traded will significantly exceed series j’s future cash requirements since series j intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement as a result series j is generally subject only to the risk of loss arising from the change in the value of the contracts as such series j considers the “fair value” of its derivative instruments to be the net    table of contents unrealized gain or loss on the contracts the market risk that is associated with series j’s commitments to purchase commodities is limited to the gross or face amount of the contracts held however should series j enter into a contractual commitment to sell commodities it would be required to make delivery of the underlying commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash because the repurchase price to which a commodity can rise is unlimited entering into commitments to sell commodities will expose series j to unlimited risk series j’s exposure to market risk is influenced by a number of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held the inherent uncertainty of series j’s speculative trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could result in monthly losses considerably beyond series j’s experience to date and could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of investors’ capital credit risk by entering into futures or forward contracts series j is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations the counterparty for futures contracts traded on united states and on most foreign futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange in general clearinghouses are backed by their corporate members who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and as such should significantly reduce this credit risk in cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members ie some foreign exchanges it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions there is concentration risk on forward transactions entered into by series j as series j will utilize only one commodity broker series j has entered into a master netting agreement with the commodity broker and as a result will present unrealized gains and losses on open forward positions as a net amount in the statement of financial position the amount of risk associated with counterparty nonperformance of all of series j’s contracts will be the net unrealized gain included in the statement of financial condition however counterparty nonperformance on only certain of series j’s contracts may result in greater loss than nonperformance on all of series j’s contracts there can be no assurance that any counterparty clearing member or clearinghouse will meet its obligations to series j the managing owner attempts to minimize these market and credit risks by requiring series j and its advisors to abide by various trading limitations and policies which include limiting margin accounts trading only in liquid markets and permitting the use of stoploss provisions the managing owner monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies that include but are not limited to     •   executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties     •   limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined     •   generally limiting transactions to contracts that will be traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions series j’s commodity broker when acting as series j’s futures commission merchant in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures and options on contracts is required by commodity futures trading commission or cftc regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to series j all assets of series j relating to domestic futures and options trading and the commodity broker is not allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the commodity broker in addition the cftc regulations also require the commodity broker to secure assets of series j related to foreign futures and options trading there are no segregation requirements for assets related to forward trading series j does not have nor does it expect to have any capital assets series j series j commenced operations on december   with gross proceeds of  allocated to commodities trading additional contributions raised through the continuous offering from the sales of interests for the years ended december   and december   and the period december   through december   resulted in additional gross proceeds to series j of

be etched in the financial pantheon alongside  and  as defining events of their respective decades the us economy has cooled considerably since the beginning of the year and many economists are signifying a “recessionary like” outlook at best in the coming months not the “soft landing” that was anticipated while the us economy proved volatile throughout the year the rest of the world

the year emerging nations gained greater confidence in their domestic economic strength many especially in asia slowly abandoned the managed dollar peg the pound finished the year with gains on the dollar despite losses in december as a result of a boe rate decrease the euro had a strong year and benefited from perceptions that the european central bank or ecb would not be lowering rates any time soon as ecb president jean claude trichet issued a series of hawkish comments mainly as related to inflation concerns european union economic data was mixed to weak including a twentytwo month low reading of the german ifo business confidence index the yen closed out  up  for the year on the us dollar japanese economic data persisted as lackluster and those calling for a rate increase have now mostly backed away from that forecast the yuan extended its yearlong gradual advance in december as the peoples bank of china continued to contract since abandonment of the us dollar peg in

one key fundamental factor contributing to corn’s growth besides the evident global demand for ethanol is the increased quality of living in developing countries such as china and india on the production side perhaps with the exception of soybeans wherever crop interchangeability allows corn will continue to steal acres from competing agricultural products soybean prices finished the year over  which is second to historical highs set in june of  the fundamentals for soybeans remain demand driven china’s need for beans bean oil and bean meal is so massive that all importation taxes and tariffs on all three have been dropped which is a rare move on the supply side the battle for global acreage will hinge on the relative value of competing crops in  the wheat market realized an outstanding  increase in prices from  setting new all time record prices this gain is despite the historic drought in australia one of the world’s largest producers of the grain on the whole cotton

credit crisis but still tallied gains for the year for  the dow jones rose over  the sp  added  while the tech heavy nasdaq was the leading performer with a  gain the fourth quarter selloff was a result of traders becoming increasingly concerned about the economy in general and housing in particular some doubted the federal reserves or the fed resolve to address the economic issues in the face of growing inflation concerns also interest and demand for commodities as an alternative asset class weighed on the equity sector to a lesser extent european equities echoed the weak tone of the us

in this data the producer price index ppi was not as controlled climbing  the most since  the surge was caused by a jump in energy car and truck prices housing has been a major economic concern in

homebuilders’ confidence as indicated by the nahbwells fargo index fell in december the overall consumer confidence picture remained mixed with the high end and electronics sectors doing well november retail sales rose  the unusually warm weather hurt clothing sales in department stores third quarter gross domestic product a measure of economic growth was revised downwards to the lowest level since

accumulative appreciation of about  since the july  revaluation energies crude oil was strong during the first half of the year and weakened during the second half with the exception of a brief respite during november crude ended december around  per barrel which contrasts to its midjuly peak of nearly  per barrel record warm weather in key consuming regions in the us put pressure on the market during the fourth quarter as did a generally benign geopolitical scene and poor member compliance with opec’s announced production cuts the unusually warm weather kept heating oil under pressure during december heating oil will be dependent on a general recovery in commodity prices and a sudden weather shift in coming weeks department of energy gasoline inventories are  below last season the driving season was extended by the warm weather conditions natural gas fell during the fourth quarter with the weather weighing heavily on investor sentiment inventories are still burdensome and demand is slowing rather than rising during the normally strong seasonal demand time frame what remains to be seen is whether the markets have discounted the majority of these bearish fundamentals grains while december’s performance was mixed corn trended upwards for the fourth quarter as a whole the last week of the month quarter and year saw the posting of a multiyear high with the final price for  settling at the highest weekly close on the charts since the droughtdriven summer rally in july of  the main drivers behind the reawakening of corn prices were threefold  an increase in overseas demand due to improving global economic conditions  the expansion of the production of ethanol and  the ongoing increase in hedge fund and money managers’ investing in alternative noncorrelated asset classes for the quarter as a whole despite a large trading range the wheat market put in somewhat disappointing albeit upward trending performance the uncertainty caused by ongoing drought conditions in australia the relatively high price for wheat and tight global stocks had an effect on supply and demand the trend for soybean prices was higher for the fourth quarter of  export demand for soybeans soybean oil and soybean meal all appear to be increasing as corn production is increasingly diverted to the production of ethanol substitute feedstuffs with soybeans as the closest surrogate may also feel the upward pull of prices as the global supply of foreign cotton sold out late in the year prices began to move higher from midnovember through the end of the year the lethargy that characterized most of  was a product of a massive carryover of last year’s crop along with last summer’s unfortunate elimination of a marketing program which left us cotton uncompetitively priced indices us equities recorded their best gains in three years during the fourth quarter of  the weakness in real estate that may have caused a shift into equities large levels of global liquidity a drop in oil prices a quiet geopolitical atmosphere solid    table of contents earnings and a brisk mergers and acquisitions calendar all added to the positive performance a shift out of commodities also aided the tone of global equities blue chips financials oil and big caps did well and at the end of the quarter technology names took a leading role it was also a very good december fourth quarter and year for the european equity markets markets in germany the uk and france all ended higher for the fourth quarter heavy merger and acquisition activity was a major feature in europe along with a solid run of earnings and significant fund inflows the strong us market was also a psychological plus the prospect of further rate hikes from the ecb and to a lesser extent the boe failed to diminish enthusiasm asianpacific rim equities also recorded solid  gains despite volatile trading record highs were achieved in singapore australia and new zealand during the final session of the year as well as for china’s shanghai composite a growing japanese economy served to buoy enthusiasm and a modest  base interest rate was supportive thailand’s set index had a very volatile month after the central bank attempted to impose controls on capital for foreign investors in the stock market but that was quickly reversed when the set tumbled  and prices subsequently recovered however thailand has seen continuing political unrest interest rates as expected the fed remained on hold at its december  meeting the minutes of the most recent federal open market committee fomc meeting were virtually the same as the november meeting indicating that the fomc unanimously agreed that inflation persists as the primary concern to the economy however at the same time they stated the economy might have been a bit softer than previously thought in the international arena the ecb increased rates  basis points in december and the boe raised rates  basis points in november the boj made just one move to  in  japanese consumer data has been a bit sluggish something the boj will keep in focus the peoples bank of china is currently engaged in a tightening process and is actively draining liquidity by increasing reserve requirements metals a weak us dollar helped support gold for most of the quarter but during late december the dollar showed signs of a consolidation rally and gold fell plunging energy prices had a negative impact on gold prices as well silver traded at its best levels in more than six months during the quarter but ended the year off its highs for the year silver significantly outperformed gold speculative participation was heavy throughout the quarter setting the stage for high volatility a steady increase in inventories weighed on copper prices in the fourth quarter a lessening of labor concerns particularly in chile and canada and the fact that china’s buying pace slowed in  added to the negative tone zinc supplies remained tight and strong demand continued aluminum prices held up well in the fourth quarter in the face of a general commodity weakness nickel was one of the strongest performers in the metals group due to tight supply and a strong pattern of stainless steel demand softs forecasts for a significant global supply surplus of sugar weighed on sentiment causing prices to decline  on the year this made sugar the weakest agricultural commodity in the dow jonesaig index coffee prices remained relatively flat for  and overall global coffee demand was solid scaled back cocoa crop prospects for the ivory coast the world’s largest producer added to the commodity’s recent bullish tone the political situation in the ivory coast continues fairly quiet but civil unrest remains a potential factor the cattle market traded sideways for most of the fourth quarter until severe weather conditions reduced cattle supply and caused prices to rise in the second half of december hog supply was ample during the quarter as the us entered a seasonally slow demand period on the bright side the most recent usda estimate is that us pork exports will rise in  to follow the  increase year ended december    was an eventful year in the global economic markets the rise in global energy prices to historic highs was a primary factor that dominated the global economy along with many other economic geopolitical and social issues the us equity markets lagged most foreign equity markets in  the dow jones industrial index had its first annual loss since  while the    table of contents technology oriented nasdaq index had a modest  gain and the sp  index gained  for the year overall corporate earnings exceeded expectations for most of the year including the third and fourth quarters the impact of several hurricanes high energy prices and rising interest rates were among the negative factors for the year european equity markets outperformed the us equity markets by a significant margin for much of the year with the fourth quarter being particularly strong among the three major indices the german dax gained  the french cac  gained  and the british ftse  was up  asian equities were stronger than european equities as south korea’s kospi increased  and japan’s nikkei rose  the nikkei finished the year with seven consecutive monthly gains australia’s all ordinaries increased  one of the notable themes in us interest rates was a flattening yield curve and a gradual trend toward inversion the inversion finally occurred in december as the year finished with a  yield versus  for the year the inversion was the first in six years this pattern occurred in the face of  consecutive  point federal open market committee rate hikes to  in europe the european central bank raised rates  points to  but this was not considered an indication of a cycle of rate hikes as european economic growth while improved remained fairly modest the us dollar ended stronger in  not withstanding a volatile trading pattern during the year for the year the us dollar rose approximately  against the japanese yen and the euro the interest rate differential was the primary factor behind the us dollar’s solid performance the british pound finished  lower due to weakness in the uk economy as a result of rate increases by the bank of canada the canadian dollar gradually gained versus the us dollar ending the year up  the australian dollar declined in  despite rate hikes and strong equity markets the russian ruble decreased approximately  for the year the full impact of the revaluation of the chinese renminbi at midyear has yet to be realized crude oil and related products were among the largest gainers in the commodities markets for  energy prices peaked in the summer around the time of hurricanes katrina and rita and declined in october and november weather was a contributing influence to the decrease as above normal temperatures continued through the end of the year global demand however was ever increasing with china and india in the forefront in the metals gold prices steadily advanced in  particularly in the final quarter of the year strong physical and investment demand particularly from the far east was a yearlong feature european central banks were reserved sellers and a number of other central banks such as russia and opec nations increased the amount of gold in their reserve asset portfolios additionally gold assumed the role as an alternative currency in  as traders shied away from the us dollar japanese yen and euro silver prices tracked gold for much of the year due to strong physical demand from india in particular in the base metals copper prices rose significantly as strong chinese demand remained a driving force throughout the year sector performance year ended december

a speculative commodity pool the market sensitive instruments held by it are acquired for speculative trading purposes and substantially all of series j’s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss unlike an operating company the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral not incidental to series j’s main line of business market movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of series j’s open positions and consequently in series j’s earnings and cash flow series j’s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the level and volatility of interest rates exchange rates equity price levels the market value of financial instruments and contracts the diversification effects among series j’s open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades series j rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets consequently it is not possible to predict how a particular futures market scenario will affect performance and series j’s past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results value at risk is a measure of the maximum amount which the trust could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector however the inherent uncertainty of series j’s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by series j of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or nontrading losses far beyond the indicated value at risk or the trust’s experience to date ie “risk of ruin” in light of the foregoing as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections the quantification included in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the trust’s losses in any market sector will be limited to value at risk or by the trust’s attempts to manage its market risk standard of materiality materiality as used in this section is based on an assessment

exchangetraded contracts in which profits and losses on open positions are settled daily through variation margin exchange maintenance margin requirements have been used by series j as the measure of its value at risk maintenance margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in  of any oneday interval the maintenance margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected nearterm oneday price fluctuation maintenance margin has been used rather than the more generally available initial margin because initial margin includes a credit risk component which is not relevant to value at risk in the case of market sensitive instruments that are not exchangetraded almost exclusively currencies in the case of series j the margin requirements for the equivalent futures positions have been used as value at risk in those rare cases in which a futuresequivalent margin is not available dealers’ margins have been used    table of contents in quantifying series j’s value at risk  positive correlation in the different positions

and commodities qualitative disclosures regarding means of managing risk exposure the means by which the managing owner and the advisors severally attempt to manage the risk of series j’s open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded the advisors attempt to minimize market risk exposure by applying their own risk management trading policies which include the diversification of trading assets into various market sectors additionally the advisors have an oversight committee broadly responsible for evaluating and overseeing the advisors’ trading policies the oversight committee meets periodically to discuss and analyze issues such as liquidity position size capacity performance cycles and new product and market strategies the managing owner attempts to minimize market risk exposure by requiring the advisors to abide by various trading limitations and policies the managing owner monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies which include but are not limited to limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined and generally limiting transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions additionally the managing owner shall automatically terminate an advisor to series j if the net asset value of the assets allocated to such advisor declines by  during any year or since the commencement of trading activities furthermore the trust agreement provides that the trust or as the case may be series j will liquidate its positions and eventually dissolve if the trust or series j experiences a decline in the net asset value of  in any year or since the commencement of trading activities in each case the decline in net asset value is after giving effect for distributions contributions and redemptions the managing owner may impose additional restrictions through modifications of such trading limitations and policies

direct investment decisions for series j are made by the three advisors selected and monitored by the managing owner the assets of series j are allocated equally among the three advisors and rebalanced quarterly each current advisor is and it is anticipated that any subsequent advisor if any will be registered with and regulated by the cftc or exempt from such registration the registration of any advisor with the cftc and its membership in the nfa must not be construed to mean that any regulatory body has recommended or approved the advisor or series j although the following descriptions of each of the advisors and their trading methods and strategies are general and are not intended to be exhaustive such descriptions address the material aspects of each advisor’s program that is offered by the trust trading methods are proprietary and complex so only the most general descriptions are possible furthermore certain advisors may have chosen to refer to specific aspects of their trading systems methods and strategies which aspects may also be applicable to other advisors which did not choose to make explicit reference to these aspects of their own strategies as a result contrasts in the descriptions set forth herein may not in fact indicate a substantive difference between the trading methods and strategies involved while the managing owner believes that the description of the advisors’ methods and strategies included herein may be of interest to prospective investors such persons must be aware of the inherent limitations of such description this section contains brief biographical outlines and performance summaries of the series j’s advisors the success of series j is dependent upon the success of the advisors retained by or on behalf of series j from time to time to trade for its account in terms of attempting to reach an investment decision regarding series j however it is difficult to know how to assess advisor descriptions and performance summaries as trading methods are proprietary and confidential and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results furthermore the performance summaries provide only a brief overview of the advisors’ performance histories and have not been audited to the best of the managing owner’s knowledge none of the advisors or their principals owns any units in series j certain advisors trade “notional” equity for clients — ie trading such clients’ accounts as if more equity were committed to such accounts than is in fact the case series j’s accounts may at the managing owner’s discretion permit the advisors to trade the accounts on a basis that includes notional equity past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results furthermore the rates of return earned when an advisor is managing a limited amount of equity may have little relationship to the rates of return that such advisor may be able to achieve managing larger amounts of equity the advisors’ performance summaries appearing in this prospectus have in no respect been adjusted to reflect the charges to the trust certain of the accounts included in such performance summaries paid fees materially different from and in some cases materially lower than those charged to the trust trading of futures and forward contracts and related instruments is speculative and involves a high degree of risk there can be no assurance that the advisors will trade profitably or avoid incurring substantial losses    table of contents futures and foreign exchange trading methods in general systematic and discretionary trading approaches futures and foreign exchange traders may generally be classified as either systematic or discretionary a systematic trader will generally rely to some degree on judgmental decisions concerning for example what markets to follow and commodities to trade when to liquidate a position in a contract which is about to expire and how large a position to take in a particular commodity however although these judgmental decisions may have a substantial effect on a systematic trader’s performance his primary reliance is on trading programs or models that generate trading signals the systems utilized to generate trading signals are continuously evolving but the trading instructions generated by the systems being used are followed without significant additional analysis or interpretation discretionary traders while they may utilize market charts computer programs and compilations of quantifiable fundamental information to assist them in making trading decisions make such decisions on the basis of their own judgment and “trading instinct” not on the basis of trading signals generated by any program or model each approach involves certain inherent risks systematic traders may fail to capitalize on market trends that their systems would otherwise have exploited due to judgmental decisions made by them in the context of applying their generally mechanical trading systems discretionary traders may decide to make trades which would not have been signaled by a trading system and which result in substantial losses furthermore any trading system or trader may suffer substantial losses by misjudging the market systematic traders tend to rely more on computerized programs than do discretionary traders in addition due to their use of computers systematic traders are generally able to incorporate more data into a particular trading decision than are discretionary traders however when fundamental factors dominate the market trading systems may suffer rapid and severe losses due to their inability to respond to such factors until such factors have had a sufficient effect on the market to create a trend of enough magnitude to generate a reversal of trading signals by which time a precipitous price change may already be in progress preventing liquidation at anything but substantial losses technical and fundamental analysis in addition to being distinguished from one another by the criterion of whether they trade systematically or on the basis of their discretionary evaluations of the markets trading advisors are also distinguished as relying on either “technical” or “fundamental” analysis or on a combination of the two systematic traders tend to rely on technical analysis because the data relevant to such analysis is more susceptible to being isolated and quantified to the extent necessary to be successfully incorporated into a program or mathematical model than is most “fundamental” information but there is no inconsistency in attempting to trade systematically on the basis of fundamental analysis the fundamental information that can be evaluated by a formalized trading system is however limited to some extent in that it generally must be quantifiable in order to be processed by such a system technical analysis is not based on anticipated supply and demand factors instead it is based on the theory that the study of the commodities markets themselves will provide a means of anticipating future prices technical analysis operates on the theory that market prices at any given point in time reflect all known factors affecting the supply and demand for a particular commodity consequently technical analysis focuses not on evaluating those factors directly but on an analysis of market prices themselves theorizing that a detailed analysis of among other things actual daily weekly and monthly price fluctuations volume variations and changes in open interest is the most effective means of attempting to predict the future course of price movements fundamental analysis in contrast is based on the study of factors external to the trading markets that affect the supply and demand of a particular commodity in an attempt to predict future price levels such factors might include weather the economy of a particular country government policies domestic and foreign political and economic events and changing trade prospects fundamental analysis theorizes that by monitoring relevant supply and demand factors for a particular commodity a state of current or potential disequilibrium of market conditions may be identified that has yet to be reflected in the price level of that commodity fundamental analysis assumes that markets are imperfect that information is not instantaneously assimilated or disseminated and that econometric models can be constructed that generate equilibrium prices that may indicate that current prices are    table of contents inconsistent with underlying economic conditions and will accordingly change in the future trendfollowing “trendfollowing” traders gear their trading approaches towards positioning themselves to take advantage of major price movements as opposed to traders who seek to achieve overall profitability by making numerous small profits on shortterm trades or through arbitrage techniques “trendfollowing” traders assume that most of their trades will be unprofitable their objective is to make a few large profits more than offsetting their more numerous but smaller losses from capitalizing on major trends consequently during periods when no major price trends develop in a market a “trendfollowing” trader is likely to incur substantial losses risk control techniques an important aspect of any speculative futures strategy relates to the control of losses not only the ability to identify profitable trades unless it is possible to avoid major drawdowns it is very difficult to achieve longterm profitability traders often adopt fairly rigid “risk management” or “money management” principles such principles typically restrict the size of positions that will be taken as well as establish “stoploss” points at which losing positions must be liquidated it is important for prospective investors to recognize in reading the descriptions of the advisors’ various risk control techniques that none is “fail safe” and none can in fact assure that major drawdowns will be avoided not only do estimates of market volatility themselves require judgmental input but also market illiquidity can make it impossible for an account to liquidate a position against which the market is moving strongly whatever risk management principles are utilized similarly irrespective of how small the initial “probing” positions taken by an advisor are unless it trades profitably innumerable small losses incurred in the course of such “probing” can quickly accumulate into a major drawdown the advisors’ risk management principles should accordingly be seen more as a discipline applied to their trading in highly speculative markets than as an effective protection against loss not only are trading methods proprietary but they often are also continually evolving prospective investors and unitholders will generally not be informed of a change in an advisor’s trading approach unless managing owner is informed of such change and considers such change to be material in addition to the continually changing character of trading methods the commodity markets themselves are continually changing each advisor may in its sole discretion elect to trade any available futures or forward contract option or related instrument — both on united states markets and abroad — even if such advisor has never previously traded in that particular contract or market leveraging futures trading is highly leveraged as is each advisor’s trading program the average assets as margin with respect to series j is  this number is historical in nature and represents a composite of the average range of assets as margin used by the advisors the number may deviate either below or above the disclosed range any change

graham’s trend systems are designed to participate selectively in potential profit opportunities that can occur during periods of price trends in a diverse number of us and international markets the trend systems establish positions in markets where the price action of a particular market signals the computerized systems used by graham that a potential trend in prices is occurring the trend systems are designed to analyze mathematically the recent trading characteristics of each market and statistically compare such characteristics to the historical trading patterns of the particular market the trend systems also employ proprietary risk management and trade filter strategies that seek to benefit from sustained price trends while reducing risk and volatility exposure global diversified program gdp gdp features the first trend system that graham developed which began trading client accounts in  it utilizes multiple computerized trading models and offers broad diversification in both financial and nonfinancial markets trading in approximately  global markets gdp’s trend system is primarily longterm in nature and is intended to generate significant returns over time with an acceptable degree of risk and volatility the computer models on a daily basis analyze the recent price action the relative strength and the risk characteristics of each market and compare statistically the quantitative results of this data to years of historical data on each market graham selective trading program gst gst features a graham trend system developed in  which utilizes an appreciably different trading system than other graham trend systems the gst trend system uses a mathematical model to identify certain price patterns that have very specific characteristics indicating a high probability that a significant directional move will occur although the gst trend system does not trade against the market trend this model should be distinguished from a true trendfollowing strategy inasmuch as it will only participate in specific types of market moves that meet the restrictive criteria of the model typically requiring a substantial increase in volatility the k program k the k trend system was developed in  and commenced trading operations in january  like the gst trend system the k trend system uses a mathematical model to identify certain price patterns that have very specific characteristics indicating that there is a high probability that a significant directional move will occur the k trend system normally enters or exits a position only when a significant price and volatility spike takes place it is designed to have a high percentage of winning trades and it normally maintains a neutral position in approximately  of the markets in the portfolio the multitrend program the multitrend program provides access through one single investment to all of the abovementioned graham investment programs including the trend system and other component strategies of each investment program as of january   the multitrend program allocates  of its assets equally to each of gdp gst and k as market conditions or other circumstances change graham may alter the weightings of the individual programs and add or subtract other programs to the multitrend program as it deems appropriate trading trading policies graham trades actively in both us and foreign markets primarily in futures contracts forward contracts spot contracts and associated derivative instruments such as options and swaps graham engages in exchange for physical efp transactions which involve the exchange of a futures position for the underlying physical commodity without making    table of contents an open competitive trade on an exchange graham also may take long and short positions in equity securities fixed income securities hybrid instruments options warrants customized contractual agreements and other financial instruments as it endeavors to achieve superior results for investors and enhanced portfolio diversification graham at times will trade certain instruments as a substitute for futures or options traded on futures exchanges instruments and contracts not traded on any organized exchange may be entered into with banks brokerage firms or other financial institutions or commodity firms as counterparties graham has complete flexibility in the instruments and markets in which it may invest in connection with its programs’ systematic trading graham may employ discretion in determining the leverage and timing of trades for new accounts and the market weighting and participation in unusual or emergency market conditions graham may also utilize discretion in establishing positions or liquidating positions or otherwise reducing portfolio risk where graham believes in its sole discretion that it is in the potential best interest of its clients to do so while such actions are anticipated to occur very infrequently no assurance can be given that graham’s discretionary actions in these programs will enhance performance at standard leverage and given competitive market terms by clearing brokers and counterparties for major institutional customers graham’s investment programs normally require between  and  of an account’s equity to meet initial margin requirements with initial margin requirements over time expected to average  to  graham reserves the right in extraordinary market conditions to reduce leverage and portfolio risk if it feels in its sole discretion that it is in the potential best interest of its clients to do so while such actions are anticipated to occur very infrequently no assurance can be given that graham’s actions will enhance performance markets traded graham trades actively on a hour basis on most global exchanges as well as the hour interbank market for foreign exchange both in the us and abroad from time to time graham adds to or deletes markets from its trading programs as ongoing research and future market conditions warrant graham may decide to trade certain markets and contracts to the exclusion of others in its trading programs depending on graham’s views from time to time the decision to add or subtract markets from any investment program shall be at the sole discretion of graham clients will not be informed of these changes as they occur graham uses both quantitative and qualitative analysis in evaluating its investment programs in terms of both absolute performance and riskadjusted return it reviews the sharpe ratio sterling ratio average drawdown and many other measures of risk in determining which trading technique offers the best risk and volatility characteristics graham has also developed extremely sophisticated proprietary software to study optimal portfolio weighting strategies and the effect of specific markets on the performance risk correlation and volatility characteristics of its investment programs the actual weighting and leverage used in each market will change over time due to liquidity price action and risk considerations graham also devotes considerable attention to risk management at the portfolio level to ensure balance between markets and that the overall leverage used by graham is consistent with graham’s conservative views on risk performance record investors should note that the composite performance records include individual accounts that may have materially different rates of return on amounts actually invested even though they are traded according to the same investment program this is caused by material differences among accounts such as  procedures governing timing for the commencement of trading and means of moving toward full funding of new accounts  the period during which accounts are active  client trading restrictions  ratio of trading size to level of actual funds deposited with the futures commission merchant or fcm ie the extent of notional equity  the degree of leverage employed  the size of the account which can influence the size of positions taken and restrict the account from participating in all markets available to an investment program  the amount of interest income earned by an account which will depend on the rates paid by the fcm on equity deposits and the amount of equity invested in interestbearing obligations  the amount of management and incentive fees paid and the amount of brokerage commissions paid  the timing of orders to open or close positions  market conditions which influence the quality of trade executions  variations in fill prices and  the timing of additions and withdrawals notwithstanding these material differences each    table of contents composite performance record is a valid representation of the accounts included therein references to total assets managed by graham in a particular program or overall or rate of return on net assets include any notional equity and may include client and proprietary funds notional equity represents the additional amount of equity that exceeds the amount of equity actually committed to graham for management because notionally funded accounts are more highly leveraged than fullyfunded accounts they incur magnified gains and losses on their actual investment which does not include notional equity compared to fullyfunded accounts the rate of return percentage for each month is obtained by dividing the net income for the month by the net asset value as of the beginning of the month including contributions made at the start of the month in months where asset changes are made midmonth rates of return are calculated for each segment of the month and compounded for this purpose “net income” represents the gross income for the month in question net of all expenses and performance allocations the rate of return percentage for each year is determined by calculating the percentage return on an investment made as of the beginning of each year specifically a running index is calculated monthly compounded by the rate of return the annual percentage being the change in this index for the year divided by the year’s initial index graham advises exempt

or administrative actions against eagle or its principals trading approach systematic trading approach eagle is offering clients advisory services pursuant to a systematic model driven trading approach the approach is designed to capture and participate in trading opportunities and structural changes in the markets the systematic trading approach is designed to identify and participate in intermediate and long term price changes in markets systematization of strict trading rules is used to incorporate money management principles and volatility adjustment features decisions to initiate or liquidate positions are dependent upon computergenerated signals which are based on mathematical analysis of closing market prices and the incorporation of predetermined risk parameters volatility adjustment features are designed to trigger profittaking decisions and to adjust participation in markets which exhibit excessive volatility trading programs eagle’s systematic trading approach has served as a conceptual framework for the development of its trading programs each system is based on defining the market structures and situations it attempts to capture by formulation of trading rules that will best achieve its goals these goals are then analyzed with the use of substantial market data to confirm that the rules can be consistently applied in actual trading once the systems are used in actual trading they are constantly monitored and the trading rules are reevaluated to identify any need for refinements or modifications the systems are designed to trade on a fully invested basis in markets exhibiting price behavior which correspond to the market structure and situations they attempt to achieve while avoiding markets characterized by excessive volatility or sharp price corrections sharp price corrections or high volatility will generally trigger a scale down or even complete liquidation of positions eagle’s trading programs incorporate the trading concepts embedded in its systematic trading approach eagle momentum program the eagle momentum program or emp is a computerized technical trading system developed based on eagle’s extensive experience in observing and trading the global futures markets to capture short and intermediate term trading opportunities in markets that exhibit strong price momentum the current environment for each market is evaluated based on its recent trading range volatility and overall price behavior the trading program utilizes trading rules which are based on pattern recognition and money management techniques on both the individual market and portfolio levels emp’s discipline in evaluating market behavior and the attention given to market volatility as well as its risk control tend to screen participation to markets which provide good risk to reward potential emp will primarily be involved in markets that exhibit a rapid move away from the current trading range and exit quickly when the momentum fades this exit strategy attempts to dynamically adjust exposure before major corrections occur thus capturing the lion’s share of the profits the adoption of the trading philosophy to a computerized trading system was done by applying rule based techniques to confirm the trading concept over an extensive body of historical market data and by constantly monitoring and reevaluating the rules in actual trading the program currently covers  commodities currencies stock indices and global fixed income markets set forth is a list of the futures markets that the eagle momentum program currently tracks and in which it may trade eagle in its sole discretion reserves the right to change the markets and exchanges in which it trades the following parenthetical numbers reflect the approximate

monetary authority from the requirement to obtain a license under the securities investment business law  revision it has appointed ortus capital management limited as an investment adviser to provide recommendations investment advice and implementation assistances to it ortus capital management limited is a company incorporated in hong kong with limited liability and was licensed by the securities and futures commission of hong kong on august   to carry on type  regulated activity  asset management because ortus trades only foreign exchange contracts and does not trade futures neither ortus capital management cayman limited nor ortus capital management limited are registered with the cftc if ortus expects to trade futures it will comply with cftc regulations as used herein ortus shall refer to ortus capital management cayman limited ortus capital management limited or both ortus trades its major currency program for series j as described below for past performance of ortus see pages  through  investment philosophy ortus believes that in order to utilize its capital most effectively it is important to take advantage of the opportunities available in multiple financial markets although ortus’ investment activities span across global financial markets including global and regional currencies global fixed income and equity markets and commodity markets the investment strategies are based on the same underlying investment philosophy the investment philosophy focuses on the interrelationship and interplay between any given financial market and its underlying economic fundamentals that is the interdependence between the financial side and the real side the real sides of major financial markets are intrinsically interrelated although they often have their own characteristics for example the global economy is interrelated through trades of goods and services as well as flows of capital through global financial markets and each economy has its own structural characteristics in the case of an individual stock the fundamental or the real side includes among other things the company’s balance sheet and operating performance it also includes among other things strengths of its competitors and macro environment in which it operates intuitively there is a positive association between the financial side and the real side for example a positive shock in a country’s performance is usually associated with an appreciation of the country’s currency a positive surprise in a company’s performance is usually associated with a rise in the company’s stock price however it is not fruitful and not enough only to understand this positive association between the two sides it is far more important to understand and to measure the feedback relationship between the real side and the financial side over various time horizons at the early stage of an upward trend in an asset price there is usually an asymmetric sensitivity of the asset price with respect to the fundamental news this asymmetric response to news is consistent with an old saying referring to a bull market in stocks “good news is good news and no news is good news” certainly at this stage of price dynamics the feedback from the real side to the financial side is positive and dramatic uninformed market participants having observed the asymmetric price action can derive certain perceptions about future price dynamics that affect the demand for the asset thus creating a tendency for the asset price to trend a trend may actually occur if there is also a positive feedback from the financial side to the real side in many cases such reverse positive feedbacks do exist that is the underlying fundamentals do benefit from firming asset prices for example if the us dollar strengthens due to capital flows from the rest of the world the us economy will usually benefit from such capital flows because capital inflows to the us lower the cost of capital thus a momentum is set in motion in both the real and the financial side creating great investment opportunities at the end of an upward price trend there is an opposite and asymmetric price sensitivity with respect to fundamental news in this case good news may not be good news and bad news is really bad ortus relies on its own proprietary models to capture the essence of the positive association and feedback relationship between asset prices and their underlying economic fundamentals over various time horizons and to evaluate the riskreward profile of investment opportunities the approach is based on innovations and rigorous applications of financial theories and takes into account structural details interrelationships as well as feedback relationships the same investment philosophy can be applied to    table of contents stock markets fixed income markets commodities markets as well as to currency markets depending on the nature of such interrelationship and interplay for any given market the resulting investment horizon can range from a few months to several years intuitively the investment strategies move capital from less “productive” sectorsregions to more “productive” sectorsregions in the global economy based on ortus’ proprietary models which identify and evaluate the “productiveness” of capital by taking into account reward as well as risk ortus also relies on its own proprietary risk management strategies that are an integral part of the investment strategies the risk management strategies aim to maximize upside potential while damping downside shocks innovative risk measurement and dynamic strategies to optimally control the portfolio drawdowns are employed to ensure that the portfolio return distribution is skewed to the right not left ie the high return side not the low return side the resulting investment style has the following characteristics  systematic quantitative and model driven  based on independent extensive and continuous research and  disciplined and quantitative risk management investment process and risk management the investment process consists mainly of  opportunity identification and evaluation or market view formation  risk management portfolio optimization and optimal drawdown control and other risk management and  ongoing monitoring calibration and review market view formation ortus applies its proprietary models to the global financial markets and calibrates its models as the markets and economies evolve over time the data inputs that ortus uses are available publicly including economic and monetary data fiscal and monetary policies company andor industry specific data and financial market data such as stock prices exchange rates interest rates implied volatility implied correlations etc both current and historic data are employed ortus also pays special attention to special events or situations such as the internet bubble that may induce abnormal global capital flows the market views are expressed in terms of the expected moves risks associated and the correlations among markets over various time horizons that is the market views are represented by joint probability distributions of asset returns over various time horizons which is in sharp contrast to the common approach that is focused on point estimates of asset prices market views are monitored and reviewed as market conditions change risk management – portfolio optimization based on the market views which have taken into account the risks and correlations for various markets under consideration over various time horizons ortus constructs its investment portfolio based on its proprietary portfolio optimization models to optimize the riskreward profile of ortus’ capital the portfolio optimization is part of the risk management strategy and is related to other risk management measures described below risk management – optimal drawdown control and determination of portfolio size market risks are measured by their impact on net asset value or nav the traditional measure such as leverage ratios may not capture the true nature of exposure to risks in addition to the risk allocation by portfolio optimization ortus aims to optimally control the drawdown of nav as measured from the previously achieved nav peak to within a comfortable limit ortus relies on its own optimal risk management strategies to dampen downside shocks to nav as a result at any time the total size of the portfolio depends among other things on the position of the current nav relative to its previous high risk tolerance the size of capital ie the current nav and market conditions ongoing monitoring and review the investment process is a dynamic and continuous process various dimensions of the investment strategy are monitored and reviewed regularly portfolio and model adjustments may be necessary when market conditions change markets and instruments the investment strategies are normally implemented through the most liquid segments of the global capital markets that include fixed income markets equity markets commodity markets as well as global and regional currency markets the capital is allocated to any given market according to among other things the relative attractiveness of its riskreward profile its relationship with other markets and the liquidity of the market ortus invests    table of contents in holds sells including through short sales trades and otherwise deals in securities futures and overthecounter financial products in global financial markets for investment as well as for risk management purposes although ortus may employ a wide range of financial instruments such as securities futures options warrants fixed income products and variable income products bank deposits forwards swaps and other overthecounter derivative products it primarily uses simple plainvanilla instruments with substantial liquidity such as listed futures contracts and shortterm currency forward contracts ortus will seek to use the most efficient instruments to implement any particular strategy currently the markets involved and instruments used are currency spot transactions and currency forward and swap transactions with tenors not longer than  months among major currencies in addition ortus may invest a small portion of its capital in other public or private investment funds or managed accounts if

whether or what redemption charges apply to redeem units unitholders may contact their respective correspondent selling agent in writing if required by such correspondent selling agent correspondent selling agents must notify the managing owner in writing in order to effectuate redemptions of the units a signature guarantee may be required by your correspondent selling agent or the managing owner however a unitholder who no longer has a correspondent selling agent account must request redemption in writing signature guaranteed unless waived by the managing owner by corresponding with the

officer of creative technologies group inc a consulting company that specialized in networking and application support for the smallmedium enterprises market management of traders the managing owner’s hallmark is its extensive due diligence and emphasis on vigilant management of its portfolios of traders the managing owner analyzes trading and performance on a daily basis and performs ongoing due diligence with respect to each trader it retains including the advisors this detailed analysis identifies sources of profits and losses for each trader each day enabling management to make highly informed decisions regarding the performance of each such trader including the trust’s advisors based on the managing owner’s perception of market conditions advisor performance and other factors the managing owner may determine to remove or replace an advisor or shift to another trading program of an existing advisor if profitability risk assumptions or other significant factors indicate that replacement is in the best interests of the unitholders of the trust naturally these activities require a strong knowledge of trading and markets the managing owner operates and updates continuously a database that tracks over  different trading programs offered by traders around the globe added to these quantitative data are qualitative assessments based on detailed trader interviews and analysis of trades trading performance and trading strategies fiduciary obligations of the managing owner as managing owner of the trust the managing owner is effectively subject to the same restrictions imposed on “fiduciaries” under both statutory and common law the managing owner has a fiduciary responsibility to the unitholders to exercise good faith fairness and loyalty in all dealings affecting the trust consistent with the terms of the trust’s second amended and restated declaration of trust and trust agreement dated as of september   or the “declaration of trust” the trust is referred to as the “trust” in the declaration of trust that is attached hereto as exhibit a the general fiduciary duties which would otherwise be imposed on the managing owner which would make the operation of the trust as described herein impracticable due to the strict prohibition imposed by such duties on for example conflicts of interest on behalf of a fiduciary in its dealings with its beneficiaries are defined and limited in scope by the disclosure of the business terms of the trust as set forth herein and in the declaration of trust to which terms all unitholders by subscribing to the units are deemed to consent the trust as a publiclyoffered “commodity pool” is subject to the statement of policy of the north american securities administrators association inc relating to the registration for public offering of commodity pool interests or the nasaa guidelines the nasaa guidelines explicitly prohibit a managing owner of a commodity pool from “contracting away the fiduciary obligation owed to investors under the common law” consequently once the terms of a given commodity pool such as the trust are established the managing owner is effectively precluded from changing such    table of contents terms in a manner that disproportionately benefits the managing owner as any such change could constitute selfdealing under common law fiduciary standards and it is virtually impossible to obtain the consent of existing investors of the trust to such selfdealing whereas given adequate disclosure new investors subscribing to a pool should be deemed to evidence their consent to the business terms thereof by the act of subscribing the declaration of trust provides that the managing owner and its affiliates shall have no liability to the trust or to any unitholder for any loss suffered by the trust arising out of any action or inaction of the managing owner or its affiliates or their directors officers shareholders partners members or employees or the managing owner related parties if the managing owner related parties in good faith determined that such course of conduct was in the best interests of the trust and such course of conduct did not constitute negligence or misconduct by the managing owner related parties the trust has agreed to indemnify the managing owner related parties against claims losses or liabilities based on their conduct relating to the trust provided that the conduct resulting in the claims losses or liabilities for which indemnity is sought did not constitute negligence or misconduct and was done in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the trust the nasaa guidelines prescribe the maximum permissible extent to which the trust can indemnify the managing owner related parties and prohibit the trust from purchasing insurance to cover indemnification that the trust itself could not undertake directly fiduciary and regulatory duties of the managing owner an investor should be aware that the managing owner has a fiduciary responsibility to the unitholders to exercise good faith and fairness in all dealings affecting the trust under delaware law a beneficial owner of a business trust such as a unitholder of the trust may under certain circumstances institute legal action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated beneficial owners or a class action to recover damages from a managing owner of such business trust for violations of fiduciary duties or on behalf of a business trust a “derivative action” to recover damages from a third party where a managing owner has failed or refused to institute proceedings to recover such damages in addition beneficial owners may have the right subject to certain legal requirements to bring class actions in federal court to enforce their rights under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the securities and exchange commission or the sec beneficial owners who have suffered losses in connection with the purchase or sale of their beneficial interests may be able to recover such losses from a managing owner where the losses result from a violation by the managing owner of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws under certain circumstances unitholders also have the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the cftc against the managing owner a registered commodity pool operator the clearing brokers registered futures commission merchants and the advisors registered commodity trading advisors as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the commodity exchange act as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder private rights of action are conferred by the commodity exchange act as amended investors in commodities and in commodity pools may therefore invoke the protections provided by such legislation there are substantial and inherent conflicts of interest in the structure of the trust that are on their face inconsistent with the managing owner’s fiduciary duties one of the purposes underlying the disclosures set forth in this prospectus is to disclose to all prospective unitholders these conflicts of interest so that the managing owner may have the opportunity to obtain investors’ informed consent to such conflicts prospective investors who are not willing to consent to the various conflicts of interest described under “conflicts of interest” and elsewhere are ineligible to invest in the trust the managing owner presently intends to raise such disclosures and consent as a defense in any proceeding brought seeking relief based on the existence of such conflicts of interest the foregoing summary describing in general terms the remedies available to unitholders under federal and state law is based on statutes rules and decisions as of the date of this prospectus this is a rapidly developing and changing area of the law therefore unitholders who believe that they may have a legal cause of action against any of the foregoing parties should consult their own counsel as to their evaluation of the status of the applicable law at such time    table of contents investment of the managing owner in the trust the managing owner andor its affiliates have agreed to purchase and maintain an interest in each series in an amount not less than  of the net asset value of such series or  whichever is greater as of february   the managing owner and its affiliates have subscribed for  series j class i general units and  series j class ii general units management voting by unitholders the unitholders take no part in the management or control and have no voice in the operations of the trust series j or their respective businesses unitholders voting together as a single series may however remove and replace the managing owner as the managing owner of the trust and series j and may amend the declaration of trust except in certain limited respects by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding units then owned by unitholders as opposed to by the managing owner and its affiliates the owners of a majority of the outstanding units then owned by unitholders may also compel dissolution of the trust and series j the owners of  of the outstanding units then owned by unitholders have the right to bring a matter before a vote of the unitholders the managing owner has no power under the declaration of trust to restrict any of the unitholders’ voting rights any units purchased by the managing owner or its affiliates as well as the managing owner’s general liability interest in series j are nonvoting the managing owner has the right unilaterally to amend the declaration of trust as it applies to series j provided that any such amendment is for the benefit of and not adverse to the unitholders of series j or the trustee and also in certain unusual circumstances — for example if doing so is necessary to effect the intent of series j’s tax allocations or to comply with certain regulatory requirements in the event that the managing owner or the unitholders vote to amend the declaration of trust in any material respect the amendment will not become effective prior to all unitholders having an opportunity to redeem their units recognition of the trust and the series in certain states a number of states do not have “business trust” statutes such as that under which the trust has been formed in the state of delaware it is possible although unlikely that a court in such a state could hold that due to the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction the unitholders although entitled under delaware law to the same limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private corporation for profit organized under the laws of the state of delaware are not so entitled in such state to protect unitholders against any loss of limited liability the declaration of trust provides that no written obligation may be undertaken by a series of the trust unless such obligation is explicitly limited so as not to be enforceable against any unitholder personally furthermore each series itself indemnifies all its unitholders against any liability that such unitholders might incur in addition to that of a beneficial owner the managing owner is itself generally liable for all obligations of each series of the trust and will use its assets to satisfy any such liability before such liability would be enforced against any unitholder individually possible repayment of distributions received by unitholders indemnification by unitholders the units are limited liability investments investors may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized on their investment however unitholders of a series could be required as a matter of bankruptcy law to return to the estate of such series any distribution they received at a time when such series was in fact insolvent or in violation of the declaration of trust in addition although the managing owner is not aware of this provision ever having been invoked in the case of any public futures fund unitholders of a series agree in the declaration of trust that they will indemnify such series for any harm suffered by it as a result of     •   unitholders’ actions unrelated to the business of such series     •   transfers of their units in violation of the declaration of trust or    table of contents   •   taxes imposed on such series by the states or municipalities in which such investors reside the foregoing repayment of distributions and indemnity provisions other than the provision for unitholders of a series indemnifying such series for taxes imposed upon it by the state or municipality in which particular unitholders reside which is included only as a formality due to the fact that many states do not have business trust statutes so that the tax status of a series of the trust in such states might theoretically be challenged — although the managing owner is unaware of any instance in which this has actually occurred are commonplace in publiclyoffered commodity pools as well as other trusts and limited partnerships transfers of units restricted a unitholder may subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws assign such unitholder’s units upon notice to the trust and the managing owner no assignment will be effective in respect of the trust or the managing owner until the first day of the month succeeding the month in which such notice is received no assignee may become a substituted unitholder except with the consent of the managing owner and upon execution and delivery of an instrument of transfer in form and substance satisfactory to the managing owner no units may be transferred where after the transfer either the transferee or the transferor would hold less than the minimum number of units equivalent to an initial minimum purchase except for transfers by gift inheritance intrafamily transfers family dissolutions and transfers to affiliates there are and will be no certificates for the units any transfers of units will be reflected on the books and records of the applicable series of the trust transferors and transferees of units will each receive notification from the managing owner to the effect that such transfers have been duly reflected as notified to the managing owner reports to unitholders each month the managing owner reports such information as the cftc may require to be given to the participants in “commodity pools” such as series j and any such other information as the managing owner may deem appropriate the managing owner also distributes to unitholders generally by march  of each year certified financial statements and the tax information related to each series of the trust necessary for the preparation of their annual federal income tax returns the managing owner will notify unitholders of any change in the fees paid by series j or of any material changes in the basic investment policies or structure of series j any such notification shall include a description of unitholders’ voting rights general in compliance with the statement of policy of the north american securities administrators association inc relating to the registration of commodity pool programs under state securities or “blue sky” laws the declaration of trust provides that     •   the executing and clearing commissions paid by series j shall be reasonable and the managing owner shall include in the annual reports containing each series’ certified financial statements distributed to unitholders each year the approximate roundturn equivalent rate paid on series j’s trades during the preceding year     •   no rebates or giveups among other things may be received from series j by any of the selling agents in respect of sales of the units of series j and such restriction may not be circumvented by any reciprocal business arrangements among any selling agents or any of their respective affiliates and series j     •   no trading advisor of series j including

material federal income tax consequences to united states taxpayers who are individuals partnership tax status of series j in the opinion of counsel series j will be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and based on the managing owner’s representations as to the type of income expected to be earned by series j will not be treated as a    table of contents “publiclytraded partnership” taxable as a corporation taxation of unitholders on profits or losses each unitholder will be subject to tax on such unitholder’s share of series j’s income and gains if any even if such unitholders do receive any cash distributions or redeem units in addition a unitholder may be subject to payment of taxes on series j’s interest income even though the net asset value per unit of series j has decreased due to trading losses see “tax on capital gains and losses interest income” on the following page series j provides each of its unitholders with an annual schedule of such unitholder’s share of tax items series j generally allocates these items of gain and loss equally to each unit however when a unitholder redeems units series j shall allocate capital gains or losses to the unitholder of series j so as to reduce or eliminate any difference between the redemption proceeds and the tax basis of such units a unitholder’s adjusted tax basis in a unit equals the amount originally paid for the unit increased by income or gains allocated to the unit and decreased but not below zero by distributions deductions or losses allocated to the unit limited deductibility of trust losses and deductions a unitholder may not deduct losses or deductions in excess of his or her tax basis in his or her units as of yearend generally a unitholder’s tax basis in such unitholder’s units is the amount paid for such units reduced but not below zero by such unitholder’s share of any distributions losses and deductions and increased by such unitholder’s share of income and gains however a unitholder subject to “atrisk” limitations generally noncorporate taxpayers and closelyheld corporations can only deduct losses to the extent he is “atrisk” the “atrisk” amount is similar to tax basis except that it does not include any amount borrowed on a nonrecourse basis or from someone with an interest in the trust limited deductibility for certain expenses the managing owner does not consider the incentive fee as well as other ordinary expenses of series j to be investment advisory expenses or other expenses of producing income accordingly for tax reporting purposes the managing owner currently treats the ordinary expenses of series j as ordinary business expenses not subject to the limitations that apply to investment advisory expenses described below however the irs might contend otherwise and to the extent the irs recharacterizes these expenses a unitholder would have the amount of the ordinary expenses allocated to him treated accordingly individual taxpayers are subject to material limitations on their ability to deduct investment advisory fees unreimbursed expenses of an employee and certain other expenses of producing income not resulting from the conduct of a trade or business for individuals who itemize deductions the expenses of producing such income including “investment advisory fees” are aggregated with unreimbursed employee business expenses certain other expenses of producing income and deductions or collectively the aggregate investment expenses and such aggregate investment expenses are deductible only to the extent such amount exceeds  of the individual’s adjusted gross income in addition aggregate investment expenses in excess of the  threshold when combined with certain other itemized deductions are subject to a reduction generally equal to the lesser of onethrid of  of the individual’s adjusted gross income in excess of a certain threshold amount and  of certain itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the tax year moreover such aggregate investment expenses are miscellaneous itemized deductions which are not deductible by an individual in calculating his or her alternative minimum tax liability if the profit shares the incentive fee and other expenses of series j were determined to constitute “investment advisory fees” an individual unitholder’s pro rata share of the amounts so characterized would be included in aggregate investment expenses potentially subject to the deduction limitations described above in addition each individual unitholder’s share of income from series j would be increased solely for tax purposes by such unitholder’s pro rata share of the amounts so characterized any such characterization by the irs could require unitholders to file amended tax returns and pay additional taxes plus interest it is unlikely that tax penalties would be imposed on account of such an irs characterization yearend marktomarket of open section  contract positions section  contracts are futures options on futures and stock index options traded on us exchanges and certain foreign currency contracts section  contracts that remain open at the end of    table of contents a tax year are treated for tax purposes as if such positions had been sold at yearend and any gain or loss is recognized the gain or loss on section  contracts is characterized as  shortterm capital gain or loss and  longterm capital gain or loss regardless of how long any given position has been held nonsection  contracts include among other things certain foreign currency transactions and nonus exchange traded futures gain or loss on any nonsection  contracts is recognized when sold by a series and are primarily shortterm gain or loss tax on capital gains and losses interest income as described under “— yearend marktomarket of open section  contract positions” series j’s trading not including its cash management which generates primarily ordinary income generates  longterm capital gains or losses and  shortterm capital gains or losses from its section  contracts and primarily shortterm capital gain or loss from any nonsection  contracts individuals pay tax on longterm capital gains at a maximum rate of  shortterm capital gains are subject to tax at the same rates as ordinary income individual taxpayers may deduct capital losses only to the extent of their capital gains plus  accordingly series j could incur significant losses but a unitholder could be required to pay taxes on such unitholder’s share of series j’s interest income if an individual taxpayer incurs a net capital loss for a year he may elect to carry back up to three years the portion of such loss that consists of a net loss on section  contracts a taxpayer may deduct such losses only against net capital gain for a carryback year to the extent that such gain includes gains on section  contracts to the extent that a taxpayer could not use such losses to offset gains on section  contracts in a carryback year the taxpayer may carry forward such losses indefinitely as losses on section  contracts syndication expenses neither series j nor any unitholder of series j will be entitled to any deduction for series j’s syndication expenses including offering expense reimbursements paid to the managing owner and any amounts paid to any selling agents nor can such expenses be amortized by series j or any unitholder such expenses may be included in capital losses upon redemption unrelated business taxable income taxexempt unitholders of series j generally will not be required to pay tax on their share of income or gains of series j provided that such unitholders do not purchase units with borrowed funds certain taxexempt unitholders may be subject to special setaside requirements or excise taxes as to which they should consult their tax advisers irs audits of series j and their respective unitholders if series j is audited the irs is required to audit series jrelated items at the series level rather than the unitholder level the managing owner is the “tax matters partner” of series j with general authority to determine series j’s responses to a tax audit if an audit of series j results in an adjustment all unitholders of series j may be required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties state and other taxes in addition to the federal income tax consequences described above series j and its unitholders may be subject to various state and other taxes tax elections the managing owner has the discretion to make any election available to series j under the code such elections may affect the timing andor character of gains and losses generated by series j     prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisers before deciding whether to invest    table of contents purchases by employee benefit plans although there can be no assurance that an investment in series j or any other managed futures product will achieve the investment objectives of an employee benefit plan in making such investment futures investments have certain features that may be of interest to such a plan for example the futures markets are one of the few investment fields in which employee benefit plans can participate in leveraged strategies without being required to pay tax on “unrelated business taxable income” see “federal income tax consequences — ‘unrelated business taxable income’” at page  in addition because they are not taxpaying entities employee benefit plans are not subject to paying annual tax on profits if any of series j as a matter of policy the managing owner will attempt to limit subscriptions to series j from any employee benefit plan to no more than  of the value of the readily marketable assets of such plan irrespective of the net worth of the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such plan general in general the terms “employee benefit plan” as defined in erisa and “plan” as defined in section  of the code together refer to any plan or account of various types which provide retirement benefits or welfare benefits to an individual or to an employer’s employees and their beneficiaries such plans and accounts include but are not limited to corporate pension and profit sharing plans “simplified employee pension plans” keogh plans for selfemployed individuals including partners individual retirement accounts described in section  of the code and medical plans each plan fiduciary must give appropriate consideration to the facts and circumstances that are relevant to an investment in series j including the role that an investment in such series would play in the plan’s overall investment portfolio each plan fiduciary before deciding to invest in series j must be satisfied that such investment is prudent for the plan that the investments of the plan including the investment in series j are diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses and that an investment in series j complies with the plan and related trust each plan fiduciary considering acquiring units must consult with its own legal and tax advisers before doing so an investment in series j is speculative and involves a high degree of risk series j is not intended as a complete investment program “plan assets” a regulation issued under erisa or the erisa regulation contains rules for determining when an investment by a plan in an entity will result in the underlying assets of such entity being assets of the plan for purposes of erisa and section  of the code ie “plan assets” those rules provide that assets of an entity will not be considered assets of a plan that purchases an equity interest in the entity if certain exceptions apply including i an exception applicable if the equity interest purchased is a “publiclyoffered security” or the publiclyoffered security exception and ii an exception applicable if the investment by all “benefit plan investors” is not “significant” or the significant participation exception a series will rely on the significant participation exception until such time as such series satisfies the conditions of the publiclyoffered security exception series j currently satisfies the conditions of and relies on the exception provided by the publiclyoffered security exception the significant participation exception applies if investments by benefit plan investors are not significant the term “benefit plan investors” includes all plans ie all “employee benefit plans” as defined in and subject to erisa and all “plans” as defined in and subject to section  of the code all “employee benefit plans” and “plans” as defined in but not subject to either erisa or section  of the code and all entities that hold “plan assets” due to investments made in such entities by already described benefit plan investors in addition all or a portion of an investment made by an insurance company using assets from its general account may be treated as a benefit plan investor investments by benefit plan investors will be deemed not significant if benefit plan investors own in the aggregate less than  of the total capital of each class of equity interests in the entity determined by not including the investments of persons with discretionary authority or control over the assets of such entity of any person who provides investment advice for a fee direct or indirect with respect to such assets and “affiliates” as defined in the regulations issued under erisa of such persons    table of contents during any time that series j is relying on the significant participation exception in order to avoid causing assets of series j to be “plan assets” the managing owner intends to restrict the aggregate investment by benefit plan investors to under  of the total capital of each class of equity interests of series j not including the investments of the trustee the managing owner any of the advisors any person who provides investment advice for a fee direct or indirect with respect to the assets of series j and any entity that is directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controlling controlled by or under common control with any of such entities including a partnership or any other similar entity for which the managing owner is the general partner or the functional equivalent thereof or provides investment advice and each of the principals officers and employees of any of the foregoing entities who has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of such entity or of the trust furthermore because the  test is ongoing it not only restricts additional investments by benefit plan investors but also can cause the managing owner to require that existing benefit plan investors withdraw from series j in the event that other investors withdraw if rejection of subscriptions or such mandatory withdrawals are necessary as determined by the managing owner to avoid causing the assets of the trust to be “plan assets” the managing owner will effect such rejections or withdrawals in such manner as the managing owner in its sole discretion determines the publiclyoffered security exception applies if the equity interest is a security that is  “freely transferable”  part of a class of securities that is “widely held” and  either a part of a class of securities registered under section b or g of the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” or b sold to the plan as part of a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act of  the “securities act” and the class of which such security is a part is registered under the exchange act within  days or such later time as may be allowed by the sec after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer in which the offering of such security occurred the erisa regulation states that the determination of whether a security is “freely transferable” is to be made based on all relevant facts and circumstances the erisa regulation specifies that in the case of a security that is part of an offering in which the minimum investment is  or less the following requirements alone or in combination ordinarily will not affect a finding that the security is freely transferable i a requirement that no transfer or assignment of the security or rights in respect thereof be made that would violate any federal or state law ii a requirement that no transfer or assignment be made without advance written notice given to the entity that issued the security and iii any restriction on substitution of an assignee as “a limited partner of a partnership including a general partner consent requirement provided that the economic benefits of ownership of the assignor may be transferred or assigned without regard to such restriction or consent” other than compliance with any of the foregoing restrictions under the erisa regulation a class of securities is “widely held” only if it is of a class of securities owned by  or more investors independent of the issuer and of each other a class of securities will not fail to be widely held solely because subsequent to the initial offering the number of independent investors falls below  as a result of events beyond the issuer’s control the publicly offered security exception applies with respect to units of series j first the units of series j are being sold only as part of a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act and were registered under the exchange act within  days or such later time as allowed by the sec after the end of the fiscal year of such series in which the offering of such units occurred second it appears that units of series j are freely transferable because the minimum investment is not more than  and unitholders may assign their economic interests in such series by giving written notice to the managing owner provided such assignment would not violate any federal or state securities laws and would not adversely affect the tax status of such series as described in the second preceding paragraph the erisa regulation provides that if a security is part of an offering in which the minimum investment is  or less a restriction on substitution of a limited partner of a partnership including a general partner consent requirement will not prevent a finding that the security is freely transferable provided that the economic benefits of ownership can be transferred without such consent although this provision read literally applies only to partnerships the managing owner believes that because the determination as to whether a security is freely transferable is based on the facts and circumstances the fact that the units which are issued by a series of a statutory trust rather than a partnership have an identical restriction should not affect a finding that the series j units are freely transferable    table of contents third the units of series

trading advisor  although multiple commodity trading advisors were used at certain times during the history of the pool the pool may not have been a “multiadvisor pool” as defined by the cftc due to the fact that one of those commodity trading advisors may have been allocated in excess of twentyfive percent of the pool’s funds available for trading  commenced trading as a singleadvisor pool and assets were subsequently allocated to multiple trading advisors the pool is not a “multiadvisorpool” as defined by the cftc for the reason discussed above  commenced trading as a multiadvisor pool and

the managing owner have existed prior to the effective date of ownership october   and performance with respect to such recently purchased pools has been disclosed starting as of october   as applicable    “close date” is the date the pool liquidated its assets and ceased to do business    “aggregate subscript” is the aggregate of all amounts ever contributed to the pool including investors who subsequently redeemed their investments    “current total nav” is the net asset value of the pool as of february   unless otherwise noted as of february      “current nav per unit” is the current net asset value of the pool divided by the total number of units shares outstanding as of february   unless otherwise noted as of february   current nav per unit is based on the value of a hypothetical  unit of investment over time in the case of liquidated pools the nav per unit on the date of liquidation of the pool is set forth    “ worst monthly drawdown” is the largest single month loss sustained since inception of trading “drawdown” as used in this section of the prospectus means losses experienced by the relevant pool over the specified period and is calculated on a rate of return basis ie dividing net performance by beginning equity “drawdown” is measured on the basis of monthly returns only and does not reflect intramonth figures “month” is the month of the  worst monthly drawdown    “ worst peaktovalley drawdown” is the largest percentage decline in the net asset value per unit over the history of the pool this need not be a continuous decline but can be a series of positive and negative returns where the negative returns are larger than the positive returns “ worst peaktovalley drawdown” represents the greatest percentage decline from any monthend net asset value per unit that occurs without such monthend net asset value per unit being equaled or exceeded as of a subsequent monthend for example if the net asset value per unit of a particular pool declined by  in each of january and february increased by  in march and declined again by  in april a “peaktovalley drawdown” analysis conducted as of the end of april would consider that “drawdown” to be still continuing and to be  in amount whereas if the net asset value per unit had increased by  in march the januaryfebruary drawdown would have ended as of the end of february at the  level

a contract to sell a raw or processed commodity and the time he must perform the contract the commodity markets enable the hedger to shift the risk of price fluctuations to the speculator the speculator unlike the hedger generally expects neither to deliver nor receive the physical commodity rather the speculator risks his or her capital with the hope of making profits from price fluctuations in commodity futures contracts speculators such as the trust rarely take or make delivery of the physical commodity but rather close out their futures positions by entering into offsetting purchases or sales of futures contracts the trust does not anticipate taking or making delivery of any physical commodities commodity exchanges commodity exchanges provide centralized market facilities for trading in futures contracts relating to specified commodities each of the commodity exchanges in the united states has an associated “clearinghouse” once trades made between members of an exchange have been confirmed the clearinghouse becomes substituted for the clearing member acting on behalf of each buyer and each seller of contracts traded on the exchange and in effect becomes the other party to the trade thereafter each clearing member firm party to the trade looks only to the clearinghouse for performance clearinghouses do not deal with customers but only with member firms and the “guarantee” of performance under open positions provided by the clearinghouse does not run to customers if a customer’s commodity broker becomes bankrupt or insolvent or otherwise defaults on such broker’s obligations to such customer the customer in question may not receive all amounts owing to such customer in respect of his trading despite the clearinghouse fully discharging all of its obligations the advisors retained by the trust trade on a number of foreign commodity exchanges foreign commodity exchanges differ in certain respects from their united states counterparts and are not subject to regulation by any united states governmental agency accordingly the protections afforded by such regulation are not available to the trust to the extent that it trades on such exchanges in contrast to united states exchanges many foreign exchanges are “principals’ markets” where trades remain the liability of the traders involved and the there is no clearinghouse to become substituted for any party many foreign exchanges also have no position limits with each dealer establishing the size of the positions it will permit individual traders to hold to the extent that the trust engages in transactions on foreign exchanges it is subject to the risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the currencies in which the contracts traded on such foreign exchanges are denominated and united states dollars as well as the possibility that exchange controls could be imposed in the future    table of contents speculative position and daily price fluctuation limits the cftc and the united states exchanges have established limits referred to as “speculative position limits” on the maximum net long or net short position that any person other than a hedger may hold or control in futures contracts or options on futures contracts in particular commodities the principal purpose of speculative position limits is to prevent a “corner” on the market or undue influence on prices by any single trader or group of traders a number of financial markets have replaced “position limits” with “position accountability” and the cash currency markets are not subject to such limits however speculative position limits continue to be applicable in a number of important markets these limits may restrict an advisor’s ability to acquire potentially profitable positions which such advisor otherwise would acquire on behalf of the trust most united states exchanges limit by regulations the maximum permissible fluctuation in commodity futures contract prices during a single trading day these regulations establish what are commonly referred to as “daily limits” daily limits restrict the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price because these limits apply on a daytoday basis they do not limit ultimate losses but may reduce or eliminate liquidity daily limits are generally not applicable to currency futures or to forward contracts margins margins represent a security deposit to assure futures traders’ performance under their open positions when a position is established “margin” is deposited and at the close of each trading day “variation margin” is either credited or debited from a trader’s account representing the unrealized gain or loss on open positions during the day if “variation margin” payments cause a trader’s “margin” to fall below “maintenance margin” levels a “margin call” will be made requiring the trader to deposit additional margin or have his position closed out investment factors investment factors managed futures is a sector of the futures industry made up of professionals or commodity trading advisors ctas who on behalf of their clients manage portfolios made up of futures and forward contracts and related instruments traded around the world utilizing extensive resources markets can be accessed and

diversifying into managed futures allocating a portion of the risk segment of a portfolio to a managed futures investment such as the trust may add a potentially valuable element of diversification to a traditionallystructured portfolio historically over the long term the returns recognized on managed futures investments have been noncorrelated with the performance of stocks and bonds suggesting that a successful managed futures investment may be a valuable complement to a portfolio of stocks and bonds diversifying assets among different investments that generate positive but noncorrelated

which include the barclay cta index are intended to explain managed futures as an asset category and to demonstrate the potential value of allocating a small portion of a portfolio to a managed futures investment such as the trust the barclay cta index is utilized as a broad measure of overall managed futures returns as compared to other indices that measure the overall returns of stocks and bonds as separate asset classes the barclay cta index is not the same as an investment in the trust and the trust may perform quite differently than the index just as an individual stock may perform

any market environment   •   access to global financial and nonfinancial futures markets   •   potential for both reduced volatility andor enhanced returns    table of contents futures and forwards contracts exhibit more risk than stocks or bonds however adding a managed futures fund to a stockandbondonly portfolio has the potential to reduce overall portfolio volatility and enhance returns this potential benefit was initially demonstrated in two key academic works first modern portfolio theory developed by the nobel prize laureate economists drs harry m markowitz and william sharpe asserts that investments having positive returns and low to noncorrelation with each other can improve the riskreward characteristics of the combined holdings in other words a portfolio of different investments with positive returns independent of each other ie noncorrelated can improve the risk profile of an investor’s entire portfolio modern portfolio theory suggests that a portfolio manager should diversify into asset categories that have little or no correlation with the other asset categories in the portfolio the nobel prize for economics in  was awarded to dr harry markowitz for demonstrating that the total return can increase andor risks can be reduced when portfolios have positively performing asset categories that are essentially noncorrelated even an investor who diversifies into international stocks and bonds may not obtain enough noncorrelation over time alternative investment classes such as real estate and international stocks and bonds may correlate closely with domestic equities as the global economy expands and contracts the logical question that then arises is “what investment can add value to a portfolio by enhancing returns and reducing portfolio volatility” historically managed futures investments have had very little correlation to the stock and bond markets the managing owner believes that the performance of the trust should also exhibit a substantial degree of noncorrelation not however necessarily negative correlation with the performance of traditional equity and debt portfolio components unlike short selling in the securities markets selling futures short is no more difficult than establishing a long position the profit and loss potential of futures trading is not dependent upon economic prosperity or interest rate or currency stability diversifying assets among different investments that generate positive but noncorrelated returns has the potential to decrease risk without a corresponding decrease in returns — enhancing the rewardrisk profile of a portfolio as demonstrated in the graphs below noncorrelation will not provide any diversification advantages unless the noncorrelated assets are outperforming other portfolio assets and there is no guarantee that the trust will outperform other sectors of the portfolio or not produce losses additionally although adding managed futures funds to a portfolio may provide diversification managed futures funds are not a hedging mechanism and there is no guarantee that managed futures funds will appreciate during periods of inflation or stock and

the variables tend to move in opposite directions while a positive number implies the variables move in the same direction noncorrelated performance is not negatively correlated performance managing owner has no expectation that the performance of the trust will be inversely related to that of the general debt and equity markets ie likely to be profitable when the latter are unprofitable or viceversa noncorrelation means only that the performance of the trust has in managing owner’s judgment a substantial likelihood of being unrelated to the performance of equities and debt instruments reflecting managing owner’s belief that certain factors which affect equity and debt prices may affect the trust differently and that certain factors which affect the former may not affect the latter the net asset value per unit may decline or increase more or less than equity and debt instruments during both bear and bull markets in his landmark study dr john lintner of harvard university was the first of many to demonstrate specifically that adding a managed futures component to a portfolio can enhance returns dr lintner concluded that a portfolio of judicious investments in stocks bonds and managed futures “   shows substantially less risk at every possible level of expected return than portfolios of stocks or stocks and bonds alone” this diversification effect of managed futures is also demonstrated by looking at the performance of managed futures compared to that of us stocks us bonds and international stocks during a major decline when measured against a decline in the stock and bond markets managed futures has the ability to provide portfolio diversification due to its noncorrelation to stocks and bonds this does not mean that the returns of managed futures are negatively

the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of series j’s investment activities credit risk market risk trading in futures and forward contracts including foreign exchange involves entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a particular commodity at a specified date and price the gross or face amount of the contracts which is typically many times that of series

contractual commitment to sell commodities it must make delivery of the underlying commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contracts at prevailing market prices or settle in cash since the repurchase price to which a commodity can rise is unlimited entering into commitments to sell commodities exposes series j to unlimited risk market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors

clearinghouses are backed by their corporate members who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and as such should significantly reduce this credit risk in cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members ie some foreign exchanges it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions on the other hand there is concentration risk on forward transactions entered into by series j as series j’s clearing broker is the sole counterparty series j has entered into a master netting agreement with its clearing broker and as a result when applicable presents unrealized gains and losses on open forward positions as a net amount in the statement of financial condition the amount at risk associated

series j’s contracts may result in greater loss than nonperformance on all of series j’s contracts there can be no assurance that any counterparty clearing member or clearinghouse will meet its obligations to series j the managing owner attempts to minimize both credit and market risks by requiring series j and its commodity trading advisors to abide by various trading limitations and policies the managing owner monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies which include but are not limited to executing and clearing all trades with creditworthy counterparties limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined and generally limiting transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the

associated with the derivative instruments and related markets in which it invested these risks included but were not limited to risk of loss from fluctuations in the value of derivative instruments held market risk and the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the trading vehicle’s investment activities credit risk     a market risk trading in futures and forward contracts including foreign exchange involves entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a particular commodity at a specified date and price the gross or face amount of the contracts which was typically many times that of the trading vehicle’s net assets being traded significantly exceeded the trading vehicle’s future cash requirements since the trading vehicle intended to close out its open positions prior to settlement as a result the trading vehicle was generally subject only to the risk of loss arising from the change in the value of the contracts as such the trading vehicle considered the “fair value” of its derivative instruments to be the net unrealized gain or loss on the contracts the market risk associated with the trading vehicle’s commitments to purchase commodities was limited to the gross or face amount of the contract held however when the trading vehicle entered into a contractual commitment to sell commodities it had to deliver the underlying commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash since the repurchase price to which a commodity can rise is unlimited entering into commitments to sell commodities exposed the trading vehicle to unlimited risk market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including government programs and policies political and economic events the level and volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the diversification effect among the derivative instruments the trading vehicle held and the liquidity and inherent volatility of the markets in which the trading vehicle traded    f table of contents wmt iii series gj trading vehicle llc notes to financial statements continued       note  derivative instruments and associated risks continued     b credit risk when entering into futures and forward contracts the trading vehicle was exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract would not meet its obligations the counterparty for futures contracts traded on united states and most foreign futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange in general a clearinghouse is backed by its corporate members who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and as such should significantly reduce this credit risk in cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members ie some foreign exchanges it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions on the other hand there was a concentration risk on forward transactions entered into by the trading vehicle as ubs ag was the sole counterparty the trading vehicle entered into a master netting agreement dated november   with ubs ag and as a result when applicable presented unrealized gains and losses on open forward positions as a net amount in the statement of financial condition the amount at risk associated with counterparty nonperformance of all of the trading vehicle’s contracts is the net unrealized gain included in the statement of financial condition however counterparty nonperformance on only certain of the trading vehicle’s contracts may result in greater loss than nonperformance on all of the trading vehicle’s contracts there could be no assurance that any counterparty clearing member or clearinghouse would meet its obligations to the trading vehicle the managing member attempted to minimize both credit and market risks by requiring the trading vehicle and its trading advisor to abide by various trading limitations and policies preferred monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies which include but are not limited to executing and clearing all trades with creditworthy counterparties limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined and generally limiting transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions additionally pursuant to the advisory agreement among the trading vehicle preferred and the trading advisor the trading vehicle shall automatically terminate the advisory agreement if the net asset value allocated to the trading advisor declined as of the end of any business day by at least  from the value at the beginning of any calendar year or since the effective date of the advisory agreement the decline in net asset value is after giving effect for distributions subscriptions and redemptions the trading vehicle’s futures commission merchant in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts was required by commodity futures trading commission “cftc” regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the trading vehicle all assets of the trading vehicle relating to domestic futures trading and was not allowed to commingle such assets with its other assets at december   date of termination and  such segregated assets totaled  and  respectively part  of the cftc regulations also required the trading vehicle’s futures commission merchant to secure assets
