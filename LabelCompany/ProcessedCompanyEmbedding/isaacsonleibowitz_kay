on to enjoy a successful business career serving in senior executive positions at companies such as procter  gamble esmark and also running his own marketing consultancy his years of business travels around the world gave him a firsthand taste of the plight of children in developing countries and made a lasting impression in  harry had a vision for the world of children when he was recovering from cancer surgery at age  watching the pulitzer prize announcements on television he realized that though there was a pulitzer for art and literature a nobel prize for the sciences and peace and an oscar for motion pictures there were no awards for those who were tirelessly serving vulnerable children that realization was a catalyst for harry and he subsequently founded the world of children and pledged to dedicate the rest of his life to creating an awards program to support heroes serving vulnerable children worldwide harry’s honors include the procter  gamble alumni humanitarian award in
