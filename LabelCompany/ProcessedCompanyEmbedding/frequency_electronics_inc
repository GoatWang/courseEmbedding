july    pm edt vote up a a a mitchel field ny july   globe newswire  frequency electronics inc nasdaqfeim reported revenues of  million for fiscal  which ended april   compared to revenues of  million for fiscal   operating loss for fiscal  was  million compared to operating profit of  million for fiscal   net loss for fiscal  was  million or  per diluted share compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share for fiscal  fiscal  results include the effects of  million of onetime noncash charges related to the companys previously reported phase out from its wireline network infrastructure business it is no secret that the satellite industry has been facing stiff headwinds  as a result various levels of the supply chain have suffered and remain challenged today  over the past two years our major customers have seen certain parts of their satellite business decline by half  some of this decline is cyclical in nature while a portion is driven by technological innovation that while ultimately of benefit to fei in the near term is merely a contributor to further delays in revenue  feis satellite payload business has encountered negatively impacted revenue and bookings in the most recent quarters however we have taken aggressive action internally to mitigate the financial impact of the end market weakness while positioning the company to maximize value in the future  moreover our most recent results in feiny are not indicative of the going forward potential of that business area and do not tell the whole story of frequency electronics our largest customers in feis satellite business still indicate an improving outlook for the balance of calendar  and into  suggesting a potential for an upturn in contract awards that would manifest in accelerating bookings and revenue for fei additionally this past year feizyfer achieved strong revenue growth of over  driven by traction in our secure communications business a key driver of the future value of frequency as a whole  as we have articulated in the past the addressable opportunity in secure communications is vast and dovetails well with our engineering capabilities and proven expertise in gps applications feis expertise in precision time technology is key to success in this market we believe the longterm prospects of frequency electronics are bright  we are optimistic that the cyclical downturn in the satellite payload business has run its course and that fei will begin to reap more than its fair share of the overdue recovery  secure communications will prove to be a forceful driver of future revenue and profitability for the company with that said we are not standing idly by and waiting for business to walk in the door  management has taken and will continue to take aggressive action to best position the company to maximize value for our shareholders  as detailed below we have initiated certain actions internally to optimize the operations and the balance sheet assets internal restructuring initiatives inventory in the most recent quarter we took the following actions to better position fei for future value creation—  million of inventory reserves at feizyfer related to the companys phase out of the wireline predominately copper network infrastructure business area and the intended sale of its gillamfei gillam subsidiary     million of inventory reserves at feiny the above reserves have been recorded in cost of goods sold  gillam as previously announced we are actively working to effect a sale of feis gillam subsidiary to an external buyer  gillam is being reported as a held for sale discontinued operation  the company anticipates concluding the disposition of its interest in gillam by the end of this fiscal  the results of gillam for fiscal years ended april   and  are presented as discontinued operations herewith and in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income included in the companys k to be filed for fiscal  feielcom we are working to consolidate certain of feielcoms capabilities with other feiny operations in an effort to reduce costs and improve working capital management  this should have the collateral benefit of providing engineering efficiencies and better customer coverage feiny cost reduction  inventory management initiatives we continue to rightsize the feiny subsidiary in response to the end market weakness while at the same time best positioning fei to capture the eventual recovery in business  although these actions include headcount reductions we have taken steps to ensure that these reductions will have no effect on the companys ability to provide on time delivery for present contractual obligations and to fully achieve its internal research and development objectives we are also in the process of implementing a variety of improved operating disciplines designed to optimize the organization and better position the company to generate larger margins and enhanced inventory turns when our satellite end markets recover the above initiatives are beginning to take effect at this time and will continue to roll out during the balance of the current and next fiscal year  cost reductions already put in place during this past year permitted the company to generate positive cash flow from operations for fiscal  despite the large cyclical decline in satellite business  while it is difficult to provide a precise estimate due to the variability of the revenue line we are targeting over  million of additional cost reductions during fiscal  fiscal  selected financial metrics and other items net positive cash flow from operations increased to  million in fiscal  compared to  million in the prior year for the year ended april   revenues from satellite payloads were approximately  of consolidated revenues compared to  for the prior year fiscal  revenues from satellite programs the companys largest business area decreased by  million or  compared to the prior fiscal year  this decrease is in line with the protracted industry wide slowdown in commercial communications satellite procurement and reflects reductions in orders received from satellite service providers by the companys major customers sales revenues from nonspace us governmentdod customers increased by approximately  million or  compared to prior fiscal year these revenues accounted for approximately  and  of consolidated revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively for the year ended april   other commercial and industrial sales accounted for approximately  of

located in garden grove california feiasia ltd located in the free trade zone in tianjin china fei and its subsidiaries are major worldwide suppliers of precision time and frequency ptf products for ground seaborne airborne and space terminals and platforms used by commercial and governmentmilitary systems suppliers in the mids the company transformed itself from a defense contract manufacturer into a hightech provider of precision time and frequency products used to synchronize voice data and video transmissions in wireless communications systems these systems are found in both groundbased stations and onboard commercial satellites the company also continues to support the united states government with products for defense or space applications but it will do so with more emphasis on cots commercial offtheshelf products than on contractbased projects corporate governance at frequency electronics inc code of business conduct and ethics compliance program audit committee charter of frequency electronics inc primary product categories terrestrial wireless wireline network synchronization spacebased fei government systems inc feigsi click to learn more about feis space technology subsidiary terrestrial wireless the telecommunications industry is rapidly expanding with new or improved technologies being developed to provide ever more services to the public growing digital cellular systems and pcs networks require more base stations to provide the connectivity and quality of service that cell phone users require cellular infrastructure original equipment manufacturing companies consisting of some of the worlds largest telecommunications companies are building out existing networks even as they develop new technologies such as edge and g systems to provide not only improved voice connectivity but also internet video and data transmission with increased demand for cellular services but limited bandwidth the requirement for precise timing becomes paramount fei manufactures small rubidium vapor atomic oscillators as well as temperature stable quartz crystal oscillators which are ideally suited for use in advanced cellular communications base stations whether the network uses cdma code division multiple access tdma time division multiple access or gsm global system for mobile communications or a hybrid such as edge timing to ensure signal synchronization is of the essence wireline network synchronization todays worldwide digital telephone network infrastructure operates on the time division multiplexing tdm protocol tdm requires accurate and reliable synchronization systems called tsgs timing signal generators or synonymously ssus sync supply units fei is a major supplier of next generation microprocessor controlled tsgs to network operators worldwide not only does the backbone voice network require precise timing at every stage of switching multiplexing and relay but data transmission is also critically dependent on precise synchronization data carried on the fiber optic sonet network is subject to the same exacting timing requirements as traditional voice traffic ip packetbased communication may be asynchronous but it is delivered over the common tdm network infrastructure new timing requirements are in standards development clocks will be integral to the operation of voice data and internet networks for the foreseeable future fei offers a portfolio of network synchronization productsall software manageable precisely accurate reliable and durable the flagship product is the usga the state of the art in central office synchronization technology the usge is targeted for carriers that operate in the europeaninternational network environment the usgm retains most of the features and functions of the a model but is designed for smaller switching and transit node applications it features an integrated gps receiver enabling it to provide a selfcontained stratum  reference for distribution within its service location fei has recently introduced another innovative product the unisync prs this is a compact gps receiver system that can provide a stratum  signal reference to a colocated tsg or if needed can serve as a timing distributor for up to twelve network elements in a very small office fei also offers a very powerful serverbased element management system ems lynx is capable of monitoring and managing a network of several hundred clock systems and to proactively detect the degradation of synchronization quality before a costly and disruptive system failure occurs these systems have been evaluated tested and deployed by several of the largest telecom network operators in the world spacebased the commercial use of satellites launched for communications navigation weather forecasting video and data transmissions has led to the increased need and ability to transmit information to earth based receivers this requires precise timing and frequency control of the satellite systems for example fei has provided the following products to the satellite industry  master clocks quartz crystal oscillators and rubidium vapor atomic oscillators  rfchains  frequency
