log in     middlefield rdste palo alto ca    same as before but better in and out without fuss best blood draw in memory my veins are hard to find but not here nice new modern facility very nice vibe most clean tranquil  speedy and painless blood draw experience ever i made an appointment and was in and out in less than  minutes from start to finish rodel was very polite cheerful and great at drawing blood  even after i started to faint he kept me from falling and revived me back to full health there was no one else in there at am and i was inandout with  waiting super convenient and fast definitely recommend coming here place is sooooooo slow only one guy works here and i called earlier to try to make an appointment and the guy said they dont take appointments and to just walk in then i come in and youre basically waiting forever unless you have an appointment in which case you wait a little less than forever freaking ridiculous lab corp  channing rd is my goto lab the phlebotomist is great and she gets the job done right the first time which is important when you have to go for recurring bloodwork she is very experienced weve been going to this site  welch rd before that just to see her i love this office fast efficient highly qualified woman working there people complain she isnt friendly i like her and shes very smart also excellent at her job i wrote a blog post about her and according to analytics it has been read by other labs and medical centers as to what the place looks like  looks fine to me you want more youll pay more it is functional and clean note to yelp you have the zip code wrong it isnt  it is  i havent been there in about  months so i hope i am giving the thumbs up to the right person horrible i will never use this lab ever again  i arrived and signed in at  for an  appointment another patient arrived at the same time she did not have an appointment we were there for the same routine lab tests and she was taken ahead of me why bother making an appointment  the tech collected my blood and vigorously shook the tubes i had not seen this before the following is the correct procedure for collecting blood according to the website of another lab whole blood the tube must be filled completely and gently inverted at least  times immediately after drawing do not shake the tube shaking may cause hemolysis and result in specimen rejection  multiple urine samples including mine were left unattended in the bathroom on the back of the toilet they were not secured or supervised very fast i was in and out in  minutes and i did not have an appointment however the place was difficult to find it is not on middlefield but channing theres no way you can access the place through middlefield a new office building obstructs the old middlefield road entrance they should change the address to channing fast and efficient i had a friday  am appointment i got there early at  and i was processed and out by  the test results came through the following morning the woman doing the paperwork and tests didnt say much but she was professional efficient and seemed experienced it all seemed good to me the woman who works here and it seems shes the entire staff appears to be the same person who worked at the labcorp at the old welch road location the good news she appears to be an experienced phlebotomist she draws blood efficiently and painlessly the bad news as others have noted she gives off a very unhappy vibe all i can think is that she hates her job hates her customers and wishes she was anywhere but at work clearly it doesnt seem to bother labcorp as theyve obviously invested zero dollars in training her in any semblance of customer service skills okay so the person at the front desk isnt always the friendliest but theyve been holed up by themselves all day once the paperwork is done and youre starting your lab work it goes quickly and painlessly the place is clean however the bathroom always has issues either you cant use the sink or the toilet has to be flushed  times but i still like this place because the ease of their billing process makes it all worth it they bill your insurance and they know how to bill so you dont get a million calls and letters i was in the other day getting my blood drawn and i had to take a call from my doctor in the middle of all of it and next thing i know im done didnt feel a thing and the young lady was kind as could be even after i was rude and on my cell the whole time quick clean convenient and fast would not suggest showing up at  when they open because they are busy checking email and ignoring customers creating a huge pileup first thing in the morning this place is staffed only by one person and shes not the friendliest would recommend going to another labcorp if you can do so conveniently i had a horrible time at this place it is so small it can only hold  people in its waiting room and the receptionist was very rude and could barely speak english i had to take a drug test by pm for my job and i took it at pmi almost didnt make it because the place is so unprofessional jury is out on this place personally i was unimpressed by the facility there were  people in the waiting room which can only accommodate  people and  employee who is the receptionist specimen collector blood draw technician etc seemed like more of a flybynight deal than a serious lab i am shocked that this place has negative reviews but after closer inspection the reviews were from a few years ago i suspect things have changed since those reviews were posted i have come here twice and i am always pleased both times i have been here there has only been one person working sedique and she is great very good plebotomist she hits the vein perfectly every time she is very efficient and fast too so i am in and out quick i am a community provider and i send patients to labcorp at the middlefield rd location i am surprised by the negative reviews because i have not had many complaints about them from my patients i am able to get results online and quickly send them to my patients via fax or email as a provider i would suggest that labcorp work quickly to automate the requisition process as well as the results process it is important to be able to order labs online instead of having multiple page requisitions also staff should be trained to make sure that providers have given a diagnosis code at the time of requisition so that the provider does not get bothered on the back end when the lab is ready to bill quest and labcorp are pretty similar it seems when i speak to my patients first experience with labcorp was a mess they misplaced my lab results and it took my physicians office a couple days to locate them my doctor recently told me that they have a been a disaster in terms of billing with lots of problems labcorp took over most of the stanford hospital labs and they have gone downhill faster than an avalanche pathetic outsourcing stanford should be ashamed make sure to use the labs that are still stanford operated one is in the hospital itself and the other is in the blake wilbur building i had a am appointment and arrived about  minutes early the lady working said she was finishing up with another client and it would be just a few minutes sure enough a few minutes later we went over my paperwork she made a copy of insurance info and inside i went the process was fairly efficient the waiting room is small and if there were people waiting it might have been annoying since there is only one staffer i suppose it could get backed up but if you make an appointment you should be fine the patient log didnt seem that full and it didnt seem like many people had to wait too long in the morning efficient and quick just dropped in and was out in minutes im surprised by the  negative reviews below ive been at labcorp several times since  and found it quick and easy ive been a patient at pamf for  years and used to go to their lab but after they moved to the building on el camino in  or  i found the wait to average  min for a phlebotomist often with an attitude no way would i waste time waiting in their small basement room now plus i have a highdeductible health care plan and have to pay cash for my labs so i actually save some money by getting my labs done at labcorp instead of pamf ive also had blood drawn at stanford hospital and had  negative experiences the first time i walked out after waiting for  min and listening to the phlebotomists argue over which tubes to use speaking of incompetence and another time i was stabbed in the arm x by one person before someone competent replaced her and got blood from another vein in all the years of getting blood draws that was the only time someone didnt get blood at the first stick i have very accessible arm veins i ended up with an ugly hematoma for a few days where the incompetent stanford lab person had stabbed me labcorp unclaimed this business has not yet

good news she appears to be an experienced phlebotomist she draws blood efficiently and painlesslythe bad news as others have noted she gives off a very unhappy vibe all i can think is that she hates

am able to get results online and quickly send them to my patients via fax or email as a provider i would suggest that labcorp work quickly to automate the requisition process as well as the results process it is important to be able to order labs online instead of having multiple page requisitionsalso staff should be trained to make sure that providers have given a diagnosis code at the time of requisition so that the provider does not get bothered on the back end when the lab is ready to billquest and labcorp are pretty similar it seems when i speak to my patients was this review … useful

minutes  sure enough a few minutes later we went over my paperwork she made a copy of insurance info and inside i went  the process was fairly efficient  the waiting room is small and if there were people waiting it might have been annoying  since there is only one staffer i suppose it could get backed up but if you make an appointment you should be fine  the patient log didnt seem that full and it didnt seem like many people had to wait too long in the morning was this review … useful  funny cool don b san carlos ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message

embed review compliment send message follow see b stop following see b  im surprised by the  negative reviews below ive been at labcorp several times since  and found it quick and easy ive been a patient at pamf for  years and used to go to their lab but after they moved to the building on el camino in  or  i found the wait to average  min for a phlebotomist often with an attitude  no way would i waste time waiting in their small basement room now  plus i have a highdeductible health care plan and have to pay cash for my labs so i actually save some money by getting my  labs done at labcorp instead of pamf ive also had blood drawn at stanford hospital and had  negative experiences the first time i walked out after waiting for  min and listening to the phlebotomists argue over which tubes to use speaking of incompetence and another time i was stabbed in the arm x by one person before someone competent replaced her and got blood from another vein  in all the years of getting blood draws that was the only time someone didnt get blood at the first stick i have very accessible arm veins  i ended up with an ugly hematoma for a few days where the incompetent stanford lab person had stabbed me was this review … useful  funny cool page  of   other reviews that are not currently recommended you might also consider ad brian w fong dmd  reviews  miles away from labcorp

minutes but that wasnt a big deal when they returned i was up first and it took me about two minutes to get checked in and another two to get called back in and out in twenty minutes counting the ten i waited most importantly the phlebotomist was good with the needle it barely hurt all good labcorp has two locations in mountain view this location does not seem as busy as the one on grant road i was able to book a am appointment online the night before i showed up a few minutes early and was out of there by  nicky checked me in then did the blood draw she is an excellent phlebotomist they take walkins but recommend making an appointment was an ok experience my doctor didnt make the lab orders particularly clear so it took a long time for the phlebotomist to get everything coded into the computer she was trying her best but was unable to do some of the tests even after being on the phone for  minutes there really should be at least  people in here one doing the tests one working at the front etc she was quick and efficient with the blood draw but as others had mentioned it didnt seem super clean i prefer pamf when i can go nicky was really nice and if you get anxious about blood draws they have an area where you can lay down and get the blood drawn this is the best location in the south bay for blood draws i cannot say enough amazing things about this location after a loyal quest customer for  years i decided to give labcorp a try out of my frustrations with quest and boy its been such a pleasant change things i like about labcorp  walk in wait time no more than

marina dubkin works here although my interactions with all staff at labcorp mtn view have been pleasant marina has been by far amazing she goes an extra mile she is willing to work over time she was with me till  mins after close time today  much of it related to the fact i came in the nick of time and my physician kept changing her requests and put up with erratic requests from my physicians she added a lab order last minute to my list of tests after my physician wanted one more test added  mind you all this was well over time also her blood draw skills are superb i never felt anything i wish she worked here everyday to summarize go to labcorp mtn view for your lab needs and if you have a chance go when marina is working in and out in  mins the front desk lady can be more welcoming but im here for blood work which the phlebologist handled well on top of it all it was damn quick went in on saturday morning at  saw nicky today for my huge blood draw she was amazing one of the best draws

was seen and back in my car before my original appointment time if that isnt impressive i dont know what is the cherry on top was that my blood test actually was painless sometimes they say now youre going to feel a little poke and its a brutal insanely painful attack on your arm not this time a to the woman who did my test she was quick friendly and efficient easy to find lots of parking and i had minimal wait as a walk in patient i signed in and within  minutes i was seen clean facility professional phlebotomistsan overall nice experience as far as blood giving goes my advice get there just when it opens i have always arrived here at  am as soon as they open everything from billing to sample collection is fast and efficient as well as painless highly recommend this location pretty terrible wait time if you come first thing in the morning get ready to wait  minutes to an hour they are not very nice either and are unable to clearly state how much they would expect me to pay made an appointment on line for a monday morning came here  the doors were locked hardly anyone in the parking lot  thought they were closed maybe a holiday or something after  minutes someone from inside their office saw me standing outside came  unlocked the door went to the correct suite where the lab was located small little holeinthewall place that did not look much like a medical facility no one else was there when inquired about whether people were coming in the gal at the desk said yes informed her that the doors were locked  couldnt get in she said that maybe someone accidentally locked doors while exiting you cant accidentally lock the doors bc these doors open up automatically when you approach them  the switch to lock the doors is well above the average persons height the same person at the front desk doing the paperwork is the same person drawing the blood in the lab the blood drawing room is one small dingy room with one chair it did not look very sanitary cleaned the gal who drew my blood did not change gloves she wore the same glove taking my paperwork  drawing my blood even though i was late for the appointment because i couldnt get in there was no waiting got in  out of there in  minutes no other issues encountered order blood tests  paid for them online thru direct labs got my results within  hours fast  quick and easy and reasonable as well glad i did not get the blood work done at the hospital or through quest diagnostic which is another story went there the other day for a blood test things were smooth the receptionistnurse was really helpful and the procedure was painless finding out the place was a little difficult on the scale of fun getting a blood test ranks pretty high right next to having a car run over your foot or getting poked in the eye by a circus midget so when my doctor said i should get a blood test i could hardly contain my enthusiasm though the labcorp branch in sunnyvale is closer to me i went with the mountain view branch because of its better reviews the office is on the ground floor of a small medical complex parking was ample making an appointment online can be helpful but in my case i arrived at am without one and there was only one person ahead of me at  i was asked to take a seat in the chair of fun and in a few minutes the nurse was about to initiate the ritual blood sacrifice how much this process hurts depends largely on the skill of the person performing it sometimes the person will prick you a few times with the needle trying to find the vein thats the worst my nurse certainly knew her craft and put the needle in smoothly it felt like nothing more than a pinch and before i could say hemoglobin  times the blood draw was over and she was putting gauze over my arm alas our blood test fun was too short i cant wait till the next time my doctor says i need a blood test so i can come back to labcorp mountain view same person doing the signup and blood draw but given that there was nobody else in line i dont see that as a problem she changed gloves before the draw pretty painless i did have to wait about  minutes after my appointment time though the gal who took my blood was nice and very caring i have a tendency to faint and she quickly moved me to a place to lie down and was nice about accommodating me they were quick we went in just before  pm and there was no wait which shocked me i was super nervous about coming here since some lab corps had really negative reviews this place was awesome got there around am waited about ten minutes was in and out in a heartbeat the actual blood draw was smooth and the woman who drew my blood was so chill i was wriggling and panicky but she is such a pro i went in scared and left smiling because it was such a pleasant experience  minutes or less and youre done benefits  nurse is a pro and has done blood draws so many times that its near painless when she draws blood  friendly staff  quick and easy  reiterate number  worst experience i was fasting didnt take an appointment and i went there around am i saw four people ahead of me so i thought would make it by am only one person working she takes care of insurance and goes to the lab and takes the test on an average  mins per patient no complaints about her she is doing her best after  patients another comes from outside and says he has an appointment so no wait time for him she immediately takes him i just couldnt take it with this speed ill not be done by am as well felt very bad and left i cannot believe the fact that even drs appointment takes  mins and just for blood test you have to wait for an hour theres huge flaw in the system this has become my goto place for blood work ive been on three separate occasions and have worked with two different technicians i am a hard draw and really appreciated that the techs were adept and left me with no bruising there was little to no wait each time plus the blood draw room and adjacent bathroom sample time were both wellorganized and clean good place to go for routine blood work i made an appointment i arrived about  minutes early and there was another person just finishing up after a very short

access to labcorp test results online i have only been there a couple of times the most recent one made me feel very bad the assistant lady had a bad attitude toward me simply because i tried to check the signin sheet omg run as far away from this place as you can this is a shady dingy corner off prospect road that has very unfriendly and aggressive staff they first ask you to sign in and give them your credit card before they will even answer a simple question like whether they accept my insurance or not when i showed them the doctors prescription and asked about the approximate out of pocket cost of the blood procedures their best response was first give us your credit card info then we will draw blood and then answer questions terrible way to treat a prospective customer i bolted this is a very shady location for few reasons  the staff is not pleasant to deal with  they ask you for your credit card information which ive never had to give at my other labcorp locations  the building looks very old and the office looks very unorganizedunsanitary  i have really good veins but it took the guy  tries to find my veins i never have this problem at other locations i think labcorp needs to train this locations staff all over i would avoid coming to this location if i were you the office is small dingy and disorganized i felt awkward and uncomfortable getting a medical procedure preformed here i waited  minutes after my appointment how awkward there was no privacy for the patients whatsoever every patient waiting could hear everything said anywhere in the tiny office we could quite plainly hear even the goings on of the restroom when they collected a urine sample the bathroom was right next to the waiting room how uncomfortable the lab tech had no respect for privacy
