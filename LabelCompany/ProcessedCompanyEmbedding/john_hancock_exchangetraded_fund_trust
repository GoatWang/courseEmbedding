decline in the value of an investment acquired through leverage while the fund’s obligations under such leverage remain fixed the risk that the fund will have to sell securities in a volatile market in order to meet asset coverage or other debt compliance requirements fund returns will be lower if the cost of the leverage exceeds the income or capital appreciation derived from securities purchased with leverage if the fund is unable to obtain replacement financing in the event the cfa is terminated the fund would be required to sell securities at a potentially inopportune time incurring tax consequences and its ability to generate income would be adversely affected the fund’s quarterly distributions may be from net investment income capital gains or return of capital the
