for live sports and television apr    et from rabbletv nashville tenn april   prnewswire  rabbletv today announced the official launch of its free communitydriven live audio streaming website and app targeted at sports and television fans rabble lets users create and find alternative audio options for their favorite sports and tv shows visit rabble on the web at wwwrabbletv rabble provides sports fans a unique and interactive way to experience game day with their favorite teams instead of listening to the canned network audio users can hear games broadcast by actual fans – or they can chose to broadcast the games themselves theres a groundswell of sports fans who are tired of national sportscasters spouting cliches as they emotionlessly call games that matter to us said cofounder ryan tyrrell rabble allows fans to take charge of their game experience by giving them the ability to create or listen to live broadcasts from fans just as passionate as they are rabble is more than just an audio platform – its audio democracy rather than attempting to replace existing network anchors with another stable of professional broadcasters rabble has opened their broadcast platform to the public and will allow anyone to broadcast on their site users vote on the best content and the community itself determines which broadcasts rise to the top that content may be an alternate audio broadcast of the game of the week or a comedian riffing on an episode of some obscure reality show buried in some dark corner of the cable guide realizing that many television viewers are as fanatical about their favorite shows as sports fans are about the teams they love rabble creators have also built in functionality for users to create broadcasts about movies and shows directly from a builtin television guide rabble was created to meet the communication needs of modern sports and television fans who are already engaging with one another during the games and shows they love via social networking sites message boards and text conversations rabble aims to combine all of these extraneous second screen activities into a single game or show thread with the added benefit of being able to replace or augment the existing audio key features broadcast live commentary to listeners everywhere listen to passionate humorous and informative fancreated commentary on any tv show or sports event game and show threads create an interactive event experience ios mobile companion app enables users to listen from anywhere available for any sports or television event no need to audition or qualify

clothes  more the  best craft breweries in america these custommade backpacks are insanely beautiful the  best watches under  which running headphones should you buy next by now most people understand the concept behind crowdfunding platforms like kickstarter invest in a product and help bring it to market receive the product  simple a similar concept applies to equity crowdfunding except instead of investing in a product people are investing in the company or project itself they’re buying equity and they can start investing for as little as  more tech this new gopro feature automatically edits your videos and makes sharing even easierfive new iphone hacks that will save you timeusb  — what is it and will the iphone  support it previously regulations set by the securities act of  to protect average people from being swindled also prevented those same people from investing in things like small startups funds and real estate basically if they weren’t an accredited investor ie someone with an annual income of  or more they couldn’t invest that changed with title iii of the jobs act which was passed in march  and kicked into effect march  now if projects are open to equity crowd fundraising people can invest in them rabble is a new equity crowdfunding platform that focuses not on real estate of small businesses but on impact investing projects that have a positive social andor environmental impact these projects can be anything from urban farms to renovated buildings basically rabble is a platform that allows people to invest in projects that they actually care about at a minimal cost and earn a return on their investment at the same time at launch rabble is only backing one project century partners a group dedicated to renovating and rebuilding housing units in detroit but more projects will be added to rabble’s site in the future we asked umber bawa founder and ceo of rabble for more on rabble equity crowdfunding and how people can get involved the following interview has been edited for length and clarity q what is equity crowdfunding and why is it new a crowd investment or equity crowdfunding is where people pool their capital to finance a project or company that will yield some financial return it allows people to become investors in projects or companies this differs from donationbased crowdfunding in that “backers” aim to receive some financial return instead of a product or “thank you gift” for different levels of participation what’s new stems from the jobs act recent jobs act rulings represent a transformational shift in securities law for the first time everyday people can invest in private companies it allows companies to raise funds with a less cumbersome process than an ipo and it allows nonaccredited investors to participate in offerings that previously were reserved for highnetworth individuals this can result in innovative firms or projects that get funding from people who believe in the team and mission q among other equity crowdfunding platforms how is rabble unique a most platforms focus either solely on startup companies or on real estate at this time rabble’s focus lies in between these two we seek innovative exciting and sociallyenvironmentally responsible projects that are tied to real assets with strong historical performance for example we would help raise funds to build out an art gallery that has strong leadership has been in existence for some time and has demonstrated an ability to pay back a note in a specified timeframe we list projects that have a clear revenue model are in operation and are doing work that the community at large values one that is good for a neighborhood or the environment very few folks in this arena are emphasizing the impact investing space at this time — however investment is shifting that way as millennials start investing and bringing their cultural attitudes with them at the same time institutional investors are focusing on ways to get involved in socially responsible investing with clear social return — rabble is one way q how is rabble different from investment apps like mint or robinhood a rabble allows you to invest in private companies and project specific ventures you can think of it as private equity or venture capital that is available to anyone q so is rabble an app website or both and how can somebody invest a right now you can access rabble on the web we provide more than just the interface our team vets each project takes the project through the legal approval process and then makes the offering available through our site after the project is up and running we provide the backend to give backersinvestors access to dividend payments in a very sleek easytouse interface all people need to do to get started is to sign up with a usissued photo id link a bank account review the projects and invest q how many projects is rabble linked with at the moment a the first investment is being led by century partners a professional real estate development firm based in detroit michigan they’ve already had success in detroit over the last two years the founders david alade and andrew colom have deployed  million of equity to purchase rehabilitate and lease over  abandoned homes in midtown detroit investors will be investing alongside a new fund managed by century partners and will own a percentage of  homes in the boston edison east english village and north end neighborhoods managed by century partners investors will also be improving detroit in the process by removing blight providing highquality housing to new residents and displacing no people in the process we were connected by a summer intern who recognized one of the founders in an alumni magazine we reached out shared the same mission and couldn’t be happier with their team and what we believe they’ll be able to deliver to investors q when will rabble be involved with more than one project a as soon as we close funding for this first project we have other exciting projects on the way q if a project developer wants to have people invest in their project how would they go about working with rabble a they would submit a project to us via our website we have a way for sponsors to submit projects directly to us there after review we’ll reach out to the project team and if it’s a good fit we will begin the diligence process after diligence and our internal merit review we prepare a filing to get federal approval to issue shares for each project and we list the project on the platform q what types of projects are good fits with rabble what kind of projects are you looking to work with a we have rigorous financial social and environmental impact criteria that each project must pass we also look at the experience of the team in pulling off ventures of similar scale our current focus areas are urban revitalization supporting arts and culture and urban agriculture as we grow our focus will include green building and eventually renewable projects — think a community solar project we’re also thinking of ways to move into small infrastructure q is the  minimum investment exclusive to rabble or is it common throughout equity crowdfunding platforms a we set the barrier to entry at  to make the opportunity accessible to people of all income levels the tagline “investing for all” is meant to represent two things that all the projects we list have benefits for a community at large and that each offering is openaccessible to a broad number of people while we anticipate the majority of investments to be above k per person we wanted to make that option available to be as inclusive as possible most platforms in this space tend to focus on a k minimum fundrise or much higher prodigy network realty mogul cadre technically we could make the minimum investment lower but decided that this was a good entry level for the majority of people q where do you see rabble in five years a this is projected to be a huge industry a recent goldman sachs report estimates the size of equity crowdfunding to be  trillion dollars that’s a greater market size than what’s expected for payments small business lending and student lending combined the industry is young we’re in the early days…rabble wants to become a leader in this space and grow with people as they shift their investing to align with their values we
