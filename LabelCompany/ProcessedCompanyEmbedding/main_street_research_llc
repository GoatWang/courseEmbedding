reserved main street research  invest and protect let’s talk about investment performance… performance is about being active vs passive investment markets are ever changing – our active style allows us to take advantage of opportunities performance is about actively managing risk our active risk management process mitigates losses – thereby enhancing returns performance is also about keeping costs low how do we do this we invest in individual securities from all over the world stocks and bonds so we help you avoid the fees and costs of mutual funds or exchange traded funds etfs take a look under the hood individual securities and transparency by investing in individual securities you see the stocks you own by comparison mutual funds and etfs don’t offer anything close to transparent data invest your personal circumstances goals and wealth planning serve as the basis for our initial strategy and required rates of return the result of our macroeconomic research process completes the investment portfolio’s overall asset allocation macroeconomic history provides great evidence that over long periods of time there is a direct correlation between changes in the economy the business cycle and the performance of financial instruments over the long term the macroeconomic variables that drive the global economy – such as interest rates inflation and corporate profits – affect the longterm direction of stock bond and real estate prices therefore our search for the best opportunities within the investment landscape begins with an understanding of the global economic climate and business cycle global equity management equity selection – a global and disciplined process we believe that great investment opportunities can be found anywhere in the world therefore our research has no geographic boundaries our universe of potential companies exceeds  and covers  countries  sectors and  industry groups the list includes the msci world equity index and russell  index of small companies stock selection process – quantitative and qualitative over the years our research has identified a number of fundamental characteristics that lead to longterm above average stock performance these criteria include a company’s balance sheet strength cash flow profit growth and market share dominance we endeavor to pay a reasonable price for the companies that fit our stringent criteria and accomplish this by correlating stock price valuation with profit growth in an effort to isolate great companies we screen our entire global universe using a proprietary inhouse software model that measures each company in terms of our criteria only the top  companies are considered for purchase and each is arranged by its respective economic sector and industry group those companies in declining industry groups are removed from consideration further reducing our list the final phase of our stock selection involves our own “hands on” research as well as input from our research partners the result of this extensive process yields a short list of companies that we believe are of high quality and possess superior fundamentals and management moreover the final list of companies represents a number of strong industry groups from various countries and multiple market capitalizations diversification is key socially responsible investing since we serve a limited number of clients and manage each client’s portfolio separately we can personally tailor your portfolio to include socially responsible screening based on criteria you provide us this process leverages some of what is in our opinion today’s best technology and research in the field of socially responsible investing this screening can be employed on just a portion of your investments or your entire portfolio tax and cost efficiency… ”its not what you earn its what you keep” we do not believe that investors should sacrifice performance for tax efficiency our goal is to pursue an investment style designed to be highly tax efficient our average portfolio turnover is only  annually – significantly lower than that of most mutual funds according to morningstar most importantly when successful this allows you to retain a greater amount of your assets each year which fosters the longterm compounding of your wealth since our fees are based on the value and performance of your portfolio we are costconscious our use of individual securities as opposed to mutual funds and other investment “products” assists in keeping costs low and can reduce the possibility of hidden or layered fees additionally we work closely with the custodian of your assets in an effort to keep your transaction costs to a minimum mutual fund turnover and taxes bankratecom equity portfolio maintenance and sell disciplines to ensure the continued quality of your investments we monitor each position daily and review each client portfolio weekly in addition we repeat our screening process weekly we sell stocks for a number of reasons including a company no longer meets our criteria the economy changes the sector or industry deteriorates the price exceeds profit growth or there is a change in management additionally our active risk management arm may initiate the sale of a company due to deteriorating fundamentals   global fixed income over one third of our total assets under management are invested in fixed income markets our fixed income investments are dedicated to individual bonds rather than bond funds these positions include us treasury government agency corporate and municipal bonds as an independent advisory firm we have established relationships with over  fixed income brokerdealers this network allows us to search for and purchase fixed income securities at competitive prices which has the potential to enhance your fixed income returns our fixed income allocations are driven by our macroeconomic and interest rate cycle analysis and by your income tax circumstances we have strict credit quality requirements for the bulk of our fixed income management in addition we perform a process we call credit watch to continually monitor potential changes in credit quality of these investments in the selection of corporate fixed income we leverage our work in equity research to isolate opportunities in the corporate bond market depending on client circumstances we may enter the high yield market for a small percentage of the portfolio in order to enhance income typically fixed income is employed to provide supplemental income while mitigating the risk of an allequity portfolio global fixed income alternatives during periods when global equities or traditional fixed income do not represent value our team may employ alternatives to these assets classes these individual securities are intended to be less correlated to the global equity markets while providing above average yield particularly in low interest rate environments depending on client preferences and the economic cycle a welldiversified combination of preferred stock real estate investment trusts and master limited partnerships may offer an alternative solution to investors seeking yield global preferred stock depending on the economic cycle and your circumstances preferred stock may be included in the portfolio to offer both diversification and yield these securities are less correlated to global stock markets and combine features of fixed income and equity instruments as they pay both a fixed dividend and have the potential to appreciate in value global real estate markets depending on the economic cycle and your circumstances real estate investment trusts reits may also be employed these securities trade on open market exchanges such as the new york stock exchange and allow you to participate in the real estate market with the benefit of daily liquidity that owning real estate properties does not offer our macroeconomic research and interest rate cycle analysis along with your tax circumstances drive our reit allocations global master limited partnerships mlps depending on the economic cycle and your circumstances mlps may offer above average yield and provide the liquidity of a publicly traded company these securities derive most of their cash flows from natural resources commodities or real estate which may help complement a portfolio’s diversification sector specific analysis combined with fundamental analysis at the company level allows us to identify opportunities in the mlp space active risk management we believe that successful longterm investment performance is the result of above average investment selection combined with careful risk management our active risk management arm is a process employed to manage potential downside risk due to factors that include global economic instability economic sector or industry weakness and deterioration in a specific security’s fundamentals it includes tools and formulas that can affect a portfolio’s asset allocation sector and stock exposure arm is a process that is continually applied to your investment portfolio depending on the health and stability of financial markets arm may cause your portfolio to experience periods of reduced exposure to particular sectors industries or individual securities as well as increased cash and fixed income balances though risk management does not guarantee against investment loss we believe that over the long run our arm process mitigates risk and leads to above average investment results privacy policy terms of use
