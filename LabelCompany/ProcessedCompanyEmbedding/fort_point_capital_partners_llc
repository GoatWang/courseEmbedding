losses is the key to superior return outcomes   this chart is constructed solely to illustrate the hypothetical investment gains required to recoup investment losses and should not be construed as actual backtested or anticipated returns for fort point capital partners llc bull markets are not guaranteed the timing or sequence of returns is the least predictable and consequently the biggest variable in defining investment success if your retirement or spending years start off in a bear market your lifetime compounded return experience can be materially impaired with exhaustion of your capital base being a very real possibility by contrast a riskmanaged portfolio can fare well in both bear and bull markets   this chart is designed to show the hypothetical effects of options overlay strategies during a market cycle that starts bearish and eventually turns bullish this is not actual fort point or market performance information bonds are no longer a safe harbor while more people are nearing retirement than ever before the rates of return on standard “safe” investments such as bonds are currently negative after accounting for the impact of inflation   httpswwwstlouisfedorg   your “diversified” portfolio isn’t really diversified volatility is the only real asset class while you may believe that you own a “diversified” portfolio it is likely that you have exposure to a variety of asset classes that have in the past and will likely in the future experience a severe coordinated loss event   our approach consistent and predictable outcomes require both broadbased diversification and options strategies that firmly mitigate risk in effect treating volatility as an asset class we seek to improve portfolio returns by managing risk capture most of the upside and less of the downside by limiting your losses even slightly you can outperform over time without capturing  of the upside market moves  this is accomplished by creating return asymmetry — trading some upside participation in exchange for an unequal downside protection benefit it is through this return asymmetry that consistent investment success can be realized   this chart is intended to show hypothetical risk and return metrics for an investor who uses options overlays to effect hisher overall market performance capture ratio low volatility wins over time even if your average annual return is the same every year over the course of  years you’ll see that a less volatile portfolio substantially outperforms a more volatile one   these returns are hypothetical constructed to illustrate the impact of volatility and should not be construed as actual backtested or anticipated results for fort point capital partners llc our investment philosophy total portfolio thinking we take a totally integrated portfolio approach in which all decisions are made in the context of the aggregate portfolio the goal is to achieve extensive diversification across many return sources with each portfolio component “big enough to matter small enough not to hurt” convert volatility into an asset volatility control is a core objective not an abstract concept volatility exposes portfolios to more frequent and deeper periods of negative returns requiring greater amounts of positive portfolio performance to recover  specifically we use option overlay strategies to actively manage portfolio risk and deliver a source of reliable alpha in uncertain markets early to derisk  early to rerisk the best time to reduce exposure is when an asset is expensive and risk seems low the best time to increase exposure is when an asset is cheap and risk looms large easy to say yet hard to do in the absence of a structured systematic objective investment process the team fort point was
