president and ceo frank slootman took over from founder fred luddy in  after selling his previous company data domain to emc and dipping his toe into venture capital he spoke with fortune about why the concept of service management is catching on outside it departments his words have been condensed and edited for length and claritydefine service management especially for the nonit personrelatedenterprise technologyxerox  years of history in  imagesenterprise technologyxerox  years of history in  imagesif you call a service provider with an issue whether you want something or you have a problem where you need information people start scurrying around and trying to deal with your issue you get that when you talk to human resources or facilities—youve lost your badge or you want to change your k allocations its a very peoplebased business but essentially what happens is that theres a huge amount of work people are very very busywhat makes service deliverable management “manageable” is when it’s considered through a structured defined approach instead of you just calling up and saying “hey i have a problem” we structure that request we structure that workflow all those events are aggregated as alerts using servicenow i can put them in a database and i can report on it i can add analytics i can break these alerts down in every category so i know what were working on and how well were doing on it that just changes everythingour customers are always like god i had no idea hr people were spending a third of their time on benefits problems that’s because there is no visibility the whole service process is completely opaque you cant manage whats opaque so you need to create a structure that allows the whole process to become transparent so people can see what were working on how well were doingso now were getting proactive thats the management dimension as opposed to me just chasing my tail and solving problems now im going after the underlying sources of all these tickets coming in coming over the transom im going to eliminate whats driving all that work into my organization that’s what management is about as opposed to just chipping away at the volume of work thats coming inemail has become sort of the universal goto for handling this because we don’t have structured processes and workflows to do this sort of thing thats really the big change where were going away from unstructured messagebased communications to structured workflow approaches that make everybody look at the same data in a very structured transparent fashion theres no longer any need to send emails because the information will be right in front of your nosethe it department is still central in this mission rightit is a very serviceintensive business it has a fine appreciation for the service model because it often is just deluged by work and that didn’t make it very popular within the employee population service management became a survival strategy it had to find ways to deliver services in a different way than the way hr facilities or purchasing teams—or anybody else in the businessit people are technologysavvy of course so they understood and appreciated much better than an hr organization or sales organization what technology can really do to change things they understand process they understand structured approaches to things they understand databases they understand record definitions that’s why this discipline really fell into fertile ground in the world of itfor us it is also the organization that brings the notion of service management to the broader enterprise they are not just the end user of this approach these techniques and these systems theyre also the people advocating and championing how service management works across the broader enterprise the it team is not just our customer it is our partner in terms of approaching the broader enterprise which is a very unique thing about twothirds of our business still is very much focused on it internal service management but ill tell you what—a couple years ago that wouldve been almost  so our influence is very very rapidly growing into these other functional areasit is at a crossroads because a lot infrastructure operations responsibilities are moving into the cloud—no longer their problem other than that they have to procure it and from the transactional standpoint of managing the service relationship thats still their job but a lot of the infrastructure work is not it’s issue anymore a lot of the application responsibilities are at least in part moving into the line of business so it is at a point where it is redefining and reinventing itself for a completely new role in the enterprise a lot of that has to do with how we work and how we manage servicecan you give me a customer examplewe have retail customers that use servicenow for supply chain management we have some very large retail customers who essentially have been communicating with email and spreadsheets with all their stores and distribution centers on a continuous basis you know they need drills and saws in a particular store at a particular time and a particular price they don’t have them and some other store has them or distribution center has them so everybody is constantly rebalancing and moving products to the right place at the right time that’s how retailers make money supply chain optimization is the difference between making money and not making money its really importanttypically these processes run through email and everybody maintains their own little database like a spreadsheet or whatever other tool they use to keep track of all their requests and the status and so on these tasks are analogous to what goes on in service management they need total visibility right which stores what products service management lets companies start to pinpoint the problems in the supply chain and how they can proactively go after themwhat differentiates your approach from legacy companiesthat actually goes to the heart of why we even exist as a company our founder fred luddy back in  was inspired by brandnew consumer products from yahoo and google both yahoo and google had approached us to do software where people without any training or documentation were able to define their own custom homepages right you just selected things off of lists youd check boxes and then poof the page just set itself up to your own unique needs and preferencesand fred was like man you know enterprise software could be that way completely declarative no programming no training no documentation that would be an enormous thing because you would basically increase the number of people that could use your software by orders of magnitude instead of having extremely arcane technical demanding skills needed to use your software all of a sudden everybody with moderate skills could become a user of your platformour type of applications could be built before but they were very very demanding for the people doing it and it was expensive and it was slow they were very difficult to change and thats a huge problem this whole notion of agility is very important in the world of business people want to make changes to workflows to the analytics they want to make changes to the data structures literally on a daily basis that used to be a onceayear occurrence because it was so difficult and risky and painful that the tools limited the amount of change that companies could process now its just happening in front of your eyesthat’s what servicenow brought we just massively lowered the bar allowing orders of magnitude of more people to be productive on the platform then theres this notion of abstraction and agility abstraction just means that you don’t have to know as much but agility means that i can change everything about this application right in front of your eyes in real time and thats intoxicatingwhat’s your top priority for  is not that different from  theres only one goal that we have our mission is to basically drop the ‘it’ from service management discussions instead of having people talking about it service management we just want them talking about service management the implication being that its an enterprise disciplinewe believe that if were successful service management will be as common as erp and crm and all the other alphabet soup applications that youre familiar with its just something that we have its part of our infrastructure we cant even imagine a world without it thats our
