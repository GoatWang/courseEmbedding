genco for  billion  houston chronicle subscribe as low as week sign in menusections httpwwwchroncombusinessenergyarticlenrgtobuytexasgencoforbillionphp nrg to buy texas genco for  billion tom fowler copyright  houston chronicle published  am monday october   the power plants that light up many of houstons homes and businesses will have a new owner thanks to a  billion deal announced sunday nrg energy based in princeton nj will buy texas genco the operator of eight plants in and around houston and the owner of a  percent stake in the south texas project nuclear power plant the deal will nearly double the size of nrgs us electricity generating capacity giving it nearly  megawatts of power plants from coast to coast its too early to say how the plan will affect texas gencos  workers although nrg president and ceo david crane said the companys employees and management were considered key strengths in the deal nrg currently has  megawatts of power generation plants in states including california louisiana and connecticut houstonbased texas genco has about  megawatts of power generation all in texas it is the secondlargest power generator in texas behind txu corp the fastgrowing texas power market is considered one of the countrys most lucrative the price of natural gas sets the price for power in texas since so many plants here use it to fire their turbines with natural gas prices hitting new highs plants that run on less expensive fuels — as is the case with about half of texas gencos capacity — can earn huge profits theres nothing about being in texas we dont like crane said texas genco has buyers for about  percent of the power it will generate over the next three to four years making it an even more valuable and stable asset crane said good news for investors the power plants were at one time part of the company that was once known as houston lighting and power that company split up as texas deregulated its power markets and eventually became three different companies centerpoint energy which owns the local power lines and poles as well as the local natural gas service reliant energy which sells electricity to individuals and businesses and owns power plants outside texas and texas genco in early  reliant had an option to buy texas genco but didnt exercise it in april  four private investment firms — the blackstone group hellman  friedman llc kohlberg kravis roberts  co lp and texas pacific group — announced plans to acquire texas genco for  billion taking it private by buying up all its publicly traded stock earlier this year the company announced plans to issue up to  million in stock to the public but that plan has been canceled the nrg deal will give the four firms a huge return on their investments in just more than a year the investors initially used about  million of their own cash to buy the company but will get  billion in cash and  billion in stock in the sale to nrg nrg also will take on more than  billion of texas genco debt the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of  more mergers expected the power business is likely to see more mergers as the many firms with about  to  megawatts of generation capacity seek buyers or similarly sized partners bruce williamson ceo of houstons dynegy has said power companies need to combine so they have at least  megawatts of total capacity in order to compete effectively and grow in the us dynegy has  megawatts of generating capacity and has been the subject of market speculation for many months nrg built or acquired more than  power plants in the us europe asia and south america in  it filed for bankruptcy protection getting rid of about  billion in debt it emerged from chapter  bankruptcy in december  tomfowlerchroncom latest oil  energy news
