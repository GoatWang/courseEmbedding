company to the chairman and ceo bill gates chief executive officer –edit steve ballmer at mobile world congress  on january   ballmer was officially named chief executive officer as ceo ballmer handled company finances and daily operations but gates remained chairman of the board and still retained control of the technological vision as chief software architect gates relinquished daytoday activities when he stepped down as chief software architect in  while staying on as chairman and that gave ballmer the autonomy needed to make major management changes at microsoft when ballmer took over as ceo the company was fighting an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the us government and  states plus classaction lawsuits and complaints from rival companies while it was said that gates would have continued fighting the suit ballmer made it his priority to settle these saying being the object of a lawsuit effectively or a complaint from your government is a very awkward uncomfortable position to be in it just has all downside people assume if the government brought a complaint that theres really a problem and your ability to say were a good proper moral place is tough its actually tough even though you feel that way about yourselves upon becoming ceo ballmer required detailed business justification in order to approve of new products rather than allowing hundreds of products that sounded potentially interesting or trendy in  he recruited b kevin turner from walmart who was the president and ceo of sams club to become microsofts chief operating officer turner was hired at microsoft to lead the companys sales marketing and services group and to instill more process and discipline in the company’s operations and salesforce since bill gates retirement ballmer oversaw a dramatic shift away from the companys pcfirst heritage replacing most major division heads in order to break down the talenthoarding fiefdoms and businessweek said that the company arguably now has the best product lineup in its history ballmer was instrumental in driving microsofts connected computing strategy with acquisitions such as skype under ballmers tenure as ceo microsofts annual revenue surged from  billion to  billion while its net income increased  percent to  billion and its gross profit of  cents on every dollar in sales is double that of google or ibm in terms of leading the companys total annual profit growth ballmers tenure at microsoft  surpassed the performances of other wellknown ceos such as general electrics jack welch  and ibms louis v gerstner jr  these gains came from the existing windows and office franchises with ballmer maintaining their profitability fending off threats from cheaper competitors such as gnulinux and other opensource operating systems and google docs ballmer also built halfadozen new businesses such as the data centers division and the xbox entertainment and devices division  billion which has prevented the sony playstation and other gaming consoles from undermining windows and oversaw the acquisition of skype ballmer also constructed the companys  billion enterprise business consisting of new products and services such as exchange windows server sql server sharepoint system center and dynamics crm each of which initially faced an uphill battle for acceptance but have emerged as leading or dominant in each category this diversified product mix helped to offset the companys reliance on pcs and mobile computing devices as the company entered the postpc era in reporting quarterly results during april  while windows phone  and windows  had not managed to increase their market share above single digits the company increased its profit  over the previous quarter in  as the microsoft business division including office  and server and tools division cloud services are each larger than the windows division ballmer attracted criticism for failing to capitalize on several new consumer technologies forcing microsoft to play catchup in the areas of tablet computing smartphones and music players with mixed results under ballmers watch in many cases microsoft latched onto technologies like smartphones touchscreens smart cars and wristwatches that read sports scores aloud long before apple or google did but it repeatedly killed promising projects if they threatened its cash cows windows and office microsofts share price stagnated during ballmers tenure as a result in may  hedge fund manager david einhorn called on ballmer to step down as ceo of microsoft his continued presence is the biggest overhang on microsofts stock einhorn said in reference to ballmer in a may  column in forbes magazine adam hartung described ballmer as the worst ceo of a large publicly traded american company saying

muglia and steven sinofsky b kevin turner microsofts chief operating officer coo was considered by some to be a de facto number two to ballmer with turner having a strong grasp of business and operations but lacking technological vision on february   satya nadella succeeded ballmer as ceo ballmer served as director of accenture ltd and a general partner of accenture sca from  to  personalityedit ballmer is known for his energetic and exuberant personality which is meant to motivate employees and partners his flamboyant stage appearances at microsoft events are widely

meeting in a huff after a shouting match in which ballmer jumped to the defense of several colleagues according to an individual present at the time after the exchange ballmer seemed remorseful the person said once gates leaves im not going to need him for anything thats the principle ballmer said use him yes need him no in october  a vanity fair profile stated that ballmer and gates no longer

named chief executive officer as ceo ballmer handled company finances and daily operations but gates remained chairman of the board and still retained control of the technological vision as chief software architect gates relinquished daytoday activities when he stepped down as chief software architect in  while staying on as chairman and that gave ballmer the autonomy needed to make major management changes at microsoft when ballmer took over as ceo the company was fighting an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the us government and  states plus classaction lawsuits and complaints from rival companies while it was said that gates would have continued fighting the suit ballmer made it his priority to settle these saying being the object of a lawsuit effectively or a complaint from your government is a very awkward uncomfortable position to be in it just has all downside people assume if the government brought a complaint that theres really a problem and your ability to say were a good proper moral place is tough its actually tough even though you feel that way about yourselves upon becoming ceo ballmer required detailed business justification in order to approve of new

sales is double that of google or ibm in terms of leading the companys total annual profit growth ballmers tenure at microsoft  surpassed the performances of other wellknown ceos such as general electrics jack welch  and ibms louis v gerstner jr  these gains came from the existing windows and office franchises with ballmer maintaining their profitability fending off threats from cheaper competitors such as gnulinux and other opensource operating systems and google docs ballmer also built halfadozen new businesses such as the data centers division and the xbox entertainment and devices division  billion which has prevented the sony playstation and other gaming consoles from undermining windows and oversaw the acquisition of skype ballmer also constructed the companys  billion enterprise business consisting of new products and services such as exchange windows server sql server sharepoint system center and dynamics crm each of which initially faced an uphill battle for acceptance but have emerged as leading or dominant in each category this diversified product mix helped to offset the companys reliance on pcs and mobile computing devices as the company entered the postpc era in reporting quarterly results during april  while windows phone  and windows  had not managed to increase their market share above single digits the company increased its profit  over the previous quarter in  as the microsoft business division including office  and server and tools division cloud services are each larger than the windows division ballmer attracted criticism for failing to capitalize on several new consumer technologies forcing microsoft to play catchup in the areas of tablet computing smartphones and music players with mixed results under ballmers watch in

phone  and windows  had not managed to increase their market share above single digits the company increased its profit  over the previous quarter in  as the microsoft business division including

named chief executive officer as ceo ballmer handled company finances and daily operations but gates remained chairman of the board and still retained control of the technological vision as chief software architect gates relinquished daytoday activities when he stepped down as chief software architect in  while staying on as chairman and that gave ballmer the autonomy needed to make major management changes at microsoft when ballmer took over as ceo the company was fighting an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the us government and  states plus classaction lawsuits and complaints from rival companies while it was said that gates would have continued fighting the suit ballmer made it his priority to settle these saying being the object of a lawsuit effectively or a complaint from your government is a very awkward uncomfortable position to be in it just has all downside people assume if the government brought a complaint that theres really a problem and your ability to say were a good proper moral place is tough its actually tough even though you feel that way about yourselves upon becoming ceo ballmer required detailed business justification in order to approve of new

devices division  billion which has prevented the sony playstation and other gaming consoles from undermining windows and oversaw the acquisition of skype ballmer also constructed the companys  billion enterprise business consisting of new products and services such as exchange windows server sql server sharepoint system center and dynamics crm each of which initially faced an uphill battle for acceptance but have emerged as leading or dominant in each category this diversified product mix helped to offset the companys reliance on pcs and mobile computing devices as the company entered the postpc era in reporting quarterly results during april  while windows phone  and windows  had not managed to increase their market share above single digits the company increased its profit  over the previous quarter in  as the microsoft business division including office  and server and tools division cloud services are each larger than the windows division ballmer attracted criticism for failing to capitalize on several new consumer technologies forcing microsoft to play catchup in the areas of tablet computing smartphones and music players with mixed results under ballmers watch in

handled company finances and daily operations but gates remained chairman of the board and still retained control of the technological vision as chief software architect gates relinquished daytoday activities when he stepped down as chief software architect in  while staying on as chairman and that gave ballmer the autonomy needed to make major management changes at microsoft when ballmer took over as ceo the company was fighting an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the us government and  states plus classaction lawsuits and complaints from rival companies while it was said that gates would have continued fighting the suit ballmer made it his priority to settle these saying being the object of a lawsuit effectively or a complaint from your government is a very awkward uncomfortable

exchange windows server sql server sharepoint system center and dynamics crm each of which initially faced an uphill battle for acceptance but have emerged as leading or dominant in each category this diversified product mix helped to offset the companys reliance on pcs and mobile computing devices as the company entered the postpc era in reporting quarterly results during april  while windows phone  and windows  had not managed to increase their market share above single digits the company increased its profit  over the previous quarter in  as the microsoft business division including office  and server and tools division cloud services are each larger than the windows division ballmer attracted criticism for failing to capitalize on several new consumer technologies forcing
