zinfandel view all wine unapologetically powerful heady and fruitforward view more unapologetically powerful heady and fruitforward zinfandel is often thought of as a truly californian grape though in fact it is anything but this variety has followed an intriguing trajectory to reach its adoptive home beginning surprisingly in croatia originally known as tribidrag it first made its way to southern italy where it became known as primitivo from there it eventually migrated to what is now unarguably its most successful outpost in california and has thrived throughout the state of course this is also the grape of white zinfandel a sweet pink wine that enjoyed great popularity in the 9s and 9s though white zin still has a significant following today the variety is increasingly associated with the red version in the glass zinfandel commonly features a bold plush texture and notes of dark plum blackberry sweet spice black pepper dark chocolate leather and licorice and can often be described as “jammy” and a little bit sweet very ripe examples may express a hint of dried fruit like raisin fig or prune despite its significant alcohol and weight zinfandel has very smooth gentle tannins perfect pairings zinfandel is a powerfully flavored wine mingling happily with bold food like brisket lamb shanks pork ribs or anything barbecued if care is taken with regards to alcohol levels zinfandel’s hint of sweetness can work well with milder indianspiced dishes like lamb curry sommelier secret thanks to its popularity both for home winemaking and as communion wine many zinfandel vines were able to survive prohibition leading to the abundance of old vine zinfandels these lowyielding vines tend to produce wine that is concentrated complex and elegant stephen vincent crimson red

corporations and price and quality are equally varied—plenty of inexpensive bulk wine is made in the central coast area while napa is responsible for some of the world’s most prestigious and expensive
