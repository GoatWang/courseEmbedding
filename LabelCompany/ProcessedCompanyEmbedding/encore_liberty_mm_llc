using the template for making easy to install especially when using the template for making drilling holes template is additional purchase on new cabinet doors these will not directly replace nonsoftclose hingesgaps may differ and not be correctable without additional cabinet retrofitting date published  rated  out of  by ronck from very quiet id previously installed a cabinet on the wall above our master bathroom toilet a guest bedroom is on the other side of the wall and shutting a cabinet door at night was alarming rather than expensive supplemental wall soundproofing i replaced one of each doors two hinges with a softclose  an extremely inexpensive and easy installation i simultaneously installed a softclose toilet seat and lid a beautifully quiet combination dont do one without the other date published  rated  out of  by pete from easy to install easy to install replacement for my old overlay hinges that were not soft close units need to ensure your hinges are  units the measuring fit up display at the store is difficult to read and does not clearly delineate what fits bring an old hinge with you to compare to this hinge date published  rated  out of  by keetur from good replacement for builders grade grass hinges when the original hinge broke i tried to find the original manufacturer and was hard pressed identifying the correct fitting part numbers had changed and eventually other things became more important one year later i was looking at the open space and said today is the day went to hd and saw that they had hinges and then remembered i had to do a measurement head slap back home i went got online figured out the overhang and head back to the depot found the soft closing model in a two pack pulled it out and wouldnt you know taped to the security tag it says grass installed them no adjustment necessary kitchen no longer looks redneck date published  rated  out of  by momthebuilder from no more slamming cabinets i love having these soft close hinges on the cabinet doors we are doing a kitchen remodel and these are a great modern update and upgrade from the old brass hinges they close very softly and seem very sturdy and wellmade to last for years to come they are straightforward to install once you figure out the placement a couple of things could make this product better first a paper template for marking the screw holes would be helpful you may purchase a metal template from the store but it would be more convenient and easy to include a paper template along with the package i ended up making my own out of cardboard from the installation instructions on the manufacturer website secondly the screws included to fasten the hinges to the door frame could be better i drilled pilot holes as directed but when i tried to use the included screws i couldnt get them to go all the way into the cabinet frame i ended up using some selfdrilling constructions screws i had on hand instead of messing with the included ones theyre too easy to strip even with predrilling also note that youll need to have a  mm forstner drill bit another  if you are converting to these european hinges other than those issues im very happy with the hardware and will enjoy the quiet closing cabinet doors date published  rated  out of  by rmbags from easy to install but not as adjustable as i would like they installed easily and work but the  settings they have to adjust how fast the doors close are not working for me two of the settings do not slow the door closing and the other one takes too long for the door to close date published  rated  out of  by rick from replacement hinges relatively easy to install however the screw holes did not match the hinges being replaced date published  rated  out of  by maryl from great product
