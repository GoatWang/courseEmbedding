notes to the financial statements for the nine months ended july   unaudited    note   nature and continuance of operations   the company is a development stage company which was incorporated on october   operations started on that date   these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis the company has accumulated a deficit of  since its inception and has yet to achieve profitable operations and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the company to generate profitable operations in the future andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due management plans to continue to provide for its working capital needs by seeking loans from its shareholders these financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amount and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   the companys yearend is october    note   summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america   use of estimates   because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment actual results may vary from these estimates   interim financial statements   the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and should be read in conjunction with the company’s audited financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended october   certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations however the company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading the financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments that are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation of the company’s financial position and results of operations the operating results for the nine months ended july   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period of a future year     impairment of long lived assets   impairment of long lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets under asc topic  longlived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable an impairment charge is recognized or the amount if any which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value   foreign currency   translation the company is located and operating outside of the united states of america it maintains its accounting records in us dollars as follows   at the transaction date each asset liability revenue and expense is translated into us dollars by the use of exchange rates in effect at that date at the period end monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured by using the exchange rate in effect at that date the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are included in operations   the companys currency exposure is insignificant and immaterial and we do not use derivative instruments to reduce its potential exposure to foreign currency risk   financial instruments   the carrying value of the companys financial instruments consisting of cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments unless otherwise noted it is managements opinion that the company is not exposed to significant interest currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments   income taxes   the company uses the assets and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with fasb topic  accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled   basic and diluted net loss per share   in accordance with fasb topic  earnings per share the basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted net loss per common share is computed similar to basic net loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive as july   diluted net loss per share is equivalent to basic net loss per share   stock based compensation   the company accounts for stock options and similar equity instruments issued in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation accordingly compensation costs attributable to stock options or similar equity instruments granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date and expensed over the expected vesting period transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable asc topic  requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid   the company did not grant any stock options during the period ended july     comprehensive income   the company adopted fasb topic  comprehensive income which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income its components and accumulated balances the company is disclosing this information on its statement of stockholders equity comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners   the company has no elements of other comprehensive income during the period ended july     new accounting standards   in june  the fasb issued asu no  development stage entities topic  elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including an amendment to variable interest entities guidance in topic  consolidation the amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the master glossary of the accounting standards codification thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from us gaap for public business entities those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity’s financial statements have not yet been issued public business entities or made available for issuance other entities upon adoption entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by topic    management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards if currently adopted could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements   note  capital stock   on october   the company issued  common shares at  per share to the sole director of the company for the total proceeds of    on may   the company issued  common shares at  per share for the total proceeds of      note   cash and cash equivalents   the company has cash held in trust by third party in the amount of  which are from the

income tax   the company has  of net operating loss carryforward available to offset future taxable income these net operating losses are not likely to be fully realized and consequently a full valuation allowance has been established relating to such deferred tax assets this cumulative tax loss expires as early as october       item  managements discussion and analysis of financial

that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report   in this quarterly report unless otherwise specified all dollar amounts are expressed in united states dollars all references to us refer to united states dollars and all references to common shares refer to the common shares in our capital stock   as used in this quarterly report the terms we

is collected and the final layout has been confirmed the company has launched the corporate website in december of       results of operations   kama has not generated any revenues for the nine months ended july     the company experienced general and administration expenses of  for the nine months ended july   compared to general and administration expenses of  for the nine months ended july   the decrease in expenses experienced by the company has been related to decrease in professional expenses spent by the company   for the nine months ended july   the company experienced a net loss of  as compared to  for the nine months ended july     liquidity and capital resources   during the ninemonths period ended july   the company did not have any working capital needs as of july   the company has cash and cash equivalence in the amount of  management does not expect that the current level of cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operation for the next twelvemonth period in the event that additional funds are required to maintain operations our officers and directors have agreed to advance us sufficient capital to allow us to continue operations we may also be able to obtain more future loans from our shareholders but there are no agreements or understandings in place currently   we believe that we will require additional funding to expand our business and ensure its future profitability we anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock however we do not have any agreements in place for any future equity financing in the event we are not successful in selling our common stock we may also seek to obtain shortterm loans from our director   offbalance sheet arrangements   none   item  quantitative disclosures about market risks   as a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide the information required by this item   item  controls and procedures   we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the securities exchange act of  as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our president our principal executive officer principal accounting officer and principal financial officer to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures our management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures   as of july   the end of the threemonth period ended covered by this report our president our principal executive officer principal accounting officer and principal financial officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on the foregoing our president our principal executive officer principal accounting officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report   there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended july   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting       part ii other information   items  legal proceedings   we know of no material existing or pending legal proceedings against our company nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation there are no proceedings in which any of our directors officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial shareholder is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest   item a risk factors   much of the information included in this quarterly report includes or is based upon estimates projections or other forward looking statements such forward looking statements include any projections or estimates made by us and our management in connection with our business operations while these forwardlooking statements and any assumptions upon which they are based are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business actual results will almost always vary sometimes materially from any estimates predictions projections assumptions or other future performance suggested herein   such estimates projections or other forward looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties as outlined below we caution the reader that important factors in some cases have affected and in the future could materially affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in any such estimates projections or other forward looking statements   our common shares are considered speculative during the development of our new business operations prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set out below   risks related to our business   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means we may not be able to achieve our objectives and may have to suspend or cease operations   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion as at october   this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business without additional financing andor generating profits if we are unable to do so we will have to cease operations and you will lose your investment   because all of our assets and our officers and directors are located outside the united states of america it may be difficult for an investor to enforce within the united states any judgments obtained against us or any of our officers and directors   all of our assets are located outside of the united states and we do not currently maintain a permanent place of business within the united states in addition our directors and officers are nationals andor residents of countries other than the united states and all or a substantial portion of such persons assets are located outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for an investor to effect service of process or enforce within the united states any judgments obtained against us or our officers or directors including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of china and other jurisdictions would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our director and officer predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in china or other jurisdictions against us or our director and officer predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof   because we have only one officer and director who are responsible for our managerial and organizational structure in the future there may not be effective disclosure and accounting controls to comply with applicable laws and regulations which could result in fines penalties and assessments against us   we have only one officer and director he is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the sarbanes oxley act of  when theses controls are implemented they will be responsible for the administration of the controls should they not have sufficient experience they may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the sec which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment   because we do not maintain any insurance if a judgment is rendered against us we may have to cease operations   we do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future because we do not have any insurance if we are made a party to a lawsuit we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation in the event that we do not defend the litigation or a judgment is rendered against us we may have to cease operations   because all of our assets and our sole officer and directors are located outside the united states of america it may be difficult for an investor to enforce within the united states any judgments obtained against us or any of our officers and directors   all of our assets are located outside of the united states in addition our director and officer is a national andor resident of countries other than the united states and all or a substantial portion of such persons assets are located outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for an investor to effect service of process or enforce within the united states any judgments obtained against us or our officers or directors including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of china or china or other jurisdictions would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our director and officer predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in china or other jurisdictions against us our sole officer and our directors predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof   if we are not able to effectively respond to competition our business may fail   there are many small software developers that sell software products which are similar to our proposed business venture most of these competitors have established businesses with a established customer base we will attempt to compete against these groups by offering a much higher quality product compared to our competitors’ products with a more customizable product however we cannot assure you that such a strategy will be successful or that competitors will not copy our business strategy our inability to achieve sales and revenues due to competition will have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition   we need to raise additional investment capital in the future in order to commence our business operations   if we are unable to raise the required investment capital you may lose all of your investment in the current economic environment it is extremely difficult for companies without profits or revenues such as us to raise capital we currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding however we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock in the event we are not successful in selling our common stock we may also seek to obtain shortterm loans from our director although no such arrangement has been made at this time we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our director to meet our initial capital requirement needs if we are unable to raise the required financing we will be unable to proceed with our business plan and you may lose your entire investment   because our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock an investor faces the risk of having their percentage ownership diluted in the future   we anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock in the future if we do sell more common stock your investment could be subject to dilution dilution is the difference between what you pay for your stock and the net tangible book value per share immediately after the additional shares are sold by us these shares may also be issued without security holder approval and if issued may be granted voting powers rights and preferences that differ from and may be superior to those of the registered shares   risks related to our common stock   trading in our common shares on the otc bulletin board is limited and sporadic making it difficult for our shareholders to sell their shares or liquidate their investments   our common shares are currently listed for public trading on the otc bulletin board the trading price of our common shares has been subject to wide fluctuations trading prices of our common shares may fluctuate in response to a number of factors many of which will be beyond our control the stock market has generally experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with no current business operation there can be no assurance that trading prices and price earnings ratios previously experienced by our common shares will be matched or maintained these broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common shares regardless of our operating performance   in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities classaction litigation has often been instituted such litigation if instituted could result in substantial costs for us and a diversion of managements attention and resources   our stock is a penny stock trading of our stock may be restricted by the secs penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock   our stock is a penny stock the securities and exchange commission has adopted rule g which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price as defined less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to trade our securities we believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock   the financial industry regulatory authority or finra has adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock   in addition to the penny stock rules described above finra has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer a brokerdealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares   item  unregistered sales of equity
