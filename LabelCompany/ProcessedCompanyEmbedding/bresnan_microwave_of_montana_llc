our  step process why incorporate general faqs our guaranteethe benefits of incorporatingincorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships if you are looking for tax flexibility limited liability and the option to raise capital incorporation may be the best path for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business typically ceases to exist in its current form being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors incorporate today  or call  want to

of montana bresnan communications llc plaintiff and appellee v state of montana department of revenue defendant and appellant no da –     decided december   for appellant david r stewart courtney jenkins argued teresa g whitney special assistant attorney generals montana department of revenue legal services office helena montana for appellee robert l sterup argued kyle anne gray shane p coleman holland  hart llp billings montana ¶  the state of montana department of revenue department appeals the order of the thirteenth judicial district yellowstone county that determined that the department lacked authority to impose retroactive assessments on bresnan communications llc bresnan the department also appeals the separate findings of fact conclusions of law and order that determined that bresnan owns exclusively class eight cable television system properties under § ––lk mca we reverse and remand¶  we address the following issues on appeal whether the district court properly determined that bresnan owned exclusively class eight property whether the district court properly concluded that the department lacked authority to impose retroactive property tax assessmentsprocedural and factual background¶  bresnan challenged the departments decision to tax bresnan as a single entity rather than allowing bresnan to apportion unilaterally its assets among tax classifications bresnan is a delaware limited liability company that operates in montana bresnan purchased the cable television network infrastructure in montana that is at the center of this dispute in ¶  bresnans  network was typical of cable systems the “headend” of that network received and broadcasted data that bresnan chose the headend broadcasted data over the “trunk cable” the industry name for the networked cable system that connected bresnans data feed to each customers neighborhood once the data reached a customers neighborhood the “feeder cable” transmitted data throughout the neighborhood each individual customer had a “drop cable” that connected the feeder cable to the customers home the drop cable connected to the customers “terminal equipment” the terminal equipment commonly known as the settop box interpreted which data to play on a television¶  bresnan began to upgrade the networks infrastructure to include new services shortly after the purchase bresnan sought to integrate services beyond basic television programming bresnan wanted to bundle expanded cable programming cable ondemand video services highspeed internet data services internet and voiceover internet protocol telephony services voip bresnan labels these services its “triple play” package the upgrades necessary to include these services altered bresnans network from its  form¶  bresnans expert accounting and valuation report describes bresnans “significant investment in system engineering costly new equipment upgraded distribution plant and installation labor” in order to expand its cable programming bresnan improved its satellite receiver dishes installed signal combiners optical laser transmission equipment and added optical fiber between the headend and feeder cable distribution nodes bresnan invested in videoondemand servers and upgraded distribution node equipment bresnan also distributed new settop boxes to customers¶  bresnan made additional investments to prepare its system for internet services following its cable upgrade bresnan made business arrangements to provide connection to the internet and upgraded its physical system to affect the addition of internet services physical upgrades included data switches in each headend to interface with the internet connections in seattle and denver local data servers in main headends and a “cable modem termination system” cmts¶  the cmts allowed bresnan to combine the internet data with the cable data into a single electrical signal for transfer over bresnans system bresnan also provided cable modems to subscribers who purchased internet service to achieve the transfer of internet service to its customers bresnan used both the cmts and the recentlyinstalled signal combiners optical fiber between headends and distribution nodes and existing drop cables¶  bresnan upgraded its network further to provide voip residential telephone services bresnan contracted with netphone a joint venture partner to effect this upgrade netphone provided most of the necessary capital and software to bring about residential voip capabilities bresnan provided use of the cmts to combine the residential voip data with the cable and internet data into a single electrical signal for transfer over bresnans network bresnan used both the cmts and the recentlyinstalled signal combiners optical fiber between headends and distribution nodes and existing drop cables to achieve the transfer of residential voip service to its customers¶  bresnan also engaged in the “system hardening” process for its network after upgrades to enable residential voice services system hardening included further physical changes to bresnans network specifically bresnan installed battery backups and other unspecified equipment to identify and reduce interference for residential voip service system hardening reduced interference that specifically would have affected the data and voip traffic on its network¶  bresnan made further upgrades to enable commercial voip these upgrades included new switches in select headends and data servers for commercial subscriber voicemail services bresnan used the cmts to combine the commercial voip data with residential voip cable and internet data into a single electrical signal for transfer over bresnans network bresnan used both the cmts and the recentlyinstalled signal combiners optical fiber between headends and distribution nodes and existing drop cables to achieve the transfer of commercial voip service to its customers¶  bresnan lastly began to provide the same terminal equipment to customers in  without consideration of which services the customer had purchased from bresnan this new terminal equipment provided an integrated experience to customers regardless of which services the customer had purchased from bresnan all data arrived into a single piece of terminal equipment the single terminal equipment processed that data and delivered the appropriate service to the customer¶  although bresnan functionally had bundled its triple play services for consumers bresnan segregated each service for taxation purposes montana imposes an excise tax upon voice services such as bresnans telephony operations section –– et seq mca montana imposes no excise taxes upon cable television or high speed internet section –– et seq mca bresnan paid separate franchise fees to local governments for the right to install its cable television system in public rights of way bresnan needed to pay no franchise fees however for high speed internet or telephony¶  the montana legislature amended the montana tax code in  to include language central to this dispute the amendment specifically incorporated “telecommunications services” into the tax code when it created an assessment classification for “telecommunications services companies” section ––d mca  the department would for the first time assess centrally allocations of “telecommunications services companies” under the new amendment section ––d mca  comments at the hearings on the bill show that the bills sponsor intended to provide a tax decrease from the pre– assessment and taxation rates for “the assets of telecommunications” in future telecommunications developments mont sen tax comm hearing on hb   legis reg sess – apr  ¶  montanas administrative rules require the department to value centrally reported property through the unit method of valuation admin rm   unit valuation considers the market value of the company as a functional whole instead of the value of individual components whether a taxpayer uses local filing as compared to central filing dictates the method that the department uses to value property¶  bresnan unilaterally apportioned company assets when bresnan made its tax reports in order to segregate its property bresnan used centralized statewide reporting for its voice operations bresnan included roughly  of company assets in its voice operation tax declaration bresnan reported voice operations as “bresnan digital services llc” doing business as “montana telephony” from  to  bresnan also centrally reported its microwave satellite operations as a portion of the same  of company assets the department had classified bresnans voice operations as class thirteen property from  to  because the voice operations were “allocations of a centrally assessed telecommunications and services company” the class thirteen classification resulted in a  centralized assessment on bresnans voice property¶  bresnan included the remaining  of its assets in locally reported cable and internet properties assessments as “bresnan communications llc” local communities assessed bresnans cable and internet properties from  to  local assessments resulted in a  local assessment on cable and internet properties the department knew of bresnans decision to report its cable and internet properties for local assessment as class eight properties from  to ¶  the department audited bresnan in december  for tax years  and  the department determined upon completion of the audit in august  that bresnan should report its property as a single entity rather than as three separate entities the department informed bresnan that montana law required the department to assess bresnan centrally as one unit and to classify bresnans property under class thirteen as allocations of a centrally assessed telecommunications services company¶  the department issued revised assessments for bresnan for tax years   and  following the audit the departments revised assessments centrally assessed all of bresnans property under class thirteen the department submitted the revised assessments to bresnan bresnan paid parts of the assessments under protest¶  the department similarly assessed bresnan centrally on may   as one unit for the  tax year the  assessment subjected all of bresnans montana properties to class thirteen central assessment at a  tax rate section –– mca the reclassification increased bresnans tax burden from  in tax year  to  in tax year  bresnan filed this declaratory judgment action in response on july  ¶  bresnan sought to prevent the department from issuing revised assessments of bresnan for tax years   and  bresnan also sought to prevent the department from issuing any other revised assessments bresnan additionally sought a declaration that the department illegally had assessed all of bresnans property as class thirteen property bresnan further asked the district court to require the department to refund taxes that bresnan had paid under protest bresnan lastly challenged the legality of the departments method of assessment for the  tax year¶  the district court granted bresnans motion for summary judgment on the departments ability to issue retroactive assessments in a written order on september   the district court conducted a bench trial on october   the district court concluded that bresnan owned class eight properties the district court directed the department to refund with interest the payments that bresnan had made under protest the district court also vacated the departments retroactive assessments of bresnan the department appealsstandard of review¶  we review for clear error a district courts findings of fact roland v davis  mt  ¶   mont   p d  clear error exists if substantial credible evidence fails to support the findings of fact if the district court misapprehended the evidences effect or if we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake roland ¶  we review for correctness a district courts conclusions of law roland ¶  we review de novo a district courts ruling on a motion for summary judgment bailey v state farm mut auto ins co  mt  ¶   mont   pd discussion¶  whether the district court properly determined that bresnan owned exclusively class eight property¶  we first address whether montana law allows the department to classify bresnans property in class eight or class thirteen montana law defines class eight properties to include “cable television systems” section ––k mca montana taxes class eight properties at  section –– mca class thirteen properties comprise “allocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies” section ––d mca montana taxes class thirteen property at “ of its market value” section –– mca¶  these statutory definitions pose the question of whether bresnans property should be classified as a “cable television system” or a “telecommunications services company” the district court concluded as a matter of law that bresnans property qualified as a “cable television system” the district court evaluated bresnans “oneway transmission of video programming” “set of closed transmission paths” and “system that receives and amplifies the signals broadcast by one or more television stations” to reach its conclusion the district court relied both on the legislatures definition of a “cable television system” and the language in bresnans montana cable television franchise agreements that matched the language in the federal cable act bresnan fit the definition of a cable television system under these factors¶  the district court further concluded as a matter of law that “bresnans addition of voice and data services did not change the character of its cable television systems” the district court relied upon the departments apparent failure to “reconcile the necessity of franchise agreements for bresnan to deliver its video programming” with the departments contention that “bresnan as a whole is a telecommunications company” the district court applied a use test to measure bresnans “ppe property plant and equipment bandwidth subscribers or revenue” to “conclude that bresnan owns property subject to class eight property taxation”¶  the department challenges the district courts focus on bresnans physical attributes to the exclusion of the use and productivity of bresnans property the department alleges that the district court erroneously considered only “a portion of bresnans use and productivity” the department argues that the district court should have evaluated bresnans classification based upon bresnans use of all of its property and the productivity that results from that use chicago m  st p ry co v powell cnty  mont    p    wheir v dye  mont   pd   the department further takes issue with the district courts lack of “analysis on the physical attributes or use and productivity of bresnans internet property”¶  the district court relied heavily upon our decision in omimex canada ltd v state dept of revenue  mt   mont   pd  in omimex we considered whether a natural gas companys property fell within § ––b mca  omimex ¶  section ––b mca  encompasses “allocations for centrally assessed natural gas companies having a major distribution system in this state” omimexs lack of a major distribution system within montana excluded it from § ––b mca  omimex ¶ ¶  “cable television systems” comprise class class eight property section ––k mca “allocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies” comprise class thirteen properties section ––d mca neither classification statute contains the requirement that a taxpayer have “a major distribution system in this state” similar to the provision in § ––b mca  at issue in omimex this physical attribute requirement in omimex—in the form of a major distribution system—remains unique for purposes of property tax classification statutes not surprisingly omimex represents the sole case where we have determined that the physical attributes of a taxpayers property alone govern property tax classification omimex ¶ ¶  the district courts analysis focused upon a physical attribute of bresnans property—the transfer of electrical data signals physical attributes do not represent the standard that montana courts use to classify property the district courts focus upon the physical attributes of bresnans network confines the departments ability to classify bresnans entire property in proportion “to its use its productivity its utility and its general setting in the economic organization of society” yellowstone pipe line co v state bd of equalization  mont    pd    the physical attributes of bresnans property and the productivity that results from the use of that property represent the proper metric to classify bresnan wheir  mont at –  pd at ¶  bresnan argues that we should uphold the district courts conclusion regardless because bresnan qualifies as a “cable television system” under the definition of a rural cooperative utility cable television system “that receives and amplifies the signals broadcast by one or more television stations” section –– mca bresnan cites to its cable franchise agreements with montana cities to bolster its position bresnan also correctly identifies that both parties experts agree that bresnan operates a cable television system the department concedes “that bresnans systems are capable at least in part of these utilities”¶  this definition of a “cable television system” fails to capture all of the uses to which bresnan puts its network nothing restricts the use and productivity of bresnans network to the delivery of an electrical data signal only for cable television bresnans expert report from dr walter stanley ciciora describes cable as the “predominant” but not exclusive “use of even the most technologically advanced cable television systems today” bresnans accounting and valuation report describes a “multimillion dollar commitment to enhance  cable that required a significant investment in system engineering costly new equipment upgraded distribution plant and installation labor” that same report describes additional investments “needed to provide data services” and “needed to provide voip residential telephony services” as well as the “incremental cost of enabling commercial voip services” dr ciciora concluded that “most of bresnans cable television systems are technologically advanced providing cable television programming and high speed data and voice”¶  bresnan altered its network from one with the limited ability to broadcast only cable in  to the multiservice capable network at issue in this litigation bresnans argument that its network operates exclusively a “cable television system” denies the obvious fact of the actual use and productivity of bresnans upgraded network this upgraded network combined with bresnans attendant property has expanded bresnans operation beyond a “cable television system” as defined by any section of the montana code including § ––k mca¶  various provisions within title  and the administrative rules of montana explain what constitutes a telecommunications services provider for property tax purposes we must construe statutes that address the same subject matter and that are consistent with one another to ensure that all statutes have effect mountain w farm bureau mut ins co v hall  mt  ¶   mont   pd ¶  “allocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies” comprise class

physical elements when the use and productivity of the network as a whole fits the statutory definition of a telecommunications network an analysis of the use and productivity of bresnans entire network results in the inescapable conclusion that bresnan uses a single transmission line to deliver three separate services this analysis imparts the department with the authority to classify bresnans property accordingly under class thirteen as a telecommunication service powell cnty  mont at   p at  wheir  mont at   pd at ¶  the legislatures exemption of certain properties from class thirteen further supports this outcome the expression of one thing in a statute implies the exclusion of another omimex ¶  the legislature explicitly excluded from class thirteen any class five property owned by an organization that provides telecommunications services section ––f mca this express exclusion of class five property implies that the legislature intended to include all other property that a telecommunications services provider owns in class thirteen section ––f mca if the legislature had intended to exclude class eight “cable television systems” from class thirteen the legislature could have added the additional language of “and under –– class eight” to the class thirteen exemptions section ––f mca the legislature did not do so¶  to limit bresnans classification to a “cable television service” fails to achieve the purpose of montanas taxation classification statutes statutory definitions and administrative guidelines taken together and in the absence of an applicable exclusion make clear that bresnans use and productivity fits the definition of a “telecommunication services provider” bresnan as a result remains subject to assessment under class thirteen¶  the dissent argues that the departments failure to value bresnans property in different classes “disregards the basic premise of our property classification system” dissent ¶  nothing in the classification statutes requires however that the department apportion bresnans property among montanas various property tax classifications this court previously has defined “allocation” for taxation purposes as “the process of attributing to the taxing state the value of a portion of an interstate system for tax purposes” yellowstone pipe line co  mont at   pd at  the class thirteen definition of “allocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies” requires only that the department consider all of bresnans property located within montana for taxation purposes section ––d mca yellowstone pipe line co  mont at   pd at  this decision allows the department to address properly “an administrative matter within its broad discretion” state v hornstein  mt  ¶   mont   pd ¶  the dissent further argues that the overwhelming use of bresnans property takes the form of “oneway transmission that receives and amplifies television broadcast signals” dissent ¶  the departments audit of bresnan revealed however that very little of bresnans use of its system involves exclusively cable television that relies on oneway transmissions that receive and amplify broadcast signals in fact most of bresnans system as currently used has the capacity to support the twoway transmission of electrical data signals the operation of a “telecommunications services company” involves the twoway transmission of electrical data signals section ––d mca the departments audit of bresnan confirms that “bresnan upgraded their equipment and lines to twoway transmission capacity fiber optic in most cases to offer many of their advanced services that are available today”¶  our determination that the department appropriately classified the use and productivity of bresnans property under class thirteen instead of class eight requires us to analyze the assessment of class thirteen property the district court determined that central assessment did not apply to bresnan the district court exempted bresnan from central assessment based upon its determination that bresnan qualified as a class eight “cable television system” the district court further reasoned that the central assessment statute § –– mca “omits any reference to cable television system s” a class thirteen classification conversely denotes by its terms “centrally assessed telecommunications services companies” section ––d mca bresnans qualification as a telecommunications service company requires us to determine whether class thirteen classification of bresnan would be appropriate under the “centrally assessed” element of § ––d mca¶  montana law requires the department to assess centrally “property owned by a corporation ․ operating a single and continuous property operated in more than one county” section –– mca properties that enjoy a unity of ownership and devotion to a single use qualify as single and continuous properties w union tel co v state bd of equalization  mont  –  pd  –  “single and continuous” properties are functionally integrated over a wide area and enjoy a unity of use and management w union tel co  mont at –  pd at –¶  bresnan operates a single and continuous network in the twenty montana counties where bresnan delivers three services bresnan operates in an integrated fashion bresnans customers pay one bill for the purchase of all three services bresnan manages its operations from the network operations center in billings customers use a single piece of terminal equipment bresnan owns class thirteen property in those locations where bresnan operates a single transmission line to deliver three services to customers bresnan fits the statutory definition of a property that the department must assess centrally section ––d mca¶  whether the district court properly concluded that the department lacked authority to impose retroactive property tax assessments¶  we next address whether the department possessed authority to issue revised assessments for bresnans property for tax years   and  the district court determined that § ––b mca controlled its analysis the district court interpreted our revised assessment case law to allow reassessment only in circumstances where there had been a clerical error or a ministerial mistake the district court determined that our case law foreclosed reassessments “made to comport with a change in assessor judgment” to avoid impermissible prejudice to the taxpayer¶  the district court reasoned that the departments shift away from bresnans prior income statement and balance sheet to a centralized assessment represented a shift in assessor judgment the district court concluded that the “change in appraisal judgment” placed the departments reassessment “outside the definition of an—‘erroneous assessment’ “ allowed under § –– mca the department argues that it “lacked the information necessary to make a determination on central assessment before its audit of bresnan” the department contends that it “performed unit valuations on bresnan for tax years –” upon discovery of “the information necessary to make a determination on central assessment”¶  the department points out that none of our revised assessment cases “involved centrally assessed property” the authority to issue revised assessments is critical because appraisers must “annually test whether a property requires central assessment” the department contends that restraint on its ability to “exercise judgment to determine whether the property requires central assessment” would render the department unable to perform its duty under montana law¶  we have defined the contours of revised assessments only twice we determined first in evans products co v missoula cnty  mont    pd    that “a clerical error falls under the plain language meaning of ‘erroneous assessment’ as it is used in section –– mca” evans products  mont at   pd at  we further noted that “the bulk of authority and prior montana case law suggest that appraisal the setting of market value is an integral part of the taxation process” evans products  mont at   pd at  this court analyzed revised assessments more recently in kruse v cascade cnty  mont   pd   we clarified in kruse that “property which has not been fully taxed according to appropriate tax procedures may be properly reassessed” kruse  mont at   pd at ¶  neither evans products nor kruse specifically examined revised assessments in the context of property that must be assessed centrally evans products and kruse make clear however that § –– mca allows the department to reassess property that has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures evans products  mont at   pd at  kruse  mont at   pd at  unit valuation involves a specific type of appraisal appraisal represents an “integral part of the taxation process” evans products  mont at   pd at  the department logically possesses the authority under § –– mca to reassess property subject to central assessment when the department determines that such property has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures¶  the department must “discover” property that has escaped assessment before it has authority to issue a revised assessment section ––b mca many taxpayers in montana including bresnan selfreport their assets into different assessment classes a more thorough look at the taxpayers property through an audit constitutes the only vehicle for the department to “discover” property that has escaped assessment when the taxpayer selfreports the department completed its audit of bresnan in ¶  the departments audit revealed that bresnan should be classified properly as a class thirteen “telecommunication services provider” this reclassification resulted in bresnan being subject to central assessment the audit further revealed past improper classification of property on the part of bresnan this improper classification apparently arose through bresnans selfreporting of its assets the historic improper classification of bresnans property represents property that escaped full taxation according to appropriate tax procedures section ––b mca¶  the departments audit determined that bresnans allocations of percentages of its property as cable data or voice failed to “appropriately represent the operations of the segments” the property that bresnan had classified as “telecommunications services” property contained only that property dedicated exclusively to voice service bresnan had classified the remaining lions share of its property as “cable television services” this substantially larger portion included any property that involved cable or data in any way the audit found that “using this methodology bresnans cable operations are overstated and telephony is understated”¶  kory hofland hofland worked as the unit manager of centrally assessed and industrial properties at the department bresnan deposed hofland hofland described property that had not been taxed fully hofland identified that bresnan had limited its property that would be assessed centrally by “only reporting to class thirteen property of a receiver of bresnans services that only had telephony” hofland explained that “if that recipient subscribed to telephony and internet they werent reported in the telephony portion” hofland similarly explained that “if they subscribed to telephony and cable they werent in bresnans telephony reporting” hofland expressed further concerns about bresnans lack of backup to “audited financial data” with regard to bresnans historic reporting arrangement¶  the departments audit of bresnan and hoflands testimony indicate that the audit of bresnan enabled the department to discover property that had not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures the department reclassified bresnan as a class thirteen telecommunication services provider subject to central assessment in order to value the full property taxes due on bresnans property section –– mca grants the department the authority to issue a revised assessment of bresnan in order to capture the value of property that has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures¶  bresnan challenges the departments decision to issue a revised assessment as the result of a “change in assessor judgment” evidence in the record directly contradicts bresnans argument the departments discovery and subsequent reclassification arose from the audits revelation of inaccuracies in bresnans selfclassification we decline to characterize the discovery of property that has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures due to a misclassification on the taxpayers part as a mere “change in assessor judgment” we will not presume bresnans bad faith in selfallocation we similarly will not tie the departments hands simply because it discovered the improper classification through an audit when the taxpayer selfreports¶  we reverse the decision of the district court we remand and direct the district court to enter a judgment consistent with this opinion¶  the court eschews any attempt to analyze the extensive record evidence and instead relies heavily on the presumption that because bresnan provides some telecommunications services nearly all of its property can be assessed by the department under class thirteen i believe that the court has disregarded the plain wording and intent of montanas property classification statutes and failed to properly apply the “physical attributes” and “use and productivity” tests¶  the proper application of these tests results in companies being taxed under multiple property classes depending on the use of their property the district court extensively analyzed and entered findings about this system including the property tax classifications applied to companies such as montana dakota utilities northwestern energy avista corporation portland general corporation and yellowstone valley electric cooperative all of which are taxed in multiple classes more specifically regarding the telecommunications industry the district court found that “telecommunications companies that report for central assessment under class thirteen also report and are assessed locally for certain of their montana property under class eight including sprint nextel qwest and centurytel” the court found that the cable  communications corporation a company that provides cellular telephone and cable television services “reports its cellular telephone properties for central assessment under class thirteen while reporting its cable television properties for local assessment under class eight”¶  regarding bresnan the district court found from the extensive evidence presented that “over  of bresnans montana bandwidth is used exclusively for the oneway transmission of video programming” further “statewide  of bresnans channels were devoted exclusively to the oneway transmission of video programming while  channels were devoted to voicedata and  channels were used for videoondemand which also is oneway video transmission” to summarize its lengthy findings the court found that bresnans properties “primarily were and are used to provide the oneway transmission to subscribers of video programming ” the district courts findings are supported by substantial evidence and have not been overturned the courts approach is simply to assume that because bresnan has telecommunications capabilities the department is authorized to tax nearly all of its property under class thirteen¶  turning to the statutes we are to start with the principle that “tax statutes must be construed in favor of the taxpayer” omimex ¶  the statutes make clear that holding commercial property that facilitates the twoway transmission of voice image and data qualifies an entity as a telecommunications services company see § ––a mca “retail telecommunications” means “the twoway transmission of voice image data or other information over wire cable fiber optics microwave radio satellite or similar facilities that originates or terminates in this state” indeed the court correctly notes that by definition “a ‘telecommunications services provider’ offers retail telecommunications services” opinion ¶  citing § –– mca because bresnan holds some twoway telephony and internet property it operates in part as a telecommunications company however the court gets sidetracked by then deducing that § ––d mca allows the department to classify nearly all of bresnans property under class thirteen opinion ¶  when in reality only some of that property—a very small fraction of it—actually facilitates the twoway transmission of voice image and data¶  the statute does not require that all property of a telecommunications services company is to be taxed under class thirteen by allowing the department to tax bresnans oneway property under class thirteen the court disregards the basic premise of our property classification system—different types of property are taxed in different classes n pac ry v sanders co  mont  –  p    determining “classification must be based upon substantial distinctions which make one class really different from another” see § –– mca the legislature made a conscious decision to tax cable television systems at a  rate under class eight § ––k mca and telecommunications services property at a  rate under class thirteen § ––d mca we should not permit the department to ignore this distinction consistent with the classification system as a whole and the duty to construe the statutes in favor of the taxpayer only property that actually meets the definition of telecommunications services property should be so classified thus the statutes require an apportionment of taxes between bresnans twoway transmission property—which demarcates a telecommunications services company in the first place—and its predominately oneway cable television property¶  the courts determination that the “legislature intended to include all other property that a telecommunications services provider owns in class thirteen” opinion ¶  does great harm to not only bresnan but potentially to the property tax system as a whole this holding runs directly counter to the property classification structure and to the manner in which telecommunications companies—and other companies—are actually taxed for example class nine property includes “allocations for centrally assessed natural gas distribution utilities․” section ––d mca under the courts analysis this language would necessarily incorporate all properties of natural gas distribution utilities into this class and tax them at a  rate see § –– clearly this is not the case as other utility property such as “air and water pollution control equipment” is classified under class five and taxed at a rate of  see § ––b ¶  moreover the court fails to apply our use and productivity test with any precision during oral argument bresnan analogized its property to a superhighway consisting of  lanes  of these lanes are filled bumpertobumper with trucks travelling one way  hours per day  days per year the remaining  lanes contain cars travelling two ways these cars do not move all the time only sporadically the trucks in this analogy represent bresnans oneway cable television property the cars represent bresnans twoway telecommunications services property accordingly after making extensive findings the district court determined that the overwhelming use of bresnans property is oneway transmission that receives and amplifies television broadcast signals the courts wholesale reliance on the departments audit does not render these findings clearly erroneous—m r civ p a requires that we “give due regard to the trial courts opportunity to judge the witnesses credibility ” both parties experts testified that bresnan operates a cable television system class eight property includes “cable television systems” § ––k mca which by definition “receive  and amplif y the signals broadcast by one or more television stations” section –– mca¶  the court sidesteps the hard work of analyzing the record evidence declining “to parse the number and type of electrical data signals that bresnan transmits over its network or the allocations of the networks physical elements․” opinion ¶  however nothing could be more indicative of a networks use than the number and type of data signals actually being transmitted over it in sum the court claims to be classifying property on the basis of use opinion ¶¶    but ultimately fails to do so by allowing the department to place nearly all of bresnans property into class thirteen¶  bresnan has been changing the services it provides from cable television to telecommunications services consistent therewith bresnan has been reporting those changes listing properties that are utilized for telecommunications services under class thirteen however the department of revenue got up one morning and decided to flip the entire company into class thirteen thereby increasing bresnans taxes by an incredible  overnight from  million to  million even though the overwhelmingly predominant use of bresnans property is for class eight purposes this disincentive for companies to expand their telecommunications services was not created or intended by the legislature but is the work of the department it should be called highway robberyperhaps the first case of information superhighway robbery by the tax authorities¶  i dissentfootnotes  “analog electronic communication long has been measured in “bandwidth” in units of megahertz “mhz” the federal communications commission “fcc” historically defined a “channel” as six  mhz”  the court argues that by classifying nearly all of bresnans property under class thirteen the department is simply addressing “an administrative matter within its broad discretion” opinion ¶  however we have also held that an agencys implementation of a statute must be “consistent and not in conflict with the statute” and must “effectuate the purpose

our  step process why incorporate general faqs our guaranteethe benefits of incorporatingincorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships if you are looking for tax flexibility limited liability and the option to raise capital incorporation may be the best path for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business typically ceases to exist in its current form being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors incorporate today  or call  want to
