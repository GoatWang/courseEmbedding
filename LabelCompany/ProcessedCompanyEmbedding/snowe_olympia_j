sign up invalid email address got it got it by olympia j snowe by olympia j snowe march   olympia j snowe is a republican senator from maine two truths are all too often overshadowed in today’s political discourse public service is a most honorable pursuit and so is bipartisanship i have been immeasurably honored to serve the people of maine for nearly  years in public office and for the past  years in the united states senate it was incredibly difficult to decide that i would not seek a fourth term in the senate some people were surprised by my conclusion yet i have spoken on the floor of the senate for years about the dysfunction and political polarization in the institution simply put the senate is not living up to what the founding fathers envisioned during the federal convention of  james madison wrote in his notes of debates that “the use of the senate is to consist in its proceedings with more coolness with more system and with more wisdom than the popular branch” indeed the founding fathers intended the senate to serve as an institutional check that ensures all voices are heard and considered because while our constitutional democracy is premised on majority rule it is also grounded in a commitment to minority rights yet more than  years later the greatest deliberative body in history is not living up to its billing the senate of today routinely jettisons regular order as evidenced by the body’s failure to pass a budget for more than  days serially legislates by political brinkmanship as demonstrated by the debtceiling debacle of august that should have been addressed the previous january and habitually eschews full debate and an open amendment process in favor of competing upordown takeitorleaveit proposals we witnessed this again in december with votes on two separate proposals for a balancedbudget amendment to the constitution as ronald brownstein recently observed in national journal congress is becoming more like a parliamentary system — where everyone simply votes with their party and those in charge employ every possible tactic to block the other side but that is not what america is all about and it’s not what the founders intended in fact the senate’s requirement of a supermajority to pass significant legislation encourages its members to work in a bipartisan fashion one difficulty in making the senate work the way it was intended is that america’s electorate is increasingly divided into red and blue states with lawmakers representing just one color or the other before the  election  senators came from states that voted for a presidential nominee of the opposing party that number has dropped to just  senators in  the result is that there is no practical incentive for  percent of the senators to work across party lines the great challenge is to create a system that gives our elected officials reasons to look past their differences and find common ground if their initial party positions fail to garner sufficient support in a politically diverse nation only by finding that common ground can we achieve results for the common good that is not happening today and frankly i do not see it happening in the near future for change to occur our leaders must understand that there is not only strength in compromise courage in conciliation and honor in consensusbuilding — but also a political reward for following these tenets that reward will be real only if the people demonstrate their desire for politicians to come together after the planks in their respective party platforms do not prevail i certainly don’t have all the answers and reversing the corrosive trend of winnertakeall politics will take time but as i enter a new chapter in my life i see a critical need to engender public support for the political center for our democracy to flourish and to find solutions that unite rather than divide us i do not believe that in the near term the senate can correct itself from within it is by nature a political entity and therefore there must be a benefit to working across the aisle but whenever americans have set our minds to tackling enormous problems we have met with tremendous success and i am convinced that if the people of our nation raise their collective voices we can effect a renewal of the art of legislating — and restore the luster of a senate that still has the potential of achieving monumental solutions to our nation’s most urgent challenges i look forward to helping the country raise those voices to support the senate returning to its deserved status and stature — but from outside the institution more on sen olympia snowe from postopinions dana milbank a moderate’s lament carter eskew farewell sen snowe jonathan capehart olympia snowe

the th congress was almost universally derided as the worst ever it was the most polarized body since the end of reconstruction according to one study and i grew embarrassed by its partisan bickering inactivity and refusal to address the vital challenges facing america olympia snowe end challenges government what happens is that you know on mondays at least in the senate you know monday night wed have what youd call a bedcheck vote just to get you know the machinery of the senate up and running so they can start the committee process on tuesday morning things go by thursday you know jet fumes the smell of jet fumes olympia snowe morning monday tuesday it is time that we provide clarity for our seniors informing them of the services available that will lower the costs of their prescription drugs and strengthen the overall integrity of the medicare entitlement olympia snowe time integrity clarity unfortunately money in politics is an insidious thing  and a loophole in our campaign finance system was taken advantage of with money going to existing or new  groups with the sole purpose of influencing the election olympia snowe money politics finance hopefully  years later judge roberts possesses an openness with respect to issues of genderbased wage discrimination olympia snowe respect discrimination the united states senate wasnt designed to be a majorityrule institution it was designed to include and accommodate the rights of the minority in small states as well as large states olympia snowe small rights minority two truths are all too often overshadowed in todays political discourse public service is a most honorable pursuit and so is bipartisanship olympia snowe today service political in a politically diverse nation only by finding that common ground can we achieve results for the common good olympia snowe good results finding what motivated me to dedicate myself to public service for nearly twothirds of my life was the chance to produce results for those people who entrusted me to be their voice and their champion olympia snowe life myself service i represent what i think is a traditional republican a limited government fiscal responsibility

legitimate and essential when people have nowhere else to turn olympia snowe government people turn i have been immeasurably honored to serve the people of maine for nearly  years in public office and for the past  years in the united states senate it was incredibly difficult to decide that i would not seek a fourth term in the senate olympia snowe past people maine one difficulty in making the senate work the way it was intended is that americas electorate is increasingly divided into red and blue states with lawmakers representing just one color or the other olympia snowe work blue red ive never backed down from a fight and i relish a good debate olympia snowe good fight down what is the purpose of public service its to solve problems for the people you represent and certainly in the
