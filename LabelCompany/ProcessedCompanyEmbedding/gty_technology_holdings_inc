any business or industry we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify acquire and operate a business in the technology industry including software and services that may provide the opportunity to unlock the value of a private company and provide opportunities for an attractive risk adjusted return to our shareholders organizations in all industries continue to undergo rapid transformation resulting from the impact of recent technological shifts including cloud and mobile computing softwaredefined data centers sddc the rise of the practice of automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes known as the devops model heightened cybersecurity threats the challenges of managing and maintaining big data the growth in use of analytics and the adoption of software as a service saas we believe nearly every major organization currently faces and will continue to face massive disruption to legacy infrastructure and services that have failed to adapt to these technological shifts the resulting demand for these solutions has created a massive opportunity for a new breed of technology companies to provide innovative products and services that help accelerate this technology transformation a plethora of companies have developed these products and services but lack the experience or contacts necessary to navigate and accelerate the penetration of their solutions into large it departments compounding the problem large companies it departments lack the inhouse expertise to evaluate the immense number of new vendors competing

officer by institutional investor in the computer services  it consulting sector in  we believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive businesses within the technology industry including software and services that would benefit from access to the public markets and the skills of our management team our objective is to consummate a business combination with such a business and enhance shareholder value by improving its operational performance we believe we can achieve this objective by utilizing our founders extensive experience operating technology companies and our management teams network of contacts in the technology sector we believe many companies in the technology industry could benefit from access to the public markets but have been unable to do so due to a number of factors including the time it takes to conduct a traditional initial public offering market volatility and pricing uncertainty we will focus on established companies with a leading competitive position a strong management team a collaborative and collegial culture a robust financial profile and strong longterm potential for profitability the past performance of our founders and other members of our management team is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate you should not rely on the historical record of our managements performance as indicative of our future performance none of our officers or directors has any past experience with any blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies business strategy our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from their operational expertise our selection process will leverage our management teams broad and deep relationship network unique technology industry expertise and proven dealsourcing capabilities to provide us with a number of business combination opportunities our management has experience  operating companies setting and changing strategies and identifying mentoring and recruiting worldclass talent  developing and growing companies both organically and inorganically and expanding the product ranges and geographic footprints of a number of target businesses  sourcing structuring acquiring and selling businesses  partnering with other industryleading companies to increase our sales and improve the competitive position of our companies      table of contents  fostering relationships with sellers capital providers and target management teams and  accessing the capital markets across various business cycles including financing businesses and assisting companies with the transition to public ownership following the completion of this offering we will communicate with our managements network of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities business combination criteria consistent with our business strategy we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses we will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines  focus on technology industry including software and services   based upon our management teams experience we believe we will have access to deal flow and a competitive advantage in our ability to negotiate a business combination with potential targets in the technology industry our management teams extensive experience and vast network of technology leaders provides them with a differentiated opportunity to source a target validate a potential targets technology consummate a business combination with the target and help sell the targets products and services into large enterprises  established target with a history of andor capacity for free cash flow generation   we will target one or more businesses that have exhibited profitability historically andor have the potential for strong cash flow generation in the future we have a history of accelerating growth of companies with strong historical performance  fundamentally sound companies that have the potential to further improve their performance under our guidance   we believe our experience in the sector will provide validation for the targets product and network of industry contacts will allow us to enhance sales and generate a higher return for our investors  marketleading technology   we will seek a target that has a technology recognized as the clear leader in its subsector  experienced and motivated management team    we will seek a target with an established management team that we intend to complement not replace to the extent we believe it will enhance shareholder value we would seek to selectively supplement the existing management team of the business including senior management with proven leaders from our network  at an inflection point   we believe numerous technology companies lack the ability to penetrate large companies it departments potentially limiting their acceleration to attain the scale required to be a publiclylisted company or lack the validation of large it organizations we will target a company that may require additional management expertise as it transitions to a public company or where we believe our background can provide the validation necessary to drive improved financial performance  may benefit from capital markets access   we will seek a target that may benefit from the use of additional capital to drive growth or from a public currency to acquire competitors and grow revenue these criteria are not intended to be exhaustive any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based to the extent relevant on these general guidelines as well as other considerations factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant in the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination which as discussed in this prospectus would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the sec      table of contents initial business combination nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least  of the value of the assets held in the trust account excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination if our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of finra or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria our shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion we anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire  of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses we may however structure our initial business combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than  of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons but we will only complete such business combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended or the investment company act even if the post transaction company owns or acquires  or more of the voting securities of the target our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination for example we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in this case we would acquire a  controlling interest in the target however as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination if less than  of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post transaction company the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of nasdaqs  of net assets test if the business combination involves more than one target business the  of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions our business combination process in evaluating a prospective target business we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass among other things meetings with incumbent management and employees document reviews and inspection of facilities as applicable as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us we are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor officers or directors in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor officers or directors we or a committee of independent directors will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of finra or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view members of our management team and our independent directors will directly or indirectly own founder shares andor private placement warrants following this offering and accordingly may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination further each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination      table of contents each of our officers and directors presently has and any of them in the future may have additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity accordingly if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity subject to their fiduciary duties under cayman islands law we do not believe however that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination our sponsor officers and directors have agreed pursuant to a written letter agreement not to participate in the formation of or become an officer or director of any other blank check company until we have entered into a

having an aggregate fair market value of at least  of the value of the assets held in the trust account excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination if our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of finra or a valuation or appraisal firm our shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion     we will complete our initial business combination only if the posttransaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or is otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the investment company act even if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the voting securities of the target our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the postbusiness combination company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction if less than  of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the posttransaction company the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of nasdaqs  of net assets test provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one target business the  of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the transactions together as our initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval as applicable permitted purchases of public shares and public warrants by our affiliates         if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor initial shareholders directors executive officers advisors or their affiliates may      table of contents     purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions none of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules any such purchases will be reported pursuant to section  and section  of the exchange act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements see proposed business  permitted purchases of our securities for a description of how our sponsor initial shareholders directors executive officers advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase securities from in any private transaction     the purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met the purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible in addition if such purchases are made the public float of our class a ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange      table of contents redemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our initial business combination         we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination including interest earned on the trust account net of taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares subject to the limitations described herein the amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be  per public share the per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters there will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may acquire during or after this offering in connection with the completion of our initial business combination the other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our initial shareholders with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering limitations on redemptions         our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules however a greater net tangible asset or cash requirement may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination for example the proposed business combination may require i cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners ii cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or iii the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination in the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all class a ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares and all class a ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof manner of conducting redemptions         we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either i in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the      table of contents     business combination or ii by means of a tender offer the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us solely in our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than  of our outstanding class a ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval we currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the sec for business or other legal reasons     if we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination we will        conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to regulation a of the exchange act which regulates the solicitation of proxies and not pursuant to the tender offer rules and        file proxy materials with the sec     if we seek shareholder approval we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination in such case our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination as a result in addition to our initial shareholders founder shares we would need  or  of the  public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the overallotment option is not exercised the other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our initial shareholders with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that at least five days notice will be given of any such shareholder meeting      table of contents     if we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the sec we will pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association        conduct the redemptions pursuant to rule e and regulation e of the exchange act which regulate issuer tender offers and        file tender offer documents with the sec prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under regulation a of the exchange act which regulates the solicitation of proxies     upon the public announcement of our initial business combination if we elect to conduct redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with rule b to purchase our class a ordinary shares in the open market in order to comply with rule e under the exchange act     in the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules our offer to redeem will remain open for at least  business days in accordance with rule ea under the exchange act and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period in addition the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem if public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination limitation on redemption rights of shareholders holding  or more of the shares sold in this offering if we hold shareholder vote         notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group as defined under section  of the exchange act will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of  of the shares sold in this offering without our prior consent we believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the thencurrent market price or on other undesirable terms absent this provision      table of contents     a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of  of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holders shares are not purchased by us our sponsor or our management at a premium to the thencurrent market price or on other undesirable terms by limiting our shareholders ability to redeem to no more than  of the shares sold in this offering we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash however we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than  of the shares sold in this offering for or against our initial business combination release of funds in trust account on closing of our initial business combination         on the completion of our initial business combination the funds held in the trust account will be used to pay amounts due to any public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights as described above under redemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our initial business combination to pay the underwriters their deferred underwriting commissions to pay all or a portion of the consideration payable to the target or owners of the target of our initial business combination and to pay other expenses associated with our initial business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of posttransaction businesses the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital redemption of public shares and distribution and liquidation if no initial business combination         our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only  months from the closing of this offering to complete our initial business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such month period we will i cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up ii as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the trust account

extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders including the right to receive further liquidation distributions if any and iii as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors dissolve and liquidate subject in the case of clauses ii and iii to our obligations under cayman islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the month time period     our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of

underwriting commission held in the trust account in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and in such event such amounts will be included with the funds held in the trust account that will be available to fund the redemption of our public shares     our sponsor executive officers directors and director nominees have agreed pursuant to a written agreement with us that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their class a ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the trust account net of taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares subject to the limitations described above under limitations on redemptions for example our board of directors may propose such an amendment if it determines that additional time is necessary to complete our initial business combination in such event we will conduct a proxy solicitation and distribute proxy materials pursuant to regulation a of the exchange act seeking shareholder      table of contents     approval of such proposal and in connection therewith provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon shareholder approval of such amendment this redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment

respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within  months      table of contents risk factors an investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully all of the risks described below together with the other information contained in this prospectus before making a decision to invest in our units if any of the following events occur our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected in that event the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment we are a recently formed company with no operating history and no revenues and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective we are a recently formed company established under the laws of the cayman islands with no operating results and we will not commence operations until obtaining funding through this offering because we lack an operating history you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination we have no plans arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination if we fail to complete our initial business combination we will never generate any operating revenues our shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination we may choose not to hold a shareholder vote before we complete our initial business combination if the business combination would not require shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement except for as required by applicable law or stock exchange requirement the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us solely in our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval accordingly we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we complete please see the section entitled proposed business  shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination for additional information your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash at the time of your investment in us you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of our initial business combination since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking shareholder approval public shareholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination unless we seek such shareholder vote accordingly your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding our initial business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time which will be at least  business days set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination our initial shareholders and management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination regardless of how our public shareholders vote our initial shareholders will own  of our outstanding ordinary shares immediately following the completion of this offering our initial shareholders and management team also may from time to time purchase class a ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that if we seek shareholder approval of an initial business combination such initial business combination will be approved if we receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares voted at such meeting including the founder shares as a result in addition to our initial shareholders founder shares we would need  or  of the  public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial      table of contents business combination approved assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the overallotment option is not exercised accordingly if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination the agreement by our initial shareholders and management team to vote in favor of our initial business combination will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite shareholder approval for such initial business combination the ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target we may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights we would not be able to meet such closing condition and as a result would not be able to proceed with the business combination furthermore in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules consequently if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination prospective targets will be aware of these risks and thus may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us the ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure at the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption if our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements or arrange for third party financing in addition if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels the above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination the pershare amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions the ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares if our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased if our initial business combination is unsuccessful you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account if you are in need of immediate liquidity you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market however at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account in either situation you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your shares in the open market      table of contents the requirement that we complete our initial business combination within  months after the closing of this offering may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets as we approach our dissolution deadline which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering consequently such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business this risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above in addition we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation we may not be able to complete our initial business combination within  months after the closing of this offering in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate we may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination within  months after the closing of this offering our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein if we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period we will i cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up ii as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the trust account less up to  of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders including the right to receive further liquidation distributions if any and iii as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors dissolve and liquidate subject in the case of clauses ii and iii to our obligations under cayman islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination our initial shareholders sponsor directors executive officers advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares or public warrants from public shareholders which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our class a ordinary shares if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our initial shareholders sponsor directors executive officers advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination although they are under no obligation to do so however other than as expressly stated herein they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions none of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions in the event that our initial shareholders sponsor directors executive officers advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares the purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met the purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any      table of contents matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible any such purchases will be reported pursuant to section  and section  of the exchange act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements see proposed business  permitted purchases of our securities for a description of how our sponsor directors executive officers advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase securities from in any private transaction in addition if such purchases are made the public float of our class a ordinary shares or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange if a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares such shares may not be redeemed we will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules as applicable when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination despite our compliance with these rules if a shareholder fails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials as applicable such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares in addition the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials as applicable that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem or tender public shares in the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these procedures its shares may not be redeemed see proposed business  business strategy  tendering share certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights you will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account except under certain limited circumstances therefore to liquidate your investment you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants potentially at a loss our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our completion of an initial business combination and then only in connection with those class a ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein ii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and iii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants accordingly to liquidate your investment you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants potentially at a loss nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions we have been approved to have our units listed on nasdaq on or promptly after the date of this prospectus and our class a ordinary shares and warrants on or promptly after their date of separation although after giving effect to this offering we expect to meet on a pro forma basis the minimum initial listing standards set forth in the nasdaq listing standards we cannot assure you that our securities will be or will continue to be listed on nasdaq in the future or prior to our initial business combination in order to continue listing our securities on nasdaq prior to our initial business combination we must maintain certain financial distribution and share price levels generally we must maintain a minimum amount in shareholders equity generally  and a minimum number of holders of our securities generally  public holders additionally in connection with our initial business combination we will be required to demonstrate compliance with nasdaqs initial listing requirements which are more rigorous than nasdaqs continued      table of contents listing requirements in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on nasdaq for instance our share price would generally be required to be at least  per share and our shareholders equity would generally be required to be at least  million we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time if nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange we expect our securities could be quoted on an overthecounter market if this were to occur we could face significant material adverse consequences including  a limited availability of market quotations for our securities  reduced liquidity for our securities  a determination that our class a ordinary shares are a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our class a ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities  a limited amount of news and analyst coverage and  a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future the national securities markets improvement act of  which is a federal statute prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities which are referred to as covered securities because we expect that our units and eventually our class a ordinary shares and warrants will be listed on nasdaq our units class a ordinary shares and warrants will qualify as covered securities under the statute although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud and if there is a finding of fraudulent activity then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case while we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies other than the state of idaho certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers or threaten to use these powers to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states further if we were no longer listed on nasdaq our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies since the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been selected we may be deemed to be a blank check company under the united states securities laws however because we will have net tangible assets in excess of   upon the completion of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and will file a current report on form k including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact we are exempt from rules promulgated by the sec to protect investors in blank check companies such as rule  accordingly investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules among other things this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to rule  moreover if this offering were subject to rule  that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination for a more detailed comparison of our offering to offerings that comply with rule  please see proposed business  comparison of this offering to those of blank check companies subject to rule  if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules and if you or a group of shareholders are deemed to hold in excess of  of our class a ordinary shares you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of  of our class a ordinary shares if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our amended and      table of contents restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group as defined under section  of the exchange act will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of  of the shares sold in this offering without our prior consent which we refer to as the excess shares however we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares including excess shares for or against our initial business combination your inability to redeem the excess shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell excess shares in open market transactions additionally you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the excess shares if we complete our initial business combination and as a result you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding  and in order to dispose of such shares would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions potentially at a loss because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders and our warrants will expire worthless we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including private investors which may be individuals or investment partnerships other blank check companies and other entities domestic and international competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire many of these individuals and entities are wellestablished and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting directly or indirectly acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors while we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses furthermore we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders and our warrants will expire worthless if the net proceeds of this offering not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next  months it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination of the net proceeds of this offering only  will be available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements we believe that upon closing of this offering the funds available to us outside of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next  months however we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate of the funds available to us we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business we could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a noshop provision a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses with respect to a particular proposed business combination although we do not have any current intention to do so if we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds whether as a result of our breach or otherwise we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for or conduct due diligence with respect to a target business      table of contents in the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of   we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account in such case the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount conversely in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of   the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount the amount held in the trust account will not be impacted as a result of such increase or decrease if we are required to seek additional capital we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate neither our sponsor members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the postbusiness combination entity at a price of   per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants prior to the completion of our initial business combination we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account if we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account consequently our public shareholders may only receive an estimated  per share or possibly less on our redemption of our public shares and our warrants will expire worthless subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination we may be required to take writedowns or writeoffs restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition results of operations and our share price which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment even if we conduct due diligence on a target business with which we combine we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues with a particular target business that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise as a result of these factors we may be forced to later writedown or writeoff assets restructure our operations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis even though these charges may be noncash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities in addition charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming preexisting debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining postcombination debt financing accordingly any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials as applicable relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission if third parties bring claims against us the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the pershare redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than  per share our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us although we will seek to have all vendors service providers prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders such parties may not execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets including the funds held in the trust account if any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust      table of contents account our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver in addition there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of or arising out of any negotiations contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason upon redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the  years following redemption accordingly the pershare redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the  per public share initially held in the trust account due to claims of such creditors pursuant to the letter agreement the form of which is filed as exhibit  to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party other than our independent public accountants for services rendered or products sold to us or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of  i  per public share and ii the actual amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than  per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets less taxes payable provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account whether or not such waiver is enforceable nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities including liabilities under the securities act however we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsors only assets are securities of our company therefore we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations none of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including without limitation claims by vendors and prospective target businesses our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders in the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of  i  per share and ii the actual amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than  per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets in each case less taxes payable and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy his obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations while we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance if our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below  per share we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law however our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account and to not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever accordingly any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if  i we have sufficient      table of contents funds outside of the trust account or ii we consummate an initial business combination our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty these provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors even though such an action if successful might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders furthermore a shareholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions if after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages if after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtorcreditor andor bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance as a result a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders in addition our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors andor having acted in bad faith thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors if before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the pershare amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced if before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders to the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account the pershare amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced if we are deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination if we are deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act our activities may be restricted including  restrictions on the nature of our investments and  restrictions on the issuance of securities each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination in addition we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements including  registration as an investment company  adoption of a specific form of corporate structure and  reporting record keeping voting proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations in order not to be regulated as an investment company under the investment company act unless we can qualify for an exclusion we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing reinvesting owning holding or trading investment securities constituting more than  of our assets exclusive of      table of contents us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the posttransaction business or assets for the long term we do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale we do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the investment company act to this end the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in united states government securities within the meaning of section a of the investment company act having a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a promulgated under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations pursuant to the trust agreement the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets by restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the investment company act this offering is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities the trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either i the completion of our initial business combination ii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering or iii absent an initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public shareholders as part of our redemption of the public shares if we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above we may be deemed to be subject to the investment company act if we were deemed to be subject to the investment company act compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders and our warrants will expire worthless changes in laws or regulations or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations may adversely affect our business including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and results of operations we are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national regional and local governments in particular we will be required to comply with certain sec and other legal requirements compliance with and monitoring of applicable laws and regulations may be difficult time consuming and costly those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business investments and results of operations in addition a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations as interpreted and applied could have a material adverse effect on our business including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and results of operations if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering our public shareholders may be forced to wait beyond such to  months before redemption from our trust account if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering the proceeds then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the trust account less up to  of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares as further described herein any redemption of public shareholders from the trust account will be effected automatically by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior to any voluntary winding up if we are required to windup liquidate the trust account and distribute such amount therein pro rata to our public shareholders as part of any liquidation process such winding up liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable provisions of the companies law in that case investors may be forced to wait beyond  months from the closing of this offering before the      table of contents redemption proceeds of our trust account become available to them and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds from our trust account we have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless we consummate our initial business combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to redeem their class a ordinary shares only upon our redemption or any liquidation will public shareholders be entitled to distributions if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares if we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business as a result a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders furthermore our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to us or our creditors andor may have acted in bad faith thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors we cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons we and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to be paid out of our share premium account while we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business would be guilty of an offence and may be liable to a fine of   and to imprisonment for five years in the cayman islands we may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders until after the consummation of our initial business combination in accordance with nasdaq corporate governance requirements we are not required to hold an annual meeting until no later than one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on nasdaq there is no requirement under the companies law for us to hold annual or general meetings to elect directors until we hold an annual meeting of shareholders public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to elect directors and to discuss company affairs with management our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of shareholders serving a threeyear term we are not registering the class a ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the securities act or any state securities laws at this time and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants and causing such warrants to expire worthless we are not registering the class a ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the securities act or any state securities laws at this time however under the terms of the warrant agreement we have agreed to use our best efforts to file a registration statement under the securities act covering such shares and maintain a current prospectus relating to the class a ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if for example any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the sec issues a stop order if the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the securities act we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis however no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder unless an exemption is available in no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the securities act or applicable state securities laws if the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless in such event      table of contents holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the class a ordinary shares included in the units if and when the warrants become redeemable by us we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws the grant of registration rights to our initial shareholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our class a ordinary shares pursuant to an agreement to be entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in this offering our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the class a ordinary shares into which founder shares are convertible holders of our private placement warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the private placement warrants and the class a ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register such warrants or the class a ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of such warrants the registration rights will be exercisable with respect to the founder shares and the private placement warrants and the class a ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such private placement warrants we will bear the cost of registering these securities the registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a ordinary shares in addition the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude this is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our class a ordinary shares that is expected when the securities owned by our initial shareholders holders of our private placement warrants or their respective permitted transferees are registered because we are neither limited to evaluating a target business in a particular industry sector nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations we will seek to complete a business combination with an operating company in the technology industry including software and services but may also pursue business combination opportunities in other industries except that we will not under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations because we have not yet selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations results of operations cash flows liquidity financial condition or prospects to the extent we complete our initial business combination we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine for example if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence furthermore some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business we also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment if such opportunity were available in a business combination target accordingly any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials as applicable relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission      table of contents because we intend to seek a business combination with a target business or businesses in the technology industry including software and services we expect our future operations to be subject to risks associated with this industry we intend to focus our search for a target business or businesses in the technology industry including software and services because we have not yet identified or approached any specific target business or industry we cannot provide specific risks of any business combination however risks inherent in investments in the technology industry include but are not limited to the following  general economic conditions in the domestic and international markets and the effect these conditions have on the availability of funding for software purchases  fluctuations in demand adoption rates sales cycles and pricing levels for technology products and services  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in customers budgets for information technology purchases and in the timing of their purchasing decisions  potential intellectual property infringement claims by other technology companies  timing of announcements of releases of new or upgraded products and services  competition and consolidation in the technology industry  ability to develop introduce and deliver in a timely manner new products and product enhancements that meet customer demand certification requirements and technical requirements  timing and amount of capitalized software development costs beginning when technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release  system security risks data protection breaches and systems integration issues and the effect these have on products and services provided to customers  ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees particularly those with relevant experience in software development and sales and  pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines and services we may seek acquisition opportunities in industries outside of the technology industry which industries may or may not be outside of our managements areas of expertise although we intend to focus on identifying business combination candidates in the technology industry including software and services we will consider a business combination outside of the technology industry if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company or we are unable to identify a suitable candidate in the technology industry after having expended a reasonable amount of time and effort in an attempt to do so although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors we also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in this offering than a direct investment if an opportunity were available in a business combination candidate in the event we elect to pursue an investment outside of the technology industry our managements expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation and the information contained herein regarding the technology industry would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire      table of contents although we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines and as a result the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes if we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines in addition if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash in addition if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders and our warrants will expire worthless we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting or investment banking firm and consequently you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm which is a member of finra that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view if no opinion is obtained our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials as applicable related to our initial business combination we may issue additional class a ordinary shares or preferred shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination we may also issue class a ordinary shares upon the conversion of the founder shares at a ratio greater than onetoone at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the antidilution provisions contained therein any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorizes the issuance of up to  class a ordinary shares par value  per share  class b ordinary shares par value  per share and  preferred shares  per share immediately after this offering there will be  and  assuming in each case that the underwriters have not exercised their overallotment option authorized but unissued class a ordinary shares and class b ordinary shares respectively available for issuance which amount does not take into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants or shares issuable upon conversion of the class b ordinary shares the class b ordinary shares are automatically convertible into class a ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination initially at a oneforone ratio but subject to adjustment as set forth herein immediately after this offering there will be no preferred shares issued and outstanding we may issue a substantial number of additional class a ordinary shares or preferred shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination we may also issue class a ordinary shares upon conversion of the class b ordinary shares at a ratio greater than onetoone at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the antidilution provisions as set forth herein however our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide among other things that prior to our initial business combination we may not issue additional shares      table of contents that would entitle the holders thereof to i receive funds from the trust account or ii vote on any initial business combination these provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may be amended with a shareholder vote the issuance of additional ordinary or preferred shares  may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering  may subordinate the rights of holders of class a ordinary shares if preferred shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our class a ordinary shares  could cause a change in control if a substantial number of class a ordinary shares are issued which may affect among other things our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards if any and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors and  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units class a ordinary shares andor warrants unlike most other similarly structured blank check companies our initial shareholders will receive additional class a ordinary shares if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination the founder shares will automatically convert into class a ordinary shares on the first business day following the consummation of our initial business combination on a oneforone basis subject to adjustment as provided herein in the case that additional class a ordinary shares or equitylinked securities convertible or exercisable for class a ordinary shares are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the closing of our initial business combination the ratio at which founder shares will convert into class a ordinary shares will be adjusted so that the number of class a ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal in the aggregate  of the sum of our ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of this offering plus the number of class a ordinary shares and equitylinked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with our initial business combination net of redemptions excluding any class a ordinary shares or equitylinked securities issued or to be issued to any seller in our initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our sponsor this is different than most other similarly structured blank check companies in which the initial shareholders will only be issued an aggregate of  of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to our initial business combination resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders and our warrants will expire worthless we anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants attorneys and others if we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable furthermore if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders and our warrants will expire worthless we may be a passive foreign investment company or pfic which could result in adverse united states federal income tax consequences to us investors if we are a pfic for any taxable year or portion thereof that is included in the holding period of a us holder as defined in the section of this prospectus captioned taxation  united states federal income tax considerations  general of our class a ordinary shares or warrants the us holder may be subject      table of contents to adverse us federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements our pfic status for our current and subsequent taxable years may depend on whether we qualify for the pfic startup exception see the section of this prospectus captioned taxation  united states federal income tax considerations  us holders  passive foreign investment company rules depending on the particular circumstances the application of the startup exception may be subject to uncertainty and there cannot be any assurance that we will qualify for the startup exception accordingly there can be no assurances with respect to our status as a pfic for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year our actual pfic status for any taxable year however will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year moreover if we determine we are a pfic for any taxable year we will endeavor to provide to a us holder such information as the internal revenue service irs may require including a pfic annual information statement in order to enable the us holder to make and maintain a qualified electing fund election but there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information and such election would be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases we urge us investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the pfic rules for a more detailed explanation of the tax consequences of pfic classification to us holders see the section of this prospectus captioned taxation  united states federal income tax considerations  us holders  passive foreign investment company rules we may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on shareholders we may in connection with our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval under the companies law reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another jurisdiction the transaction may require a shareholder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity we do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders to pay such taxes shareholders may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation after our initial business combination it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the united states and all of our assets will be located outside the united states therefore investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights it is possible that after our initial business combination a majority of our directors and officers will reside outside of the united states and all of our assets will be located outside of the united states as a result it may be difficult or in some cases not possible for investors in the united states to enforce their legal rights to effect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of united states courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under united states laws we are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and in particular our executive officers and directors we believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors at least until we have completed our initial business combination in addition our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and accordingly will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence we do not have an employment agreement with or keyman insurance on the life of any of our directors or executive officers the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us      table of contents our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel some of whom may join us following our initial business combination the loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our postcombination business our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel the role of our key personnel in the target business however cannot presently be ascertained although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following our initial business combination it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place while we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct these individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the sec which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination and a particular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel these agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous our key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments andor our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination such negotiations also could make such key personnels retention or resignation a condition to any such agreement the personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business subject to their fiduciary duties under cayman islands law we may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and as a result may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills qualifications or abilities to manage a public company when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business our ability to assess the target businesss management may be limited due to a lack of time resources or information our assessment of the capabilities of the target businesss management therefore may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills qualifications or abilities we suspected should the target businesss management not possess the skills qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company the operations and profitability of the postcombination business may be negatively impacted accordingly any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials as applicable relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination the loss of a business combination targets key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our postcombination business the role of an acquisition candidates key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidates management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place      table of contents our executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs this conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination our executive officers and directors are not required to and will not commit their full time to our affairs which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses we do not intend to have any fulltime employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities if our executive officers and directors other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination for a complete discussion of our executive officers and directors other business affairs please see management  officers directors and director nominees our officers and directors presently have and any of them in the future may have additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities and accordingly may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented following the completion of this offering and until we consummate our initial business combination we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses each of our officers and directors presently has and any of them in the future may have additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity accordingly they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us subject to their fiduciary duties under cayman islands law for a complete discussion of our executive officers and directors business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of please see management  officers directors and director nominees management  conflicts of interest and certain relationships and related party transactions our executive officers directors security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests we have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors executive officers security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest in fact we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor our directors or executive officers although we do not intend to do so nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us accordingly such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours the personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination consequently our directors and officers discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our shareholders best interest if this were the case it would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of cayman islands law and we or our shareholders might have a claim against such individuals for infringing on our shareholders rights see the section titled description of securities  certain differences in corporate law  shareholder suits for further information on the ability to bring such claims however we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason      table of contents we may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor executive officers directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest in light of the involvement of our sponsor executive officers and directors with other entities we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor executive officers directors or existing holders our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities including without limitation those described under management  conflicts of interest such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities our sponsor officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities although we will not be specifically focusing on or targeting any transaction with any affiliated entities we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination as set forth in proposed business  effecting our initial business combination  selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of finra or an independent accounting firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor executive officers directors or existing holders potential conflicts of interest still may exist and as a result the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest since our sponsor executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed other than with respect to public shares they may acquire during or after this offering a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination in august through october  we issued to our sponsor an aggregate of  founder shares in exchange for a capital contribution of   or approximately  per share in october  our sponsor transferred  founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at the same pershare purchase price paid by our sponsor the foregoing transfers of founder shares were made in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act pursuant to the socalled a½ exemption on october   we effected a share capitalization resulting in our initial shareholders holding an aggregate of  founder shares prior to the initial investment in the company of   by our sponsor the company had no assets tangible or intangible the per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued the number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the total size of this offering would be a maximum of  units if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full and therefore that such founder shares would represent  of the outstanding shares after this offering our sponsor will surrender for no consideration up to  shares depending on the extent to which the underwriters overallotment option is not exercised the founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination in addition our sponsor has committed pursuant to a written agreement to purchase an aggregate of  private placement warrants or  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full each exercisable to purchase one class a ordinary share at  per share at a price of   per warrant approximately  in the aggregate or approximately  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering the private placement warrants will expire worthless the personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following our initial business combination this risk may become more acute as the month anniversary of the closing of this offering nears which is the deadline for our completion of an initial business combination      table of contents we may issue notes or other debt securities or otherwise incur substantial debt to complete a business combination which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our shareholders investment in us although we have no commitments as of the date of this prospectus to issue any notes or other debt securities or to otherwise incur outstanding debt following this offering we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business combination we and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account as such no issuance of debt will affect the per share amount available for redemption from the trust account nevertheless the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects including  default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations  acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant  our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest if any if the debt security is payable on demand  our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding  our inability to pay dividends on our class a ordinary shares  using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our class a ordinary shares if declared expenses capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate  increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation and  limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt we may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement of warrants will provide us with  or  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full that we may use to complete our initial business combination after taking into account the  or  if the overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the trust account we may effectuate our initial business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time however we may not be able to effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the sec that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis by completing our initial business combination with only a single entity our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic competitive and regulatory developments further we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading      table of contents of risks or offsetting of losses unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry accordingly the prospects for our success may be  solely dependent upon the performance of a single business property or asset or  dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products processes or services this lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic competitive and regulatory risks any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination we may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability if we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations which may make it more difficult for us and delay our ability to complete our initial business combination with multiple business combinations we could also face additional risks including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence if there are multiple sellers and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business if we are unable to adequately address these risks it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations we may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected if at all in pursuing our business combination strategy we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company by definition very little public information generally exists about private companies and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected if at all our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination we cannot provide assurance that upon loss of control of a target business new management will possess the skills qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business we may structure our initial business combination so that the posttransaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than  of the equity interests or assets of a target business but we will only complete such business combination if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act we will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria even if the posttransaction company owns  or more of the voting securities of the target our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination for example we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new class a ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in this case we would acquire a  interest in the target however as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new class a ordinary shares our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding class a ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction in addition other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the companys shares than we initially acquired accordingly this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain control of the target business      table of contents we do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold the absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with which a substantial majority of our shareholders do not agree our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association do not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  such that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules as a result we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public shareholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor officers directors advisors or any of their affiliates in the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all class a ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares all class a ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof and we instead may search for an alternate business combination in order to effectuate an initial business combination blank check companies have in the recent past amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments including their warrant agreements we cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our shareholders may not support in order to effectuate a business combination blank check companies have in the recent past amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments including their warrant agreements for example blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination increased redemption thresholds changed industry focus and with respect to their warrants amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash andor other securities amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require at least a special resolution of our shareholders as a matter of cayman islands law meaning the approval of holders of not less than twothirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company and amending our warrant agreement will require a vote of holders of at least  of the public warrants in addition our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires us to provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within  months of the closing of this offering to the extent any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of the securities offered through this registration statement we would register or seek an exemption from registration for the affected securities the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to our prebusiness combination activity and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended with the approval of holders of not less than twothirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies it may be easier for us therefore to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions including those which relate to a companys prebusiness combination activity without approval by a certain percentage of the companys shareholders in those companies amendment of these provisions typically requires approval by between  and  of the companys public shareholders our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that any of its provisions related to prebusiness combination activity including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the private placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified      table of contents circumstances and to provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein may be amended if approved by special resolution meaning holders of not less than twothirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of  of our ordinary shares our initial shareholders who will collectively beneficially own  of our ordinary shares upon the closing of this offering assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association andor trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose as a result we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which govern our prebusiness combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association our sponsor executive officers directors and director nominees have agreed pursuant to agreements with us that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their class a ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the trust account net of taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares our shareholders are not parties to or thirdparty beneficiaries of these agreements and as a result will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor executive officers directors or director nominees for any breach of these agreements as a result in the event of a breach our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action subject to applicable law we may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders and our warrants will expire worthless although we believe that the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination because we have not yet selected any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction if the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants prove to be insufficient either because of the size of our initial business combination the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business the obligation to redeem for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms if at all the current economic environment has made it especially difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing to the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders and our warrants will expire worthless in addition even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business the failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business none of our officers directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination      table of contents our initial shareholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote potentially in a manner that you do not support upon closing of this offering our initial shareholders will own  of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering accordingly they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote potentially in a manner that you do not support including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association if our initial shareholders purchase any units in this offering or if our initial shareholders purchase any additional class a ordinary shares in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions this would increase their control neither our initial shareholders nor to our knowledge any of our officers or directors have any current intention to purchase additional securities other than as disclosed in this prospectus factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our class a ordinary shares in addition our board of directors whose members were elected by our sponsor is and will be divided into three classes each of which will generally serve for a terms for three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year we may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination if there is an annual meeting as a consequence of our staggered board of directors only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our initial shareholders because of their ownership position will have considerable influence regarding the outcome accordingly our initial shareholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our initial business combination our sponsor contributed  or approximately  per founder share and accordingly you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of our class a ordinary shares the difference between the public offering price per share allocating all of the unit purchase price to the class a ordinary share and none to the warrant included in the unit and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our class a ordinary shares after this offering constitutes the dilution to you and the other investors in this offering our sponsor acquired the founder shares at a nominal price significantly contributing to this dilution upon closing of this offering and assuming no value is ascribed to the warrants included in the units you and the other public shareholders will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately  or  per share the difference between the pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering of  and the initial offering price of  per unit this dilution would increase to the extent that the antidilution provisions of the founder shares result in the issuance of class a ordinary shares on a greater than onetoone basis upon conversion of the founder shares at the time of our initial business combination and would become exacerbated to the extent that public shareholders seek redemptions from the trust for their public shares in addition because of the antidilution protection in the founder shares any equity or equitylinked securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive to our class a ordinary shares we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants as a result the exercise price of your warrants could be increased the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of our class a ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased all without your approval our warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between continental stock transfer  trust company as warrant agent and us the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision but requires the approval by the holders of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants accordingly we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited examples of such amendments could be amendments to among other things increase the exercise price of the warrants convert the warrants into cash shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of class a ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant      table of contents we may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you thereby making your warrants worthless we have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration at a price of   per warrant provided that the closing price of our class a ordinary shares equals or exceeds  per share as adjusted for share splits share capitalizations reorganizations recapitalizations and the like for any  trading days within a  tradingday period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption provided that on the date we give notice of redemption if and when the warrants become redeemable by us we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to i exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so ii sell your warrants at the thencurrent market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or iii accept the nominal redemption price which at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants none of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees our warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination we will be issuing warrants to purchase  of our class a ordinary shares or up to  class a ordinary shares if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full as part of the units offered by this prospectus and simultaneously with the closing of this offering we will be issuing in a private placement an aggregate of  private placement warrants or  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full each exercisable to purchase one class a ordinary share at  per share in addition if our sponsor makes any working capital loans it may convert those loans into up to an additional  private placement warrants at the price of  per warrant to the extent we issue ordinary shares to effectuate a business transaction the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional class a ordinary shares upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business such warrants when exercised will increase the number of issued and outstanding class a ordinary shares and reduce the value of the class a ordinary shares issued to complete the business transaction therefore our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business because each unit contains onethird of one warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies each unit contains onethird of one warrant pursuant to the warrant agreement no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole units will trade if upon exercise of the warrants a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share we will upon exercise round down to the nearest whole number the number of class a ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder this is different from other offerings similar to ours whose units include one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one whole share we have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for onethird of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one share thus making us we believe a more attractive merger partner for target businesses nevertheless this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if it included a warrant to purchase one whole share the determination of the offering price of our units and the size of this offering is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities and size of an offering of an operating company in a particular industry you may have less assurance therefore that the offering price of our units properly reflects the value of such units than you would have in a typical offering of an operating company prior to this offering there has been no public market for any of our securities the public offering price of the units and the terms of the warrants were negotiated between us and the underwriters in determining the size of this offering management held customary organizational meetings with representatives of the      table of contents underwriters both prior to our inception and thereafter with respect to the state of capital markets generally and the amount the underwriters believed they reasonably could raise on our behalf factors considered in determining the size of this offering prices and terms of the units including the class a ordinary shares and warrants underlying the units include  the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies  prior offerings of those companies  our prospects for acquiring an operating business at attractive values  a review of debt to equity ratios in leveraged transactions  our capital structure  an assessment of our management and their experience in identifying operating companies  general conditions of the securities markets at the time of this offering and  other factors as were deemed relevant although these factors were considered the determination of our offering price is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities of an operating company in a particular industry since we have no historical operations or financial results there is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities there is currently no market for our securities shareholders therefore have no access to information about prior market history on which to base their investment decision following this offering the price of our securities may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic conditions furthermore an active trading market for our securities may never develop or if developed it may not be sustained you may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained because we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial statements we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses the federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical andor pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports we will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules these financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with or be reconciled to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap or international financing reporting standards as issued by the international accounting standards board or ifrs depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states or pcaob these financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame we are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the securities act and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies we are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the securities act as modified by the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to      table of contents not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved as a result our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important we could be an emerging growth company for up to five years although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier including if the market value of our class a ordinary shares held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of any june  before that time in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following december  we cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile further section b of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies that is those that have not had a securities act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the exchange act are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards the jobs act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to nonemerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable we have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies we as an emerging growth company can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard this may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used compliance obligations under the sarbanesoxley act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate a business combination require substantial financial and management resources and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition section  of the sarbanesoxley act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our annual report on form k for the year ending december   only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting further for as long as we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting the fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act regarding adequacy of its internal controls the development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the sarbanesoxley act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands you may face difficulties in protecting your interests and your ability to protect your rights through the us federal courts may be limited we are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon our directors or executive officers or enforce judgments obtained in the united states courts against our directors or officers our corporate affairs will be governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association the companies law as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time and the common law of the cayman islands we will also be subject to the federal securities laws of the united states the rights of shareholders to take action against the directors actions by minority shareholders      table of contents and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under cayman islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the cayman islands the common law of the cayman islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the cayman islands as well as from english common law the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority but are not binding on a court in the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the united states in particular the cayman islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the united states and certain states such as delaware may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law in addition cayman islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a federal court of the united states we have been advised by our cayman islands legal counsel that the courts of the cayman islands are unlikely i to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the united states predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states or any state and ii in original actions brought in the cayman islands to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states or any state so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature in those circumstances although there is no statutory enforcement in the cayman islands of judgments obtained in the united states the courts of the cayman islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met for a foreign judgment to be enforced in the cayman islands such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty inconsistent with a cayman islands judgment in respect of the same matter impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner or be of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the cayman islands awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy a cayman islands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere as a result of all of the above public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a united states company provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our class a ordinary shares and could entrench management our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests these provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft data corruption operational disruption andor financial loss we depend on digital technologies including information systems infrastructure and cloud applications and services including those of third parties with which we may deal sophisticated and deliberate attacks on or security breaches in our systems or infrastructure or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data as an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences we may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents it is possible that any of these occurrences or a combination of them could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss      table of contents risks associated with acquiring and operating a business in foreign countries if we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the united states for our initial business combination we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating agreeing to and completing such initial business combination and if we effect such initial business combination we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations if we pursue a target a company with operations or opportunities outside of the united states for our initial business combination we would be subject to risks associated with crossborder business combinations including in connection with investigating agreeing to and completing our initial business combination conducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction having such transaction approved by any local governments regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if we effect our initial business combination with such a company we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting including any of the following  costs and difficulties inherent in managing crossborder business operations  rules and regulations regarding currency redemption  complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals  laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected  exchange listing andor delisting requirements  tariffs and trade barriers  regulations related to customs and importexport matters  local or regional economic policies and market conditions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer payment cycles  tax issues such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the united states  currency fluctuations and exchange controls  rates of inflation  challenges in collecting accounts receivable  cultural and language differences  employment regulations  underdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems  corruption  protection of intellectual property  social unrest crime strikes riots and civil disturbances  regime changes and political upheaval  terrorist attacks and wars and  deterioration of political relations with the united states we may not be able to adequately address these additional risks if we were unable to do so we may be unable to complete such initial business combination or if we complete such combination our operations might suffer either of which may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations      table of contents if our management following our initial business combination is unfamiliar with united states securities laws they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws which could lead to various regulatory issues following our initial business combination our management may resign from their positions as officers or directors of the company and the management of the target business at the time of the business combination will remain in place management of the target business may not be familiar with united states securities laws if new management is unfamiliar with united states securities laws they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws this could be expensive and timeconsuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations after our initial business combination substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue will be derived from our operations in such country accordingly our results of operations and prospects will be subject to a significant extent to the economic political and legal policies developments and conditions in the country in which we operate the economic political and social conditions as well as government policies of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business economic growth could be uneven both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future if in the future such countrys economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected there may be less demand for spending in certain industries a decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and if we effect our initial business combination the ability of that target business to become profitable exchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished in the event we acquire a nonus target all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency and the dollar equivalent of our net assets and distributions if any could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency the value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by among other things changes in political and economic conditions any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business or following consummation of our initial business combination our financial condition and results of operations additionally if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination the cost of a target business as measured in dollars will increase which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction we may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights in connection with our initial business combination we may relocate the home jurisdiction of our business from the cayman islands to another jurisdiction if we determine to do this the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements the system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the united states the inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business business

set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify a business combination target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and

completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital there is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination including pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation of this offering we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or any of their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will reimburse our sponsor for office space secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team in an

transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants except as set forth above the terms of such loans if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans prior to the completion of our initial business combination we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account      table of contents dividend policy we have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business combination the payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings if any capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business

and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account we expect the interest earned on the amount in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes to the extent that our equity or debt is used in whole or in part as consideration to complete our initial business combination the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies prior to the completion of our initial business combination we will have available to us the  of proceeds held outside the trust account we will use these funds to primarily identify and evaluate target businesses perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses travel to and from the offices      table of contents plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses and structure negotiate and complete a business combination we do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial business combination however if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants the terms of such loans if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans prior to the completion of our initial business combination we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account we expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately  for legal accounting due diligence travel and other expenses associated with structuring negotiating and documenting successful business combinations  for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements  for consulting travel and miscellaneous expenses incurred during the search for an initial business combination target  for nasdaq continued listing fees and  for general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves we will also reimburse our sponsor for office space secretarial and administrative services provided to us in an amount not to exceed  per month  in the aggregate these amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses in addition we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a noshop provision a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses with respect to a particular proposed business combination although we do not have any current intention to do so if we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a noshop provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time our forfeiture of such funds whether as a result of our breach or otherwise could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for or conducting due diligence with respect to prospective target businesses moreover we may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account controls and procedures we are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by section  of the sarbanesoxley act we will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the sarbanesoxley act for the fiscal year ending december   only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer would we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement further for as long as we remain an      table of contents emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement prior to the closing of this offering we have not completed an assessment nor have our independent registered public accounting firm tested our systems of our internal controls we expect to assess the internal controls of our target business or businesses prior to the completion of our initial business combination and if necessary to implement and test additional controls as we may determine are necessary in order to state that we maintain an effective system of internal controls a target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act regarding the adequacy of internal controls many small and midsized target businesses we may consider for our initial business combination may have internal controls that need improvement in areas such as  staffing for financial accounting and external reporting areas including segregation of duties  reconciliation of accounts  proper recording of expenses and liabilities in the period to which they relate  evidence of internal review and approval of accounting transactions  documentation of processes assumptions and conclusions underlying significant estimates and  documentation of accounting policies and procedures because it will take time management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operation of a target business we may incur significant expenses in meeting our public reporting responsibilities particularly in the areas of designing enhancing or remediating internal and disclosure controls doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting once our managements report on internal controls is complete we will retain our independent registered public accounting firm to audit and render an opinion on such report when required by section  the independent registered public accounting firm may identify additional issues concerning a target businesss internal controls while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account will be invested in us government treasury obligations with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations due to the shortterm nature of these investments we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk offbalance sheet arrangements commitments and contractual obligations quarterly results as of august   we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item aii of regulation sk and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations no unaudited quarterly operating data is included in this prospectus as we have not conducted any operations to date jobs act the jobs act contains provisions that among other things relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies we will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the jobs act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private not publicly traded companies we are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards and as a result we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which      table of contents adoption of such standards is required for nonemerging growth companies as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates additionally we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the jobs act subject to certain conditions set forth in the jobs act if as an emerging growth company we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to among other things i provide an auditors attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section  ii provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of nonemerging growth public companies under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act iii comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the pcaob regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements auditor discussion and analysis and iv disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the ceos compensation to median employee compensation these exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company whichever is earlier      table of contents proposed business introduction we are a newly

seek to capitalize on the significant experience and contacts of our management team in consummating an initial business combination we believe our management teams distinctive background can have a transformative impact on a target business although we may pursue a business combination target in any business or industry we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify acquire and operate a business in the technology industry including software and services that may provide the opportunity to unlock the value of a private company and provide opportunities for an attractive risk adjusted return to our shareholders organizations in all industries continue to undergo rapid transformation resulting from the impact of recent technological shifts including cloud and mobile computing softwaredefined data centers sddc the rise of the practice of automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes known as the devops model heightened cybersecurity threats the challenges of managing and maintaining big data the growth in use of analytics and the adoption of software as a service saas we believe nearly every major organization currently faces and will continue to face massive disruption to legacy infrastructure and services that have failed to adapt to these technological shifts the resulting demand for these solutions has created a massive opportunity for a new breed of technology companies to provide innovative products and services that help accelerate this technology transformation a plethora of companies have developed these products and services but lack the experience or contacts necessary to navigate and accelerate the penetration of their solutions into large it departments compounding the problem

sector in  we believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive businesses within the technology industry including software and services that would benefit from access to the public markets and the skills of our management team our objective is to consummate a business combination with such a business and enhance shareholder value by improving its operational performance we believe we can achieve this objective by utilizing our founders extensive experience operating technology companies and our management teams network of contacts in the technology sector we believe many companies in the technology industry could benefit from access to the public markets but have been unable to do so due to a number of factors including the time it takes to conduct a traditional initial public offering market volatility and pricing uncertainty we will focus on established companies with a leading competitive position a strong management team a collaborative and collegial culture a robust financial profile and strong longterm potential for profitability the past performance of our founders and other members of our management team is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate you should not rely on the historical record of our managements performance as indicative of our future performance none of our officers or directors has any past experience with any blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies initial business combination nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least  of the value of the assets held in the trust account excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination if our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of finra or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria our shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion we anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire  of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses we may however structure our initial business combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than  of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons but we will only complete such business combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended or the investment company act even if the post transaction company owns or acquires  or more of the voting securities of the target our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination for example we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in this case we would acquire a  controlling interest in the target however as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination if less than  of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post transaction company the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of nasdaqs  of net assets test if the business combination involves more than one target business the  of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions      table of contents consistent with our business strategy we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses we will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines  focus on technology industry including software and services   based upon our management teams experience we believe we will have access to deal flow and a competitive advantage in our ability to negotiate a business combination with potential targets in the technology industry our management teams extensive experience and vast network of technology leaders provides them with a differentiated opportunity to source a target validate a potential targets technology consummate a business combination with the target and help sell the targets products and services into large enterprises  established target with a history of andor capacity for free cash flow generation   we will target one or more businesses that have exhibited profitability historically andor have the potential for strong cash flow generation in the future we have a history of accelerating growth of companies with strong historical performance  fundamentally sound companies that have the potential to further improve their performance under our guidance   we believe our experience in the sector will provide validation for the targets product and network of industry contacts will allow us to enhance sales and generate a higher return for our investors  marketleading technology   we will seek a target that has a technology recognized as the clear leader in its subsector  experienced and motivated management team   we will seek a target with an established management team that we intend to complement not replace to the extent we believe it will enhance shareholder value we would seek to selectively supplement the existing management team of the business including senior management with proven leaders from our network  at an inflection point   we believe numerous technology companies lack the ability to penetrate large companies it departments potentially limiting their acceleration to attain the scale required to be a publiclylisted company or lack the validation of large it organizations we will target a company that may require additional management expertise as it transitions to a public company or where we believe our background can provide the validation necessary to drive improved financial performance  may benefit from capital markets access   we will seek a target that may benefit from the use of additional capital to drive growth or from a public currency to acquire competitors and grow revenue these criteria are not intended to be exhaustive any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based to the extent relevant on these general guidelines as well as other considerations factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant in the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination which as discussed in this prospectus would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the sec our business combination process in evaluating a prospective target business we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass among other things meetings with incumbent management and employees document reviews and inspection of facilities as applicable as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us we are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor officers or directors in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor officers or directors we or a committee of independent      table of contents directors will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of finra or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view members of our management team and our independent directors will directly or indirectly own founder shares andor private placement warrants following this offering and accordingly may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination further each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination each of our officers and directors presently has and any of them in the future may have additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity accordingly if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity subject to their fiduciary duties under cayman islands law we do not believe however that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination our sponsor officers and directors have agreed pursuant to a written letter agreement not to participate in the formation of or become an officer or director of any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within  months after the closing of this offering prior to the date of this prospectus we will file a registration statement on form a with the sec to voluntarily register our securities under section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act as a result we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the exchange act we have no current intention of filing a form  to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the exchange act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination status as a public company we believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses as an existing public company we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us in a business combination transaction with us the owners of the target business may for example exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our class a ordinary shares or shares of a new holding company or for a combination of our class a ordinary shares and cash allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering the typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process including underwriting discounts and commissions that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us furthermore once a proposed business combination is completed the target business will have effectively become public whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering as well as general market conditions which could prevent the offering from occurring once public we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees      table of contents while we believe that our structure and our management teams backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination negatively we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act we will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of  the last day of the fiscal year a following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering b in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least  billion or c in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer which means the market value of our class a ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the prior june  th  and  the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior threeyear period financial position with funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of  after payment of  of deferred underwriting fees or  after payment of  of deferred underwriting fees if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash debt or equity securities or a combination of the foregoing we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires however we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us effecting our initial business combination general we are not presently engaged in and we will not engage in any operations for an indefinite period of time following this offering we intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of this offering or otherwise shares issued to the owners of the target debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target or a combination of the foregoing we may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses if our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our class a ordinary shares we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we have not selected any business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions with any business combination target additionally we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate to conduct any research or take any measures directly or indirectly to locate or contact a target business other than our officers and directors accordingly there is no current basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter furthermore some of those risks may be outside of our control meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business      table of contents we may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination there are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination we are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities the incurrence of debt or otherwise sources of target businesses we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources including investment bankers and private investment funds target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings these sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis since many of these sources will have read this prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting our officers and directors as well as their affiliates may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have as well as attending trade shows or conventions in addition we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors while we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future in which event we may pay a finders fee consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arms length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction we will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue payment of a finders fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account in no event however will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors or any entity with which they are affiliated be paid any finders fee consulting fee or other compensation by the company prior to or for any services they render in order to effectuate the completion of our initial business combination regardless of the type of transaction that it is none of our sponsor executive officers or directors or any of their respective affiliates will be allowed to receive any compensation finders fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated acquisition of such target by us we are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor officers or directors or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor officers or directors in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor executive officers or directors we or a committee of independent directors would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking which is a member of finra or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view we are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context evaluation of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination in evaluating a prospective target business we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass among other things meetings with incumbent management and employees document reviews interviews of customers and suppliers inspection of facilities as applicable as well as a review of financial operational legal and other information which will be made available to us if we determine to move forward with a particular target we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction the time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination and the costs associated with this process are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of and negotiation      table of contents with a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination the company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team or any of their respective affiliates for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination lack of business diversification for an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business by completing our initial business combination with only a single entity our lack of diversification may  subject us to negative economic competitive and regulatory developments any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination and  cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services limited ability to evaluate the targets management team although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct in addition the future management may not have the necessary skills qualifications or abilities to manage a public company furthermore the future role of members of our management team if any in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty the determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination while it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination moreover we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business we cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company the determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination following a business combination we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business we cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers or that additional managers will have the requisite skills knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination we may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the sec subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association however we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons under nasdaqs listing rules shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if for example  we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of  of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding other than in a public offering  any of our directors officers or substantial shareholders as defined by nasdaq rules has a  or greater interest earned on the trust account or such persons collectively have a  or greater      table of contents interest directly or indirectly in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of  or more or  the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control permitted purchases of our securities if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our initial shareholders sponsor directors executive officers advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions none of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act in the event that our initial shareholders sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules the purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to i vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or ii to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met the purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible in addition if such purchases are made the public float of our class a ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange our initial shareholders sponsor officers directors andor their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our initial shareholders officers directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders in the case of class a ordinary shares following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination to the extent that our sponsor officers directors advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the shareholder meeting related to our initial business combination our sponsor executive officers directors advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with regulation m under the exchange act and the other federal securities laws      table of contents our sponsor officers directors andor their affiliates will not make purchases of shares if the purchases would violate section a or rule b of the exchange act any such purchases will be reported pursuant to section  and section  of the exchange act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements redemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our initial business combination we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their class a ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination including interest earned on the trust account net of taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares subject to the limitations described herein the amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be  per public share the per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination the other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our initial shareholders with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering limitations on redemptions our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules however the proposed business combination may require i cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners ii cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or iii the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination in the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all class a ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares and all class a ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof manner of conducting redemptions we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their class a ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either i in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or ii by means of a tender offer the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us solely in our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under sec rules asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than  of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval we currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the sec for business or other legal reasons if we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination we will pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association  conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to regulation a of the exchange act which regulates the solicitation of proxies and not pursuant to the tender offer rules and  file proxy materials with the sec      table of contents in the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination we will distribute proxy materials and in connection therewith provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek shareholder approval we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination in such case our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination as a result in addition to our initial shareholders founder shares we would need  or  of the  public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the overallotment option is not exercised each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction in addition our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination the other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our initial shareholders with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering if we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the sec we will pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association  conduct the redemptions pursuant to rule e and regulation e of the exchange act which regulate issuer tender offers and  file tender offer documents with the sec prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under regulation a of the exchange act which regulates the solicitation of proxies upon the public announcement of our initial business combination we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with rule b to purchase class a ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer to comply with rule e under the exchange act in the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules our offer to redeem will remain open for at least  business days in accordance with rule ea under the exchange act and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period in addition the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem if public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete our initial business combination limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek shareholder approval if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group as defined under section  of the exchange act will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to excess shares we believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the thencurrent market price or on other undesirable terms absent this provision a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of  of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us our sponsor or our management at a premium to the thencurrent market price or on other undesirable terms by limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than  of the shares sold in this offering without our prior consent we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to      table of contents complete our initial business combination particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash however we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares including excess shares for or against our initial business combination tendering share certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name will be required to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials as applicable mailed to such holders or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the depository trust companys dwac depositwithdrawal at custodian system at the holders option the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials as applicable that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements accordingly a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials as applicable to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares there is a nominal cost associated with the abovereferenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the dwac system the transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately  and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder however this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares the need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated the foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies in order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders vote on an initial business combination and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights after the business combination was approved the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership as a result the shareholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys shares in the market if the price rose above the redemption price he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation as a result the redemption rights to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate the requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved any request to redeem such shares once made may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials as applicable furthermore if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate physically or electronically it is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination if our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account in such case we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares      table of contents if our initial proposed business combination is not completed we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until  months from the closing of this offering redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provided that we will have only  months from the closing of this offering to complete our initial business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such month period we will i cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up ii as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the trust account less up to  of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders including the right to receive further liquidation distributions if any and iii as promptly as reasonably possible following such

to provide for claims of creditors in all cases subject to and the other requirements of applicable law there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the month time period our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering however if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted month time period our sponsor executive officers directors and director nominees have agreed pursuant to a written agreement with us that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the trust account net of taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares however we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules if this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution as well as payments to any creditors will be funded from amounts remaining out of the  of proceeds held outside the trust account although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose we will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to provide us with additional working capital we will need to identify and complete one or more initial business combinations as well as to pay any tax obligations that we may owe however if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to  of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses if we were to expend all of the net proceeds of this offering other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account and without taking into account interest if any earned on the trust account the pershare redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be  the proceeds deposited in the trust account could however become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders we cannot assure you that the actual pershare redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than  while we intend to pay such amounts if any we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims      table of contents although we will seek to have all vendors service providers prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets including the funds held in the trust account if any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver in addition there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of or arising out of any negotiations contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason in order to protect the amounts held in the trust account our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party other than our independent public accountants for services rendered or products sold to us or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of i  per public share and ii the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than  per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets less taxes payable provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account whether or not such waiver is enforceable nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities including liabilities under the securities act however we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsors only assets are securities of our company therefore we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations none of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including without limitation claims by vendors and prospective target businesses in the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of i  per public share and ii the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than  per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets in each case less taxes payable and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations while we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance accordingly we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the pershare redemption price will not be less than  per share we will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors service providers prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities including liabilities under the securities act we will have access to up to  from the proceeds of this offering with which to pay any such potential claims including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation currently estimated to be no more than approximately  in the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors in the event that our offering      table of contents expenses exceed our estimate of  we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account in such case the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount conversely in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of  the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders to the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account we cannot assure you we will be able to return  per share to our public shareholders additionally if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtorcreditor andor bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance as a result a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders furthermore our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors andor may have acted in bad faith and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors we cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons our public

experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of      table of contents these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a

have agreed to vote their founder shares and they and the other members of our management team have agreed to vote any shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination limitation on liability and indemnification of officers and directors cayman islands law does not limit the extent to which a companys amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors except to the extent any such provision may be held by the cayman islands courts to be contrary to public policy such as to provide indemnification against willful default fraud or the consequences of committing a crime our amended and      table of contents restated memorandum and articles of association will provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such except through their own actual fraud willful default or willful neglect we expect to purchase a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account and have agreed to waive any right title interest or claim of any kind they may have in the future as a result of or arising out of any services provided to us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever accordingly any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied by us if  i we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or ii we consummate an initial business combination our indemnification obligations may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty these provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors even though such an action if successful might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders furthermore a shareholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our

another company our board of directors is divided into three classes each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year there is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors with the result that the holders of more than  of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors our

offering unlike many blank check companies that hold shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law if a shareholder vote is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a

shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules if we seek shareholder approval we will complete our initial business combination only if a      table of contents majority of the ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of our initial business combination however the participation of our sponsor officers directors advisors or their affiliates in privatelynegotiated transactions as described in this prospectus if any could result in the approval of our initial business combination even if a majority of our public

no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that at least five days notice will be given of any general meeting if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the

shareholder is acting in concert or as a group as defined under section  of the exchange act will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to excess shares however we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares including excess shares for or against our initial business combination our shareholders inability to redeem the excess shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and such shareholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such excess shares on the open market additionally such shareholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the excess shares if we complete our initial business combination and as a result such shareholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding  and in order to dispose such shares would be required to sell their shares in open market transactions potentially at a loss if we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of

account including interest earned on the trust account less up to  of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders including the right to receive further liquidation distributions if any subject to applicable law and iii as promptly

raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted and a member registered in the register of members will be deemed as a matter of cayman islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members upon the closing of this public offering the register of members will be immediately updated to reflect the issue of shares by us once our register of members has been updated the shareholders recorded in the register of members will be deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name however there are certain limited circumstances where an application may be made to a cayman islands court for a determination on whether the register of members reflects the correct legal position further the cayman islands court has the power to order that the register of members maintained by a company should be rectified where it considers that the register of members does not reflect the correct legal position if an application for an order for rectification of the register of members were made in respect of our ordinary shares then the validity of such shares may be subject to reexamination by a cayman islands court preferred shares our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize  preferred shares and provide that preferred shares may be issued from time to time in one or more series our board of directors will be authorized to fix the voting rights if any designations powers preferences the relative participating optional or other special rights and any qualifications limitations and restrictions thereof applicable to the shares of each series our board of directors will be able to without shareholder approval issue preferred shares with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the ordinary shares and could have antitakeover effects the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management we have no preferred shares outstanding at the date hereof although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of preferred shares we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future no preferred shares are being issued or registered in this offering warrants public shareholders warrants each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one class a ordinary share at a price of  per share subject to adjustment as discussed below at any time commencing on the later of one year from the closing of this offering or  days after the completion of our initial business combination provided in each case that we have an effective registration statement under the securities act covering the class a ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available or we permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the warrant agreement and such shares are registered qualified or exempt from registration under the securities or blue sky laws of the state of residence of the holder pursuant to the warrant agreement a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of class a ordinary shares this means only a whole warrant may be exercised at a given time by a warrant holder no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade accordingly unless you purchase at least three units you will not be able to receive or trade a whole warrant the warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination at  pm new york city time or earlier upon redemption or liquidation      table of contents we will not be obligated to deliver any class a ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the securities act with respect to the class a ordinary shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration no warrant will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue a class a ordinary share upon exercise of a warrant unless the class a ordinary share issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants in the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless in no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant in the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the class a ordinary share underlying such unit we have agreed that as soon as practicable but in no event later than fifteen  business days after the closing of our initial business combination we will use our best efforts to file with the sec a registration statement for the registration under the securities act of the class a ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants we will use our best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating thereto until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement if a registration statement covering the class a ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the sixtieth  th  day after the closing of our initial business combination warrant holders may until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with section a of the securities act or another exemption once the warrants become exercisable we may call the warrants for redemption  in whole and not in part  at a price of   per warrant  upon not less than  days prior written notice of redemption the day redemption period to each warrant holder and  if and only if the reported closing price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds  per share as adjusted for share splits share capitalizations reorganizations recapitalizations and the like for any  trading days within a trading day period ending three business days before we send to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders if and when the warrants become redeemable by us we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws we have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price if the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date however the price of the class a ordinary shares may fall below the  redemption trigger price as adjusted for share splits share capitalizations reorganizations recapitalizations and the like as well as the  warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued if we call the warrants for redemption as described above our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his her or its warrant to do so on a cashless basis in determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis our management will consider among other factors our cash position the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our shareholders of issuing the maximum number of class a ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of our warrants if our management takes advantage of this option all holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of class a ordinary shares equal to the      table of contents quotient obtained by dividing x the product of the number of class a ordinary shares underlying the warrants multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value defined below by y the fair market value the fair market value will mean the average reported closing price of the class a ordinary shares for the  trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants if our management takes advantage of this option the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of class a ordinary shares to be received upon exercise of the warrants including the fair market value in such case requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption we believe this feature is an attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants after our initial business combination if we call our warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this option the holders of the private placement warrants and their permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their private placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis as described in more detail below a holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise such person together with such persons affiliates to the warrant agents actual knowledge would beneficially own in excess of  or  as specified by the holder of the class a ordinary shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise if the number of outstanding class a ordinary shares is increased by a share dividend payable in class a ordinary shares or by a splitup of ordinary shares or other similar event then on the effective date of such share dividend splitup or similar event the number of class a ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding ordinary shares a rights offering to holders of ordinary shares entitling holders to purchase class a ordinary shares at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a share dividend of a number of class a ordinary shares equal to the product of  i the number of class a ordinary shares actually sold in such rights offering or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for class a ordinary shares and ii the quotient of  x the price per class a ordinary share paid in such rights offering and y the fair market value for these purposes i if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for class a ordinary shares in determining the price payable for class a ordinary shares there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and ii fair market value means the volume weighted average price of class a ordinary shares as reported during the ten  trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the class a ordinary shares trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market regular way without the right to receive such rights in addition if we at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash securities or other assets to the holders of class a ordinary shares on account of such class a ordinary shares or other securities into which the warrants are convertible other than a as described above b certain ordinary cash dividends c to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of class a ordinary shares in connection with a proposed initial business combination or d in connection with the redemption of our public shares upon our failure to complete our initial business combination then the warrant exercise price will be decreased effective immediately after the effective date of such event by the amount of cash andor the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each class a ordinary share in respect of such event if the number of outstanding class a ordinary shares is decreased by a consolidation combination reverse share split or reclassification of class a ordinary shares or other similar event then on the effective date of such consolidation combination reverse share split reclassification or similar event the number of class a ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding class a ordinary shares      table of contents whenever the number of class a ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted as described above the warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction x the numerator of which will be the number of class a ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment and y the denominator of which will be the number of class a ordinary shares so purchasable immediately thereafter in case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding class a ordinary shares other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such class a ordinary shares or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our outstanding class a ordinary shares or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the class a ordinary shares immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby the kind and amount of class a ordinary shares or other securities or property including cash receivable upon such reclassification reorganization merger or consolidation or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event if less than  of the consideration receivable by the holders of class a ordinary shares in such a transaction is payable in the form of class a ordinary shares in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established overthecounter market or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the warrant agreement based on the blackscholes warrant value as defined in the warrant agreement of the warrant the purpose of such exercise price reduction is to provide additional value to holders of the warrants when an extraordinary transaction occurs during the exercise period of the warrants pursuant to which the holders of the warrants otherwise do not receive the full potential value of the warrants the warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between continental stock transfer  trust company as warrant agent and us the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision but requires the approval by the holders of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders you should review a copy of the warrant agreement which will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the warrants the warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated accompanied by full payment of the exercise price or on a cashless basis if applicable by certified or official bank check payable to us for the number of warrants being exercised the warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive class a ordinary shares after the issuance of class a ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants if upon exercise of the warrants a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share we will upon exercise round down to the nearest whole number the number of class a ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder private placement warrants the private placement warrants including the class a ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants will not be transferable assignable or salable until  days after the completion of our initial business combination except among other limited exceptions as described under principal shareholders  transfers of founder shares and private placement warrants to our officers and directors      table of contents and other persons or entities affiliated with the initial purchasers of the private placement warrants and they will not be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees our sponsor or its permitted transferees has the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless basis except as described below the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering if the private placement warrants are held by holders other than our sponsor or its permitted transferees the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering if holders of the private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis they would pay the exercise price by surrendering his her or its warrants for that number of class a ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing x the product of the number of class a ordinary shares underlying the warrants multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value defined below by y the fair market value the fair market value will mean the average reported closing price of the class a ordinary shares for the  trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent the reason that we have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by our sponsor and permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether they will be affiliated with us following a business combination if they remain affiliated with us their ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited we expect to have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of time even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell our securities an insider cannot trade in our securities if he or she is in possession of material nonpublic information accordingly unlike public shareholders who could exercise their warrants and sell the class a ordinary shares received upon such exercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities as a result we believe that allowing the holders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of   per warrant at the option of the lender such warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants our sponsor has agreed not to transfer assign or sell any of the private placement warrants including the class a ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of any of these warrants until the date that is  days after the date we complete our initial business combination except that among other limited exceptions as described under principal shareholders  transfers of founder shares and private placement warrants transfers can be made to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with our sponsor dividends we have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of a business combination the payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings if any capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination the payment of any cash dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time if we increase the size of this offering then we will effect a share capitalization with respect to our founder shares immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares at  of our issued and outstanding shares of our ordinary shares upon the consummation of this offering further if we incur any indebtedness our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith our transfer agent and warrant agent the transfer agent for our ordinary shares and warrant agent for our warrants is continental stock transfer  trust company we have agreed to indemnify continental stock transfer  trust company in its roles as transfer agent and warrant agent its agents and each of its shareholders directors officers and      table of contents employees against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity except for any claims and losses due to any gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnified person or entity continental stock transfer  trust company has agreed that it has no right of setoff or any right title interest or claim of any kind to or to any monies in the trust account and has irrevocably waived any right title interest or claim of any kind to or to any monies in the trust account that it may have now or in the future accordingly any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied or a claim will only be able to be pursued solely against us and our assets outside the trust account and not against the any monies in the trust account or interest earned thereon certain differences in corporate law cayman islands companies are governed by the companies law the companies law is modeled on english law but does not follow recent english law statutory enactments and differs from laws applicable to united states corporations and their shareholders set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the provisions of the companies law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the united states and their shareholders mergers and similar arrangements   in certain circumstances the companies law allows for mergers or consolidations between two cayman islands companies or between a cayman islands exempted company and a company incorporated in another jurisdiction provided that is facilitated by the laws of that other jurisdiction where the merger or consolidation is between two cayman islands companies the directors of each company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation containing certain prescribed information that plan or merger or consolidation must then be authorized by either a a special resolution usually a majority of    in value of the voting shares voted at a general meeting of the shareholders of each company or b such other authorization if any as may be specified in such constituent companys articles of association a shareholder has the right to vote on a merger or consolidation regardless of whether the shares that he holds otherwise give him voting rights no shareholder resolution is required for a merger between a parent company ie a company that owns at least  of the issued shares of each class in a subsidiary company and its subsidiary company the consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest of a constituent company must be obtained unless the court waives such requirement if the cayman islands registrar of companies is satisfied that the requirements of the companies law which includes certain other formalities have been complied with the registrar of companies will register the plan of merger or consolidation where the merger or consolidation involves a foreign company the procedure is similar save that with respect to the foreign company the directors of the cayman islands exempted company are required to make a declaration to the effect that having made due enquiry they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met i that the merger or consolidation is permitted or not prohibited by the constitutional documents of the foreign company and by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the foreign company is incorporated and that those laws and any requirements of those constitutional documents have been or will be complied with ii that no petition or other similar proceeding has been filed and remains outstanding or order made or resolution adopted to wind up or liquidate the foreign company in any jurisdictions iii that no receiver trustee administrator or other similar person has been appointed in any jurisdiction and is acting in respect of the foreign company its affairs or its property or any part thereof and iv that no scheme order compromise or other similar arrangement has been entered into or made in any jurisdiction whereby the rights of creditors of the foreign company are and continue to be suspended or restricted where the surviving company is the cayman islands exempted company the directors of the cayman islands exempted company are further required to make a declaration to the effect that having made due enquiry they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met i that the foreign company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and that the merger or consolidated is bona fide and not intended to defraud unsecured creditors of the foreign company ii that in respect of the transfer of any security interest granted by the foreign company to the surviving or consolidated company a consent or approval to the transfer has been obtained released or waived b the transfer is permitted by and has been      table of contents approved in accordance with the constitutional documents of the foreign company and c the laws of the jurisdiction of the foreign company with respect to the transfer have been or will be complied with iii that the foreign company will upon the merger or consolidation becoming effective cease to be incorporated registered or exist under the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction and iv that there is no other reason why it would be against the public interest to permit the merger or consolidation where the above procedures are adopted the companies law provides for a right of dissenting shareholders to be paid a payment of the fair value of his shares upon their dissenting to the merger or consolidation if they follow a prescribed procedure in essence that procedure is as follows a the shareholder must give his written objection to the merger or consolidation to the constituent company before the vote on the merger or consolidation including a statement that the shareholder proposes to demand payment for his shares if the merger or consolidation is authorized by the vote b within  days following the date on which the merger or consolidation is approved by the shareholders the constituent company must give written notice to each shareholder who made a written objection c a shareholder must within  days following receipt of such notice from the constituent company give the constituent company a written notice of his intention to dissent including among other details a demand for payment of the fair value of his shares d within seven days following the date of the expiration of the period set out in paragraph b above or seven days following the date on which the plan of merger or consolidation is filed whichever is later the constituent company the surviving company or the consolidated company must make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the fair value and if the company and the shareholder agree the price within  days following the date on which the offer was made the company must pay the shareholder such amount and e if the company and the shareholder fail to agree a price within such  day period within  days following the date on which such  day period expires the company and any dissenting shareholder must file a petition with the cayman islands grand court to determine the fair value and such petition must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of the dissenting shareholders with whom agreements as to the fair value of their shares have not been reached by the company at the hearing of that petition the court has the power to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of interest if any to be paid by the company upon the amount determined to be the fair value any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the list filed by the company may participate fully in all proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached these rights of a dissenting shareholder are not available in certain circumstances for example to dissenters holding shares of any class in respect of which an open market exists on a recognized stock exchange or recognized interdealer quotation system at the relevant date or where the consideration for such shares to be contributed are shares of any company listed on a national securities exchange or shares of the surviving or consolidated company moreover cayman islands law has separate statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances schemes of arrangement will generally be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions involving widely held companies commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a scheme of arrangement which may be tantamount to a merger in the event that a merger was sought pursuant to a scheme of arrangement the procedures for which are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states the arrangement in question must be approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent threefourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors as the case may be that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting or meeting summoned for that purpose the convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the grand court of the cayman islands while a dissenting shareholder would have the right to express to the court the view that the transaction should not be approved the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies itself that  we are not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of our corporate authority and the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with  the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question      table of contents  the arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve and  the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the companies law or that would amount to a fraud on the minority if a scheme of arrangement or takeover offer as described below is approved any dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of united states corporations squeezeout provisions   when a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of  of the shares to whom the offer is made within four months the offeror may within a twomonth period require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer an objection can be made to the grand court of the cayman islands but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud bad faith collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders further transactions similar to a merger reconstruction andor an amalgamation may in some circumstances be achieved through means other than these statutory provisions such as a share capital exchange asset acquisition or control or through contractual arrangements of an operating business shareholders suits   our cayman islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action having been brought in a cayman islands court derivative actions have been brought in the cayman islands courts and the cayman islands courts have confirmed the availability for such actions in most cases we will be the proper plaintiff in any claim based on a breach of duty owed to us and a claim against for example our officers or directors usually may not be brought by a shareholder however based both on cayman islands authorities and on english authorities which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority and be applied by a court in the cayman islands exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which  a company is acting or proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of its authority  the act complained of although not beyond the scope of the authority could be effected if duly authorized by more than the number of votes which have actually been obtained or  those who control the company are perpetrating a fraud on the minority a shareholder may have a direct right of action against us where the individual rights of that shareholder have been infringed or are about to be infringed enforcement of civil liabilities   the cayman islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the united states and provides less protection to investors additionally cayman islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states we have been advised by our cayman islands legal counsel that the courts of the cayman islands are unlikely i to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the united states predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states or any state and ii in original actions brought in the cayman islands to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states or any state so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature in those circumstances although there is no statutory enforcement in the cayman islands of judgments obtained in the united states the courts of the cayman islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met for a foreign judgment to be enforced in the cayman islands such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty inconsistent with a cayman islands judgment in respect of the same matter impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner and or be of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the cayman islands awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy a cayman islands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere      table of contents special considerations for exempted companies   we are an exempted company with limited liability meaning our public shareholders have no liability as members of the company for liabilities of the company over and above the amount paid for their shares under the companies law the companies law distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies any company that is registered in the cayman islands but conducts business mainly outside of the cayman islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company the requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an ordinary company except for the exemptions and privileges listed below  annual reporting requirements are minimal and consist mainly of a statement that the company has conducted its operations mainly outside of the cayman islands and has complied with the provisions of the companies law  an exempted companys register of members is not open to inspection  an exempted company does not have to hold an annual general meeting  an exempted company may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value  an exempted company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation such undertakings are usually given for  years in the first instance  an exempted company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the cayman islands  an exempted company may register as a limited duration company and  an exempted company may register as a segregated portfolio company amended and restated memorandum and articles of association article  of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contains provisions designed to provide certain rights and protections relating to this offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination these provisions cannot be amended without a special resolution as a matter of cayman islands law a resolution is deemed to be a special resolution where it has been approved by either i at least twothirds or any higher threshold specified in a companys articles of association of a companys shareholders at a general meeting for which notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been given or ii if so authorized by a companys articles of association by a unanimous written resolution of all of the companys shareholders our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that special resolutions must be approved either by at least twothirds of our shareholders ie the lowest threshold permissible under cayman islands law or by a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders our initial shareholders who will collectively beneficially own  of our ordinary shares upon the closing of this offering assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose specifically our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide among other things that  if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering we will i cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up ii as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the trust account less up to  of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders including the right to receive further liquidation distributions if any and iii as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors dissolve and liquidate subject in the case of clauses ii and iii to our obligations under cayman islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law      table of contents  prior to our initial business combination we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to i receive funds from the trust account or ii vote on our initial business combination  although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor our directors or our executive officers we are not prohibited from doing so in the event we enter into such a transaction we or a committee of independent directors will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of finra or an independent accounting firm that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view  if a shareholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons we will

united states federal income tax considerations general the following discussion summarizes certain united states federal income tax considerations associated with the acquisition ownership and disposition of our units each consisting of one class a ordinary share and onethird of one redeemable warrant that are purchased in this offering by us holders as defined below and nonus holders as defined below because the components of a unit are generally separable at the option of the holder the holder of a unit generally should be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as the owner of the underlying class a ordinary share and warrant components of the unit as a result the discussion below with respect to actual holders of class a ordinary shares and warrants should also apply to holders of units as the deemed owners of the underlying class a ordinary shares and warrants that constitute the units this discussion is limited to certain united states federal income tax considerations to beneficial owners of our securities who are initial purchasers of a unit pursuant to this offering and hold the unit and each component of the unit as a capital asset under the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code this discussion assumes that the class a ordinary shares and warrants will trade separately and that any distributions made or deemed made by us on our class a ordinary shares and any consideration received or deemed received by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition of our securities will be in us dollars this discussion is a summary only and does not consider all aspects of united states federal income taxation that may be relevant to the acquisition ownership and disposition of a unit by a prospective investor in light of its particular circumstances including  financial institutions or financial services entities  brokerdealers  taxpayers that are subject to the marktomarket tax accounting rules  taxexempt entities  governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof  insurance companies  regulated investment companies  real estate investment trusts  expatriates or former longterm residents of the united states  persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more of our voting shares  persons that acquired our securities pursuant to an exercise of employee share options in connection with employee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation  persons that hold our securities as part of a straddle constructive sale hedging conversion or other integrated or similar transaction or  us holders as defined below whose functional currency is not the us dollar moreover the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the code the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof all as of the date hereof and such provisions may be repealed revoked modified or subject to differing interpretations possibly on a retroactive basis so as to result in united states federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below furthermore this discussion does not address any aspect of us federal nonincome tax laws such as gift estate or medicare contribution tax laws or state local or nonus tax laws we have not sought and will not seek a ruling from the irs as to any united states federal income tax consequence described herein the irs may disagree with the discussion herein and its determination may be upheld by a court moreover there can be no assurance that future legislation regulations administrative rulings or court decisions will not adversely affect the accuracy of the statements in this discussion      table of contents as used herein the term us holder means a beneficial owner of units class a ordinary shares or warrants that is for united states federal income tax purposes i an individual citizen or resident of the united states ii a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for united states federal income tax purposes that is created or organized or treated as created or organized in or under the laws of the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia iii an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source or iv a trust if  a a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or b it has in effect a valid election to be treated as a us person this discussion does not consider the tax treatment of partnerships or other passthrough entities or persons who hold our securities through such entities if a partnership or other entity classified as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes is the beneficial owner of our securities the united states federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership if you are a partner of a partnership holding our securities we urge you to consult your own tax advisor this discussion is only a summary of certain united states federal income tax considerations associated with the acquisition ownership and disposition of our securities each prospective investor in our securities is urged to consult its own tax advisor with respect to the particular tax consequences to such investor of the acquisition ownership and disposition of our securities including the applicability and effect of any state local and nonus tax laws allocation of purchase price and characterization of a unit no statutory administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments similar to a unit for united states federal income tax purposes and therefore that treatment is not entirely clear the acquisition of a unit should be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as the acquisition of one share of our class a ordinary shares and onethird of one warrant each whole warrant is exercisable to acquire one of our class a ordinary shares we intend to treat the acquisition of a unit in this manner and by purchasing a unit you will agree to adopt such treatment for tax purposes for united states federal income tax purposes each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between the one class a ordinary share and the onethird of one warrant based on the relative fair market value of each at the time of issuance the price allocated to each class a ordinary share and the onethird of one warrant should be the shareholders tax basis in such share or warrant any disposition of a unit should be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the class a ordinary share and onethird of one warrant comprising the unit and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the class a ordinary share and warrant based on their respective fair market values the separation of the class a ordinary share and the onethird of one warrant constituting a unit should not be a taxable event for united states federal income tax purposes the foregoing treatment of the units class a ordinary shares and warrants and a holders purchase price allocation are not binding on the irs or the courts because there are no authorities that directly address instruments that are similar to the units no assurance can be given that the irs or the courts will agree with the characterization described above or the discussion below accordingly each prospective investor is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in a unit including alternative characterizations of a unit the balance of this discussion assumes that the characterization of the units described above is respected for united states federal income tax purposes us holders taxation of distributions subject to the passive foreign investment company pfic rules discussed below a us holder generally will be required to include in gross income as dividends the amount of any cash distribution paid on our class a ordinary shares to the extent the distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings      table of contents and profits as determined under united states federal income tax principles such dividends paid by us will be taxable to a corporate us holder at regular rates and will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of dividends received from other domestic corporations distributions in excess of such earnings and profits generally will be applied against and reduce the us holders basis in its class a ordinary shares but not below zero and to the extent in excess of such basis will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such class a ordinary shares with respect to noncorporate us holders under tax laws currently in effect dividends generally will be taxed at the lower applicable longterm capital gains rate see gain or loss on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a ordinary shares and warrants below only if our class a ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states and certain other requirements are met us holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of such lower rate for any dividends paid with respect to our class a ordinary shares gain or loss on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a ordinary shares and warrants subject to the pfic rules discussed below a us holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of our class a ordinary shares or warrants including on our dissolution and liquidation if we do not consummate an initial business combination within the required time period any such capital gain or loss generally will be longterm capital gain or loss if the us holders holding period for such class a ordinary shares or warrants exceeds one year it is unclear however whether certain redemption rights described in this prospectus may suspend the running of the applicable holding period of the class a ordinary shares for this purpose the amount of gain or loss recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition generally will be equal to the difference between i the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in such disposition or if the class a ordinary shares or warrants are held as part of units at the time of the disposition the portion of the amount realized on such disposition that is allocated to the class a ordinary shares or warrants based upon the then fair market values of the class a ordinary shares and the warrants constituting in the units and ii the us holders adjusted tax basis in its class a ordinary shares or warrants so disposed of a us holders adjusted tax basis in its class a ordinary shares generally will equal the us holders acquisition cost that is the portion of the purchase price of a unit allocated to a share of class a ordinary shares or onethird of one warrant as described above under  allocation of purchase price and characterization of a unit reduced by any prior distributions treated as a return of capital longterm capital gain realized by a noncorporate us holder may be taxed at reduced rates of taxation see exercise or lapse of a warrant below for a discussion regarding a us holders basis in the class a ordinary share acquired pursuant to the exercise of a warrant the deduction of capital losses is subject to certain limitations redemption of class a ordinary shares subject to the pfic rules discussed below in the event that a us holders class a ordinary shares are redeemed pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under description of securities  ordinary shares or if we purchase a us holders class a ordinary shares in an open market transaction the treatment of the transaction for united states federal income tax purposes will depend on whether the redemption or purchase by us qualifies as sale of the class a ordinary shares under section  of the code if the redemption or purchase by us qualifies as a sale of class a ordinary shares the us holder will be treated as described under gain or loss on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a ordinary shares and warrants above if the redemption or purchase by us does not qualify as a sale of class a ordinary shares the us holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences described above under taxation of distributions whether a redemption or purchase by us qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of our shares treated as held by the us holder including any shares constructively owned by the us holder as a result of owning warrants relative to all of our shares outstanding both before and after such redemption or purchase a redemption or purchase by us of class a ordinary shares generally will be treated as a sale of the class a ordinary shares rather than as a corporate distribution if such redemption or purchase i is substantially disproportionate with respect to the us holder ii results in a complete termination of the      table of contents us holders interest in us or iii is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to the us holder these tests are explained more fully below in determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied a us holder takes into account not only our shares actually owned by the us holder but also our shares that are constructively owned by it a us holder may constructively own in addition to shares owned directly shares owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the us holder has an interest or that have an interest in such us holder as well as any shares the us holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option which would generally include class a ordinary shares which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants in order to meet the substantially disproportionate test the percentage of our outstanding voting shares actually and constructively owned by the us holder immediately following the redemption or purchase of class a ordinary shares must among other requirements be less than  percent of the percentage of our outstanding voting shares actually and constructively owned by the us holder immediately before the redemption or purchase prior to our initial business combination the class a ordinary shares will not be voting shares for this purpose and consequently this substantially disproportionate test will not be applicable there will be a complete termination of a us holders interest if either i all of our shares actually and constructively owned by the us holder are redeemed or ii all of our shares actually owned by the us holder are redeemed and the us holder is eligible to waive and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules the attribution of shares owned by certain family members and the us holder does not constructively own any other shares of ours the redemption of the class a ordinary shares will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if a us holders conversion results in a meaningful reduction of the us holders proportionate interest in us whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a us holders proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances however the irs has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority shareholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a meaningful reduction a us holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a redemption or purchase by us if none of the foregoing tests are satisfied then the redemption or purchase by us will be treated as a corporate distribution and the tax effects will be as described under taxation of distributions above after the application of those rules any remaining tax basis of the us holder in the redeemed class a ordinary shares will be added to the us holders adjusted tax basis in its remaining shares or if it has none to the us holders adjusted tax basis in its warrants or possibly in other shares constructively owned by it exercise or lapse of a warrant subject to the pfic rules discussed below and except as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a warrant a us holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of a class a ordinary share on the exercise of a warrant for cash a us holders tax basis in a class a ordinary share received upon exercise of the warrant generally will equal the sum of the us holders initial investment in the warrant that is the portion of the us holders purchase price for the units that is allocated to the warrant as described above under allocation of purchase price and characterization of a unit and the exercise price it is unclear whether a us holders holding period for the class a ordinary share received will commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant in either case the holding period will not include the period during which the us holder held the warrant if a warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised a us holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holders tax basis in the warrant the tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current law a cashless exercise may not be taxable either because the exercise is not a realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for united states federal income tax purposes in either situation a us holders tax basis in the class a ordinary shares received generally will equal the us holders tax basis in the warrants if the cashless exercise was not a realization event it is unclear whether a us holders holding period for the class a ordinary share received will commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant if the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization the holding period of the class a ordinary shares received would include the holding period of the warrants      table of contents it is also possible that a cashless exercise may be treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized in such event a us holder may be deemed to have surrendered warrants with an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise price for the total number of warrants to be exercised the us holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the warrants deemed surrendered and the us holders tax basis in such warrants in this case a us holders tax basis in the class a ordinary shares received would equal the sum of the us holders initial investment in the warrants exercised ie the portion of the us holders purchase price for the units that is allocated to the warrant as described above under allocation of purchase price and characterization of a unit and the exercise price of such warrants it is unclear whether a us holders holding period for the class a ordinary share received would commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant due to the absence of authority on the united states federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise including when a us holders holding period would commence with respect to the class a ordinary share received there can be no assurance which if any of the alternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the irs or a court of law accordingly us holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise possible constructive distributions the terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of class a ordinary shares for which the warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the warrant in certain events as discussed in the section of this prospectus captioned description of securities  warrants  public shareholders warrants an adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable the us holders of the warrants would however be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if for example the adjustment increases such us holders proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits eg through an increase in the number of class a ordinary shares that would be obtained upon exercise as a result of a distribution of cash to the holders of our class a ordinary shares such constructive distribution to a us holder of warrants would be treated as if such us holder had received a cash distribution from us generally equal to the fair market value of such increased interest taxed as described above under taxation of distributions for certain information reporting purposes we are required to determine the date and amount of any such constructive distributions recently proposed treasury regulations which we may rely on prior to the issuance of final regulations specify how the date and amount of constructive distributions are determined passive foreign investment company rules a foreign ie nonus corporation will be classified as a pfic for united states federal income tax purposes if either i at least  of its gross income in a taxable year including its pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least  of the shares by value is passive income or ii at least  of its assets in a taxable year ordinarily determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year including its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least  of the shares by value are held for the production of or produce passive income passive income generally includes dividends interest rents and royalties other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business and gains from the disposition of passive assets because we are a blank check company with no current active business we believe that it is likely that we will meet the pfic asset or income test for our current taxable year ending december   however pursuant to a startup exception a corporation will not be a pfic for the first taxable year the corporation has gross income if   no predecessor of the corporation was a pfic  the corporation satisfies the irs that it will not be a pfic for either of the first two taxable years following the startup year and  the corporation is not in fact a pfic for either of those years the applicability of the startup exception to us will not be known until after the close of our current taxable year ending december   after the acquisition of a company or assets in a business combination we may still meet one of the pfic tests depending on the timing of the acquisition and the amount of our passive income and assets as well as the passive income and assets of the acquired business if the company that we acquire in a business combination is a pfic then we will likely not qualify for the startup exception and will be a pfic for our current taxable year ending      table of contents december   our actual pfic status for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year however will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year accordingly there can be no assurance with respect to our status as a pfic for our current taxable year ending december   or any future taxable year although our pfic status is determined annually an initial determination that our company is a pfic will generally apply for subsequent years to a us holder who held class a ordinary shares or warrants while we were a pfic whether or not we meet the test for pfic status in those subsequent years if we are determined to be a pfic for any taxable year or portion thereof that is included in the holding period of a us holder of our class a ordinary shares or warrants and in the case of our class a ordinary shares the us holder did not make either a timely qualified electing fund qef election for our first taxable year as a pfic in which the us holder held or was deemed to hold class a ordinary shares as described below such us holder generally will be subject to special rules with respect to i any gain recognized by the us holder on the sale or other disposition of its class a ordinary shares or warrants and ii any excess distribution made to the us holder generally any distributions to such us holder during a taxable year of the us holder that are greater than  of the average annual distributions received by such us holder in respect of the class a ordinary shares during the three preceding taxable years of such us holder or if shorter such us holders holding period for the class a ordinary shares under these rules  the us holders gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the us holders holding period for the class a ordinary shares or warrants  the amount allocated to the us holders taxable year in which the us holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution or to the period in the us holders holding period before the first day of our first taxable year in which we are a pfic will be taxed as ordinary income  the amount allocated to other taxable years or portions thereof of the us holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the us holder and  an additional tax equal to the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the us holder with respect to the tax attributable to each such other taxable year of the us holder in general if we are determined to be a pfic a us holder will avoid the pfic tax consequences described above in respect to our class a ordinary shares by making a timely and valid qef election to include in income its pro rata share of our net capital gains as longterm capital gain and other earnings and profits as ordinary income on a current basis in each case whether or not distributed in the taxable year of the us holder in which or with which our taxable year ends a us holder generally may make a separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the qef rules but if deferred any such taxes will be subject to an interest charge a us holder may not make a qef election with respect to its warrants to acquire our class a ordinary shares as a result if a us holder sells or otherwise disposes of such warrants other than upon exercise of such warrants and we were a pfic at any time during the us holders holding period of such warrants any gain recognized generally will be treated as an excess distribution taxed as described above if a us holder that exercises such warrants properly makes a qef election with respect to the newly acquired class a ordinary shares or has previously made a qef election with respect to our class a ordinary shares the qef election will apply to the newly acquired class a ordinary shares notwithstanding any such qef election the adverse tax consequences relating to pfic shares adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the qef election will continue to apply with respect to such newly acquired class a ordinary shares which generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the pfic rules that includes the period the us holder held the warrants unless the us holder makes a purging election under the pfic rules under the purging election the us holder will be deemed to have sold such shares at their fair market value and any gain recognized on such deemed sale will be treated as an      table of contents excess distribution as described above as a result of the purging election the us holder will have a new basis and holding period in the class a ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise of the warrants for purposes of the pfic rules the qef election is made on a shareholderbyshareholder basis and once made can be revoked only with the consent of the irs a us holder generally makes a qef election by attaching a completed irs form  information return by a shareholder of a passive foreign investment company or qualified electing fund including the information provided in a pfic annual information statement to a timely filed united states federal income tax return for the tax year to which the election relates retroactive qef elections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if certain other conditions are met or with the consent of the irs us holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a retroactive qef election under their particular circumstances in order to comply with the requirements of a qef election a us holder must receive a pfic annual information statement from us if we determine we are a pfic for any taxable year we will endeavor to provide to a us holder such information as the irs may require including a pfic annual information statement in order to enable the us holder to make and maintain a qef election but there is no assurance that we will timely provide such required information there is also no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of our status as a pfic in the future or of the required information to be provided if a us holder has made a qef election with respect to our class a ordinary shares and the excess distribution rules discussed above do not apply to such shares because of a timely qef election for our first taxable year as a pfic in which the us holder holds or is deemed to hold such shares or a purge of the pfic taint pursuant to a purging election as described above any gain recognized on the sale of our class a ordinary shares generally will be taxable as capital gain and no additional tax charge will be imposed under the pfic rules as discussed above if we are a pfic for any taxable year a us holder of our class a ordinary shares that has made a qef election will be currently taxed on its pro rata share of our earnings and profits whether or not distributed for such year a subsequent distribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable when distributed to such us holder the tax basis of a us holders shares in a qef will be increased by amounts that are included in income and decreased by amounts distributed but not taxed as dividends under the above rules in addition if we are not a pfic for any taxable year such us holder will not be subject to the qef inclusion regime with respect to our class a ordinary shares for such a taxable year if we are a pfic and our class a ordinary shares constitute marketable stock a us holder may avoid the adverse pfic tax consequences discussed above if such us holder at the close of the first taxable year in which it holds or is deemed to hold our class a ordinary shares makes a marktomarket election with respect to such shares for such taxable year such us holder generally will include for each of its taxable years as ordinary income the excess if any of the fair market value of its class a ordinary shares at the end of such year over its adjusted basis in its class a ordinary shares the us holder also will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of the excess if any of its adjusted basis of its class a ordinary shares over the fair market value of its class a ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the marktomarket election the us holders basis in its class a ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts and any further gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of its class a ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary income currently a marktomarket election may not be made with respect to warrants the marktomarket election is available only for marketable stock generally stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the securities and exchange commission including nasdaq capital market on which we intend to list the class a ordinary shares or on a foreign exchange or market that the irs determines has rules sufficient to ensure that the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a marktomarket election in respect to our class a ordinary shares under their particular circumstances      table of contents if we are a pfic and at any time have a foreign subsidiary that is classified as a pfic us holders generally would be deemed to own a portion of the shares of such lowertier pfic and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if we receive a distribution from or dispose of all or part of our interest in the lowertier pfic or the us holders otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an interest in the lowertier pfic we will endeavor to cause any lowertier pfic to provide to a us holder the information that may be required to make or maintain a qef election with respect to the lowertier pfic there can be no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of the status of any such lowertier pfic in addition we may not hold a controlling interest in any such lowertier pfic and thus there can be no assurance we will be able to cause the lowertier pfic to provide such required information us holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax issues raised by lowertier pfics a us holder that owns or is deemed to own shares in a pfic during any taxable year of the us holder may have to file an irs form  whether or not a qef or markettomarket election is made and such other information as may be required by the us treasury department failure to do so if required will extend the statute of limitations until such required information is furnished to the irs the rules dealing with pfics and with the qef and marktomarket elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described above accordingly us holders of our class a ordinary shares and warrants should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the pfic rules to our securities under their particular circumstances tax reporting certain us holders may be required to file an irs form  return by a us transferor of property to a foreign corporation to report a transfer of property including cash to us substantial penalties may be imposed on a us holder that fails to comply with this reporting requirement furthermore certain us holders who are individuals and certain entities will be required to report information with respect to such us holders investment in specified foreign financial assets on irs form  statement of specified foreign financial assets subject to certain exceptions an interest in the company constitutes a specified foreign financial asset for these purposes persons who are required to report specified foreign financial assets and fail to do so may be subject to substantial penalties potential investors are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the foreign financial asset and other reporting obligations and their application to an investment in our class a ordinary shares and warrants nonus holders this section applies to you if you are a nonus

income tax at the same regular united states federal income tax rates applicable to a comparable us holder and in the case of a nonus holder that is a corporation for united states federal income tax purposes also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a  rate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate the united states federal income tax treatment of a nonus holders exercise of a warrant or the lapse of a warrant held by a nonus holder generally will correspond to the united states federal income tax treatment of the exercise or lapse of a warrant by a us holder as described under us holders   exercise or lapse of a warrant above although to the extent a cashless exercise results in a taxable exchange the consequences would be similar to those described in the preceding paragraphs above for a nonus holders gain on the sale or other disposition of our class a ordinary shares and warrants information reporting and backup withholding dividend payments with respect to our class a ordinary shares and proceeds from the sale exchange or redemption of our class a ordinary shares may be subject to information reporting to the irs and possible united states

from backup withholding and establishes such exempt status a nonus holder generally will eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by providing certification of its foreign status under penalties of perjury on a duly executed applicable irs form w or by otherwise establishing an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a us holders us federal income tax liability and a holder generally may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely

respect to permitted transferees as described herein under principal shareholders  transfers of founder shares and private placement warrants prior to this offering there has been no public market for our securities consequently the initial public offering price for the units was determined by negotiations between us and the representative the determination of our per unit offering price was more arbitrary than would typically be the case if we were an operating company among the factors considered in determining initial public offering price were the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies prior offerings of those companies our management our capital structure and currently prevailing general conditions in equity securities markets including current market valuations of publicly traded companies considered comparable to our company we cannot assure you however that the price at which the units class a ordinary shares or

purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the
