technology — aspyrian therapeutics inc photoimmunotherapy a new precision targeted approach to treat cancerphotoimmunotherapy is based on a new drug system that consist of a cancer targeting monoclonal antibody conjugated to a photoactivatable molecule this drug conjugate is not pharmacologically active until the conjugate is bound to the cancer cells and gains anticancer activity upon lightmediated activation at the tumor site tumor targeting and context precision activation of the drug provides exquisite cancer specificity and permits rapid cancer cell killing without damage to
