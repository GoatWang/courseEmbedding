smart about nodal microwave at a time in the notsodistant past there was only one way to implement microwave radio one radio link per microwave terminal did not matter what type of link it concerned protected nonprotected or multichannel from the advent of digital microwave radio in the s and s terminals typically had no options for integration of colocated telecom devices and to interconnect muxes or switches required external cabling and possibly a patchpanel then in the early s socalled “nodal” radios came into vogue designed to address the drawbacks of the oneradioonelink paradigm a single microwave radio node could serve as a platform for multiple links there were still limitations when it came to radio and switch interactions but multiple sources of traffic could now be integrated and connected on the nodal platform read more june   no comments yet we put the spotlight on voice over lte volte as one of the most anticipated network technologies voice over lte volte has been discussed by operators for years the expectation was that deployments would start in  but rollouts in north america were delayed logo courtesy of ytd blog operators have faced a series of issues that include poor voice quality and long call establishment times once these problems are solved it is expected that volte will allow operators to provide  voice and data services using an integrated packet network as the problems described show the implementation of volte presents challenges for the entire lte ecosystem including microwave backhaul we have produced a white paper to describe some of the volte requirements that must be met in order to overcome these technical challenges which must encompass a flexible microwave backhaul as a key factor for a successful transition

to transition to layer  ip services photo credit zdenadel  foter  cc bynd the entire wireless industry is on the cusp of a transitive time where layer  ip services will be needed in the access portion of the network and the backhaul will be needed to provide them under the pain of restating the obvious we have all seen the explosive growth of smartphones tablet computers and other radiofrequencyloving gadgets like ereaders all these newfangled hightech contraptions need layer  ipmpls services in the access and backhaul in order to deliver a satisfying seamless user experience—especially for enterprise services the question is how will the mobile network operators mnos be able to deliver these services from their thousands or tens of thousands of cell sites typically the answer would involve deploying a regular router for ip services at each and every cell site but have you seen the prices of routers lately cisco didn’t get to where it is today without having some heavy pricetags attached to all the heavy iron it’s shipped over the last odd years suffice to say it would be a pretty penny if mnos equipped all their cell sites with their own dedicated routers so what else can be done you query it just so happens that aviat networks’ director of corporate marketing gary croke has posted an article at rcr wireless going over what to do in these types of situations but we’ll give you a hint the ip router function should be folded into a single multiservice multilayer cell site device read the rest and let us know what you think related articles

fotercom  cc by a quick googleglance around the internet will reveal a panoply of alloutdoor radios odrs in both microwave and millimeterwave bands odrs do not conform to a universal norm in terms of networking features power consumption bandwidth scalability ie capacity or outright radio horsepower ie system gain so if you find yourself asking the questions “which odr is the best fit for my network” or “how do i narrow the odr field” it is good to start with the basics the right product choice can be quickly resolved—or at least the candidates can be shortlisted—by focusing on three odr product attributes that most heavily influence the valueforthemoney ie total cost of ownership or tco equation packet throughput capacity which dictates the usable life of the odr power consumption which affects the energy bill rf performance which impacts antenna size—more system gain equates to smaller antennas for many microwave backhaul networks the growth in underlying traffic is such that products which cannot scale to  mbps gbps per channel will run out of momentum too early and precipitate the dreaded “forklift upgrade” also known as the “cfo’s nightmare” these same cfos are also suffering sleepless nights due to rising energy costs—which in some countries can double yearoveryear therefore it behooves the operator to seek and prioritize the use of über energyefficient products such as the aviat wtm  which—and this is important—do not compromise on rf performance that brings me to my last point system gain rf performance remains a core tco factor insofar as it can drive smaller antenna usage with the concomitant capex savings still there might be little to differentiate odrs in terms of rf performance—in which case the spotlight will fall on these other attributes to sway the decision having worked on the operator side and wrestled with tco analysis on many occasions my experience tells me that you can narrow your odr choice quickly by reflecting on these three attributes and the tco gains they can deliver jarlath lally product marketing manager aviat networks related articles alloutdoor microwave radios site considerations aviatnetworkscom commscope

concentrated in europe g and the usa lte g small cells may also be deployed in other regions as a means to avoid the difficulties in obtaining planning approval for larger macrocell sites it’s still early today as far as wireless small cell backhaul scbh solutions are concerned there is evidence of product immaturity and hyperactivity in equal measure there is profusion of aggressively hyped solutions including many that are a rehashing existingniche solutions and at the opposite extreme some very new and unproven technologies in practice these solutions are jockeying for position while

consumed vast quantities of power and space at equal rates they were complex “animals” that took days to install and hours to configure then they had to be looked after like wellloved but aged members of the family—with care all due respect and consideration over time components went out of adjustment and had to be brought back into line through various tuning routines but overall they did their job as the superreliable backbone of the pots ie plain old telephone service jump forward a few decades and the latest trunking microwave solutions are elegant and graceful—almost svelte with their current high levels of electronic integration a complete repeater system can stand in a single rack space—unheard of until the most recent products furthermore these new systems consume dramatically less power—a typical  system ie four transceivers consumes less than  watts so now backbone operators can save significantly on operating expenditure because of decreased space and power requirements at their microwave radio shelters evolving microwave systems from analog to digital microwave systems carrying digital payloads was a rocky and dangerous path the next migration from tdm payloads to ip payloads appears to be just as treacherous how can a traditional tdm backbone radio typically configured with n radio protection switching be reconfigured to transport a nontdm payload that does not suit n switching ip transport is a completely different environment altogether luckily trunking radio system designers have not ignored the internet revolution and are perfectly aware of these challenges in fact wellappointed trunking microwave radio systems allow a graceful evolution from tdm to ip with capability to transport both types of traffic simultaneously—and with their own ultrareliable protection schemes today trunking microwave radios can support both tdm and ip seamlessly offer robust radio performance and highly reliable switching and really do make it easy for operators to design missioncritical backbone networks they offer mean time between failure mtbf reliability figures into the hundredsofyears and highly integrated yet modular designs which make expansion very straightforward before deciding on a trunking microwave radio consider if the system allows easy migration from tdm to ip with a minimal amount of replacement materials can expand to an expected maximum channel capacity for example six channels without needing additional racks etc enables repeater configurations within one rack has a fieldproven heritage of reliability and

aviat microwave radios can help solve the complexity and scalability problems of carrier ethernet technology carrier ethernet ce transport networks are growing in both scale and complexity requiring both vendors and operators to deliver solutions to sustain their growth to help address this aviat networks recently participated in the european advanced networking testing center’s eantc annual multivendor interoperability testing event to validate several aspects of scaling ce networks among other things increasing ce network sizes increase the complexity of management—especially from a services perspective—when ce services span multiple network domains the ability to partition management domains and effectively manage alarms that accurately identify and propagate notification of network faults dramatically speeds up the fault isolation and resolution process across large networks utilizing and effectively implementing “hierarchical service oam” in growing ce networks is valuable to overcoming this challenge and was a key area of the recent interoperability testing another critical aspect of growth is dealing with multitechnology—not just multivendor—interoperability as ce networks scale there is an increasing mix of ethernet switching mpls and most recently mplstp internetworking emerging one potentially complex area that was also tested was validating the operation and survivability of intersecting ethernet and mplstp rings in a multihomed topology the “erpsv and vpls interworking” test validated that standardsbased g ethernet protected rings and mplstp vpls rings can interoperate or more significantly “cooperate” to allow complex multitechnology networks to deliver reliable endtoend services to learn about these aspects of scaling and dealing

best backhaul solution for north american operators aviat networks’ packet node iru is an example of an allindoor microwave radio which is one choice wireless operators should consider for implementations in north america there’s a lot of buzz in the microwave industry about the trend toward alloutdoor radios but those who haven’t been through lte deployments may be surprised to learn that based on our experience deploying lte backhaul for some of the world’s largest lte networks allindoor is actually the best radio architecture for lte backhaul we can debate today’s lte backhaul capacity requirements but one thing we do know is that with new advances in lte technology the capacity needed is going to grow this means that microwave radios installed for backhaul will likely have to be upgraded with more capacity over time although people are experimenting with compression techniques and very high qam modulations and other capacity extension solutions the most proven way to expand capacity is to add radio channels because it represents real usable bandwidth independent of packet sizes traffic mix and the rf propagation environment allindoor radios are more expensive initially in terms of capital expenditures but they’re cheaper to expand and as electronics are accessible without tower climb are more easily serviced while an outdoor radio connects to the antenna with ethernet or coax cable indoor radios usually need a more expensive waveguide to carry the rf signal from the radio to the antenna so you pay more up front with an allindoor radio but as the radio’s capacity grows you save money there are several reasons when everything related to the radio is indoors you just have a waveguide and an antenna up on the tower to add radio channels with an allindoor radio you go into the cabinet and add an rf unit with an outdoor radio you have to climb the tower which can cost as much as  also when you add a new outdoor rf unit you may have to swap out the antenna for a larger one due to extra losses incurred by having to combine radio channels on tower…read the full story at rcr wireless gary croke senior product marketing manager aviat networks

   comments  ways to get smart about nodal microwave at a time in the notsodistant past there was only one way to implement microwave radio one radio link per microwave terminal did not matter what type of link it concerned protected nonprotected or multichannel from the advent of digital microwave radio in the s and s terminals typically had no options for integration of colocated telecom devices and to interconnect muxes or switches required external cabling and possibly a patchpanel then in the early s socalled “nodal” radios came into vogue designed to address the drawbacks of the oneradioonelink paradigm a single microwave radio node could serve as a platform for multiple links there were still limitations when it came to radio and switch interactions but multiple sources of traffic could now be integrated and connected on the nodal platform read more june   no comments yet up to the challenge mobile operators look for new business the mobile phone industry has been mature for some time around the world most people who want and are able to use a cellular handset already have one—sometimes more than one even with innovations such as hspa lte and ltea becoming

service a series of analog microwave radio hops for the canadian province of nova scotia’s department of natural resources the radios in question were the ss model the province used them to carry government data traffic for firefighters and police where data bits were stuffed into khz voice channels remarkably  years later three hops of these ss radios are still in operation making these quite possibly the world’s oldest continuously inservice microwave links farinon ss analog microwave radio transmitters but not entire units were available for sale on ebay as recently as  how’s that for longevity offering   or  voice channels on the old ghz band ss radios were considered cuttingedge technology at the time—check out their cool retrostyle data sheet—and highly reliable with their ability to provide microwave links despite the challenging weather and difficult propagation conditions of nova scotia—snow ice sleet fog…they have it all as proof four other ss radio hops were recently decommissioned and found to still be working up to spec as per the original accepted level of performance then there was someone selling ss radios on ebay in  but we challenge you our loyal

latency microwave network then you are not alone microwave is quickly becoming the default transport choice for low latency networks however building an ultralow latency microwave network is not simple there are many considerations latency through the “box” is important but it is not the only factor and too much focus on this metric may be a distraction what is most important is endtoend latency of the link aviat networks recently addressed this topic in a webinar registration required and free presentation download and answered three very important questions regarding ultralow latency microwave technology also in this webinar travis mitchell aviat networks director of low latency business development and sergio licardie aviat networks senior director of systems engineering consider the best practices for ultralow latency microwave networks as they explore the techniques technologies and design approaches necessary to ensure lowest endtoend latency they also discuss some innovations to look for in microwave networking to ensure continuous improvement in endtoend latency performance other topics covered include main contributors to endtoend latency of microwave
