nowmain navigationuno premier review – should you join or stay away january   by jesse singh  comments a new network marketing company has launched and it’s stirring up a lot of hype and buzz  i decided to find out what this company is all about and make sure it’s legit… in this uno premier review i am going to go through the company product line and compensation plan so you can make an accurate decision to join it or not… pay attention and read this all the way through to avoid disappointment… uno premier review – the company website  httpwwwunopremiercom even though the company launched in october of  the company claims that their main company “uno” or mother company started  years ago in the philippines… the company is the brain child of a man named william barbo who is the president and has been in the network marketing industry for  years and counting i did a back ground check on william barbo but i couldn’t find anything prior to uno premier… hmmm…that’s interesting the website also states something interesting… they apparently created over  philippine millionaires in the span of  years and have over  offices spread through out the nation again i can’t find anything on that to make sure these claims are true… next let’s take a look at the product line… the uno premier review – the product line the company far as i know has three products listed on their website… pro cardio – “improves your hdl ldl triglycerides and much much more” sante  berries – a “one stop all” supplement that covers all your nutritional needs… apparently nutrifab – a weight loss product that detoxes at the same time… so you can lose weight and go to the bathroom at the same time lol i tried searching for the prices but nothing came up  all i saw was this… the only way to buy the product is if you buy the packages that rank from  to  and it varies in different countries for example for the philippines the price is  to  a little steep if you ask me other countries uno premier packages are sold in include nigeria pakistan singapore hong king and dubai i did notice that these packages have more than the “three” they have on their website but they are not branded “uno premier” for some reason… keep reading the products bundled in these package include juice coffee kryptorganic i don’t think superman will like this vitalife  possible vitamin supplement choco  chocolate drink it seems like magic cream that’s the actual name i wonder if it has magic grapeseed fitright and many many more… from what it looks like uno premier isn’t the actual manufacture of these product or even the brand  they seem to be selling thirdparty health and wellness products let’s check out the business opportunity… uno premier reviews – the business like all mlm companies out there you get a commission for enrolling someone that buys one of those product packages i listed before… instead of me trying to explain the compensation plan… …watch this short video all the way through note  i do not endorse this video it’s for education purposes only the compensation plan is profitable for the right people… the keyword there is “right” people the cost to join depends on which package you purchase platinum –  premier –  premier elite –  global premier –  uno premier scam – does it really exist overall i don’t see this company as a scam… but the only thing i am concerned about is the lack of information about the previous company and the president… i personally wouldn’t join this company just yet and wait it out until they get a little more established and maybe sell their “own” products and not a third party brand… i am sorry to disappoint you if you were excited about this company and were ready to join but i am just sick and tired of people getting scammed there are thousands of other network marketing companies that are much more established that you can join and feel confident they won’t be going anywhere… of all the companies i have reviewed… this is my  recommendation click here the reason for it is simple… the biggest problem people have when they join a business is sponsoring people… if you can’t sponsor people you won’t make any money some people might say “you can sell the products” well you can but can you make a full time income from minimum profits i don’t think so… this is the only opportunity i ever seen that doesn’t require recruiting and you can make a fortune if you take action and can follow simple instructions click here to see what i mean i am just looking out for you… i hope you enjoyed my uno premier review and if you are in the company please comment below about your personal experience about the products and the company in general… until next time also follow me on social media below i am a real person  follow me on facebook here subscribe to my youtube channel here follow me on twitter here follow me on instagram here god bless you all jesse singh ps  stop failing and start profiting  click here to find out how hcshort id”″ reader interactionscomments joannie says may   at  am are you sure about the number of branches uno has you said that you could not find evidence on the  branches… why don’t you search harder reply jesse singh says may   at  pm joannie time of the review i had an insider source tell me reply mer says may   at  pm hi jesse i have been a member of uno since  when i was still a call center agent in cebu city our products range from beauty and health products i have been doing uno now for  straight years and i have been to several countries including usa uae and japan for trip incentives by the company and that  millionaires  of that is coming from my team 🙂 i too have a blog but i dont spend even a dime of my time reviewing under companies i would rather invest that on a course learn and teach it to my team anyway you have a great day and wish you the best in your mlm profession mer reply jesse singh says may   at  pm hey mer i see you don’t spend time on your blog and would rather invest it on courses… mer my blogs get me over  leads per day and i sign up on an average of  people all online… soooo… why isn’t that worth the investment lol reply axel says july   at  pm how much were you paid for this comment  or are you a relative of your boss uno is  huge scam to make mangers rich but the people who work hard to sell there products not only do they get such small percentage they are asked to pay for privilege uno takes advantage of the poor makes them believe they can get dream cars but actually they just abuse their employees wake up reply jj says march   at  pm hi axel i believe that you have not yet understood the system of network marketing network marketing is for everyone but not everyone is for network marketing raine says march   at  pm you know what axel youre a close minded cheap motherfther that opens his mouth and doesnt open his  ears to listen probably you tried uno but you didnt study to better didnt use the tools and did the wrong moves to grow in mlm you should be the one telling it to yourself wake up coz if you die poor its just because of your own rot rainecanada ivy says june   at  pm thanks for the tips…very helpful… reply jesse singh says june   at  pm hey ivy no problem anytime 🙂 reply g man says july   at  am uno is just starting out here in the us my friend sponsored me and my wife to join we agreed since the business seem to make sense despite the unpopular reputation of multilevel networking the big draw is actually the prices of the products affordable and competitive then our package came first week of june with a new price list prices of all the items increased by more than  example their  in  coffee was from  a box to  distributor price to be sold at  a box of juice to be sold at  who would in their right mind buy an overpriced unknown product that came from the philippines a sudden jump in the prices without even the top earners here in the us knowing about it is very suspicious i am from california my wife and motherinlaw also just joined this june waiting for a reply from the president or whoever is incharge until this issue is resolved i’m treating it as a scam if the prices are confirmed to stay as is then i would request for a refund reply may says july   at  am i think your too late for a refund…you have to face it think of it as a charity or donation scam for sure  reply g man says july   at  am i’m not convinced quite yet it remains to be seen i have word that my refund is on it’s way i am hoping this company is honorable enough to fulfill it’s word if they do then i would retract my previous statement for it being a scam i’ll keep everybody posted reply g man says july   at  pm i’m thankful that i finally received my refund uno may not be a scam after all but the damage has been done it could have been a good business venture since they have a system that pretty much makes sense but with the recent undisclosed price hike i would rather think twice i still have my doubts about multilevel networking systems but these types of decisions has made the stigma even worse i will not be joining in one anytime soon reply george emmanuel says july   at  pm jessei ve gone through ur review of unoit’s really an interesting informative piece you said you don’t consider it a scamtherefore i think it is worth tryingthe price hike is truly an aspect to worry aboutthanks all the same george reply jonalyn myr ramos says august   at  am i don’t like the way they convince people they convince you as long and any way they can and even they are lying just to make you sign up reply jesse singh says august   at  pm hey yeah i agree i don’t like it when people approach me and try to sell me their deal that’s why i am apart of a program that doesn’t require recruiting 🙂 reply y says december   at  pm jesseyou created this blog to destroy other and promote your business dirty marketing strategy reply jesse singh says december   at  pm actually no i haven’t i just reveal the truth and i personally could have joined a million things myself but i only start businesses that give real value and help people succeed so get off your high horse and stop being so negative reply john de leon says september   at  pm jesse just because you think your’e right doesn’t mean your’e right its not a scam until its a scam its a budding mlm with actually good products especially the supplements for people over  years old i am a skeptic too i joined uno premier usa last july here in southern california and i have already earned more than i have invested last august  a  investment is good enough for me so far so good btw i own a small business to boot which means i’m not even trying that hard to earn from uno i just attend their webinars online and attend as much presentations they have here in california to educate myself more on how i can help people set up their own small business with uno i actually went to their main office here in long beach ca to see if there is really an office before i joined you can’t have an instant gratification when it comes to business ventures it takes feasibility study time study motivation selfstudy planning forecasting of goals patience and most of all humility and integrity to succeed in whatever business you invest in and last if it doesn’t work for me along the line that’s just fine with me because i already got more than my money’s worth no risk no progress reply jesse singh says september   at  pm hey john no where in my blog i called it a scam and all i said was wait until the company is more established so why are you getting all emotional here reply erik says june   at  am anyone can put up a business and rent an office space and close it once it’s done a  year business can’t justify “stability” others say they left their jobs but i know one who joined but keep her job assurance yeah fall back yeah why would you leave your salaried job for a not stable business id rather have starbucks for  than  from unbranded coffee reply lampi says september   at  pm my kiss keep it simple stupid question is why do i need to pay to join and sell the product example to be a premier member i have to pay  to sell per presentation half of the   you paid will be used to purchase the products ok good what about the other half  – where is this going ok say you used part of it to pay for the  and certificate for the other guy before you do the math on the other half of the  you paid since half was used to purchase the product and see who gets the lion share of the money you paid reply a says september   at  pm i’m thinking to join the company but i need some advice coz i been joining mlm but nothing going on its so hard to convince people to join reply jesse singh says september   at  pm well sadly you have to convince people in uno… i personally don’t do uno and do a different business model that doesn’t require recruiting if you would like more info on that let me know reply oliver says october   at  am hello jesse i’m interested to know about your business model hoping for your reply many thanks oliver reply jesse singh says october   at  pm hey oliver i will add you to my mailing list reply dr rizwan says april   at  am can you add me please jesse singh says april   at  pm hey yes of course mandy says june   at  pm would like to know too trying to make a decision also thanks in anticipation jesse singh says june   at  pm hey mandy i will add you to my list 🙂 sade says august   at  pm please add me to your mailing list too jesse singh says august   at  pm hey yes of course peter says september   at  pm jesse singh get me hook up to your own idea reply jesse singh says september   at  pm hey peter i will add you to my list reply rachael says october   at  pm please can you add me to your mailing list also jesse singh says october   at  pm you got it markus says september   at  am all mlm benefits only a few the majority say  will destined to loss because this is inherent to the system and you can’t do about it the best thing for you to do is work your way up to the top working your way up to the the top takes a lot of effort patience time and even deception i’m a member of uno international corporation – philippines because my friend invited me in she already spent a lot of time and resources just trying to get me in so i joined with no intention of doing business but for me to avail of the  distributor discount as im frequently buying their products for personal use the payin i made that time was php  that was a dead money for me so i care less about the returns i got php worth of products in return the remaining php go to some other costs which i think actually cost around php the remaining php will be shared by my friend who referred me and also to the persons on the top of the pyramid products of mlm companies are usually overprice for end users but you can offset it up by being a distributor because of the distributor discount this means that you will find it hard very hard to market the products which in return your main income will be from the payins of the prospective distributors and this is the fault of the system why only few will actually benefit but some find it an opportunity if they have already a lot of prospective recruitsinvites so the key is invite and invite and invite more persons look at this illustration say if i paid php for a product worth only php meaning i have a lost of php i can recover my lost of p by having successful invites of two persons because i can have a referral fee from them but inorder for you to gain reasonable amounts you should have atleast  successful invites with this you already recover your entire php then the burden of recovering cost is pass on to your downlines if you want a real stable business you will fail because of overprice products which is very hard to market and much of your profit will come from future successful invites later on distributors will find it difficult to direct sale and will dropout leaving you none to earn commission and you will force to recruit again to replace the dropouts this is also the reason of their very aggressive recruiting activities no new recruits means dead uno reply sam says october   at  am thank you so much for your explanation  i’m surely not join it  reply ivy baltazar says september   at  am hi jesse kindly give some info with regards to your business model that doesn’t need recruiting i joined so many mlm coz i don’t want to say no to my friends who recruited me but i warned them i will not recruit hehehe i don’t join mlm wo products at least if it have products even though it’s scam or not popular or whatever you get something out from the money you invested not totally lose it ivy reply jesse singh says september   at  pm hey ivy i will add you to my mailing list look out for “jesse singh – you’re all set” jesse reply stephanie says may   at  pm please kindly add me to your mailing list will like to know about your business too reply jesse singh says may   at  pm hey you got it reply evita says june   at  pm hey jesse i will like to know abtabt your business tooplease mail me jesse singh says june   at  pm hey evita you got it teejay says june   at  pm i will be greatful jesse if u can add me to your mailing list of a  where you don’t have to recruit peoplethanks reply jesse singh says june   at  am hey you got it reply douglas says july   at  am me too reply ces says october   at  am hi jesse one of my friend invites me to joined uno here in dubai it was accidentally joined the uno sept  and the forced me to joined they gave me the registration form that they even not giving me a chance to read then i signed i gave my id  my credit card suddenly my debit card declined but i have money the cashier swipe twice still declined they were suppose to debit  dirhams i dont know why always declined then my credit card from other bank they swipe  dirhams so the transaction was succesful i informed my boyfriend that i joined uno then he was mad he explained everything to me regarding networking or marketing so my mind was confused then suddenly i told to myself he’s right now i spoke to my friend that i will not continue anymore the uno and they will returm my money  dirhams and she said you cannot get anymore your money how come i said you never give the products and she said you have already account is there a possible i cant take my money back  dirhams reply jesse singh says october   at  pm hey ces if the products haven’t been sent you should get a refund if not do a chargeback on the card reply anon says december   at  pm you should take a look at some of their newer products it gets crazier and crazier… i saw them selling a pendant “that improves health”… and people were actually inquiring about it… poor saps ironically i personally know the family of its founder… we went to highschool together… they’re really nice people… didn’t know they were conartists tho’ reply maridean g says january   at  am hi jesse pls give me some info regarding ur business modeli have a friend who kep bugging me and my husband to join uno and i think their sign up fee is too high and hard to convince people nowadays…im a full time mom and looking for a business venture without recruiting people since most of the time i stay home to attend to my familythank you and more power reply aria says january   at  am i’m broke really broke i’m afraid of not being able to finish college because my parents are close to retiring someone is recruiting me in uno here in the philippines i’m not that smart so i fell for the sales talk i knew it was too good to be true but i thought “hey lots of people from my school are in it how can it be so bad” so i paid a down payment by selling my unused tablet i haven’t paid the full registration fee yet but i want this to be not a scam so badly because i want to finish college i want to help my parents i don’t know what to do i confronted them about it i’m waiting for a reply now… reply jesse singh says january   at  pm hey sorry to hear that when starting any business make sure you have a job that generates some capital so you can support that business… reply benjun says january   at  pm hi jesse i guess you have to come over to the philippines so you can check whether it’s a scam or not the more than  offices in the philippines is not a myth because i have already gone to more than  offices in the philippines to check if it really exist i called up some of my friends in different parts of the region and they attest that there is really an office in their aresi have known the owner mr william barbo for more than  years now and this guy has full of dreams and plans to make uno premier to be the number  network marketing company in the world he is a very energetic guy who rides his mountain bike everyday together with some of the members of uno and at pm he makes sure that he goes straight to the uno office and work i know this because he is my direct and i am a part of his team the wbm millionaires team as a satisfied uno premier member i suggest that you guys stop doubting about the company and instead work it out so you can see if it’s scam or not for me when i started uno premier i was really broke with only  savings in my bank and got a package worth  and because i was so desperate to earn i really work hard and got more than  globals and  elite premier and  platinum in  weeks after a week i got my check at the head office in ortigas in mandaluyong and in just  days i was able to earn  no doubt it’s legit and now i was able to buy a car and promise myself not to ride a jeep or a bus anymore jesse you have to check before making a comment i am inviting you to come to the philippines and see for yourself the power of uno premier reply jesse singh says january   at  pm hey if you don’t like my review you don’t have to be here 🙂 reply lovethestockmarket says february   at  am check this out if this company truly believes in making millionaires then why dont they give me k up front and i will pay them back as soon as i make k with their business model reply jesse singh says february   at  pm even though i am not in this company that comment is just insanity the truth is you have to do the work to become a millionaire no company will do that for you chances are you will give up after a week because that’s what the average people do… that’s why people struggle reply brume says february   at  am thks jesse this is what i need  knw i joined organo gold till date no earnin some chaps r tryin  talk me into uno but i decided  do my findings dis time pls let me knw abt ur model reply sophia says march   at  am regarding dropshipping do we need to find those items on the two websites ourselves reply jesse singh says march   at  pm sophia yes but there is a strategy behind it why not willing to put in the work reply tosin says april   at  pm hi jesse thanks for your review even though you sound sceptical i can see you are keeping it real uno premier is here in nigeria  the products have a mass appeal andare flying off the shelves especially the juice always running out of stock compared with other companies like trevo and organo gold the product prices are friendly only that i cannot attest to their claims as per health for this reason i decided to be a distributor and hoping to recruit a few serious minded people to help me earn the compensations available never been too good a recruiter though but at least i know the products have mass appeal unlike the other companies i joined before whose products are priced beyond the common man’s reach would like to hear about your company too if it can work in nigeria i will give it a try reply jesse singh says april   at  pm hey tosin thank you for commenting my friend 🙂 reply david says april   at  pm jesse thanks you for your review you are a kind of rightyou know some desperate people are being carried away by figures made by some of this mlm companies without underground search and investigations my conclusion isif this uno is that wonderful and has made  millionaireswhy are they not listed in removed link business from home one needs to think twices before getting involve uno is a different thing from uno premier as i understand thanks reply omeleh says june   at  pm interesting add me to your mailing list reply jesse singh says june   at  pm hey you got it 🙂 reply lendon says july   at  am hmm interesting can you add me to your mailing list thank you reply grace says july   at  pm well my question is who’s all those  millionaires i need to talk with someone of them… reply jesse singh says july   at  pm i am not sure that is what uno premier claims… reply tosan whyte says august   at  pm add me up to your business that’s not a scam reply jesse singh says august   at  am hey you got it reply fate says september   at  pm hey jesse it’s obvious you discredit companies to suit yourself how about you openly tell us what you do… you don’t need to convince people but you must put a company in a bad light to suit your selfish purpose reply jesse singh says september   at  am i actually didn’t put uno premier in a bad light maybe you need to read it again… reply vincent tawo says january   at  am actually this uno just came into nigeria and the registration fee is   after which you’ll be given some of their products to sell at choice while the sole aim is to refer people to join then you’ll get your percentage i decided to find out through this platform to know if they are real or fake what almost kill my interest in uno is the condition that if you don’t refer someone within hours your registration or account will be cancelled so i need someone to help my ignorance here reply ify says april   at  pm its notbtrue dear even if you go to sleep for months whenever you decide to workyour
