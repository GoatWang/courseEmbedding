ken macfadyen peter yus career path into private equity didnt follow a traditional route he never spent time as a consultant and didnt put in long hours as a junior banker before heading to wall street he spent a good portion of his early career in washington notably as a law clerk under outgoing supreme court justice john paul stevens and then later during the clinton administration as director to the national economic council the white house office that develops and coordinates economic policy its this background in diplomacy and compromise that prepared yu for the challenges of buying companies and investing in emerging markets he is not a proponent for example of seeking control as a way to mitigate risks rather he takes the opposite tack using minoritystake deals to align

here cartesian iris sees opportunity in natural catastrophe reinsurance june  emerging manager monthly natural catastrophes seem to be front page news on a daily basis whether it is an event such as hurricane katrina or the chilean earthquake or more recently the oil spill in the gulf of mexico but what many investors should be paying attention to is the investment opportunities these types of events can provide cartesian iris manages an absolute return fund focused on natural catastrophe reinsurance that invests in industryloss warranties which are shortterm investment contracts tied to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of specified largescale and lowprobability natural catastrophes cartesian capital group sponsored cartesian iris to provide superior riskadjusted returns that are uncorrelated with all other asset classes the noncorrelation is the focus of our strategy and why our offering resonates with investors said chase toogood ceo of iris reinsurance cartesian iriss bermudabased reinsurance company the multiple catastrophes early in the year led to the largest losses for a first quarter that the industry has ever seen toogood said which in turn creates opportunities for investors with capital losses tend to increase the cost of capital there is now less capital available out there for future risks than there was  months ago toogood said consequently the return on capital for certain risks has increased and for investors in cartesian iris toogood said they can sleep easy knowing that one major event will not bring down the portfolio as it is diversified among regions peril and structure we diversify the portfolio by creating exposures across a number of independent events this helps to reduce the downside risk for our investors he said the firms core competency lies in industry loss warranties according to toogood a further attraction of these contracts is their reliance on a thirdparty index for example cartesian iris might enter into a contract tied to the occurrence of a single hurricane that creates  billion of insured losses if such a storm occurredstatistically a rare eventthe contract would pay the counterparty typically an insurer or a reinsurer if no such storm occurred cartesian iriss investors would reap a significant gain by utilizing an index we are removing the indemnity and underwriting risk that we might have to a specific reinsurer or other counter party under a more traditional reinsurance contract toogood explained prior to launching the fund with cartesian capital group in january  toogood launched the catastrophe business in bermuda for credit suisse within  months after launch cartesian iris was able to raise  million a decent beginning in what was a difficult capital raising environment commented

wwwbuyoutsnewscomstoryaspstorycode in emerging markets investing still comes at a price september   by beina xu dow jones as much as emerging markets have been the tortoise in the race to rebound from the recession investors in the sector still have to tread carefully about what they invest in and where markets like india and china have come back with relative resilience capital markets in both countries have shown upside with increased ipo sightings but many risk profiles still remain challenging for investors to grapple with including pricing regulation corruption worries and as always cultural differences according to a panel at the dow jones private equity analyst conference in new york on thursday it pays to be highly selective in emerging markets said jonathon bond a partner with londonbased actis but it also pays to be an emerging market company pricing has become increasingly competitive – a premium that many private equity investors seem more willing to pay for entry into the market bond cited a deal actis closed in egypt for a  stake in a top bank for which it paid a little over two times book value most thoughtful investors are beginning to say that since its about growth perhaps its appropriate to pay higher prices for smaller returns he said although shailesh dash managing partner at global capital management said not all emerging markets were necessarily trading at that level what investors need to look for is inefficiencies in pricing rather than chasing the efficiencies according to cartesian capital groups peter yu the firm had funded an airline after  bought assets from enron and worldcom and most recently purchased shares in citibank and the best niches are still the most expensive bond said his firm still likes the chinese consumer story as well as the indian consumer market but that both were very fully priced north africa and brazil were also selectively attractive now were trying to recognize that were living in a world of permanently higher pricing bond said although the heat map may guide you on the macro level its now down to the gp to really build on sector expertise location expertise the growth is there its just about what price youre getting to pay to get on the escalator overall minority investments are the preferred path for myriad reasons most notably regulation and cultural gaps according to panelists out of the past  deals actis has done in the last  years around twothirds have been minority according to bond yu said cartesian has always preferred minority control with  to  ownership and a strong alignment in interest with the company soft power in emerging markets in pe is the preferred path he said but for dash soft power can only go so far in countries where regulation makes leveraged buyouts nearly impossible being slow helps cartesian has a gestation period per deal of around  months which it spends building relationships with sellers that oftentimes back out by month three yu said in some ways the phrase emerging markets is a little out of date yu said theres no one whod rather land in jfk terminal three than beijing terminal one the world has globalized – and the companies we select will be based on whether theyre globally competitive cartesian capital group comments on fondul proprietateas selection of franklin templeton as fund manager september   new york
