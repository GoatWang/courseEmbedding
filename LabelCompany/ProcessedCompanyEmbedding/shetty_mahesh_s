are dying due to the plastic factory waste that is being contaminated with drinking water and gk actually wants the villagers in pali to die which was why gk had the governments medical camp removed

that he was going to be killed raju inquires her about gks intentions who reveals that paranji discovered earlier that there is a large iridium deposit under pali which is worth billions and informed gk about it despite gks warning to paranji of not revealing it to anybody else he tries to inform the geological survey of india about the deposits which was why he and bilavar singh who was with him were killed that day gk suspects that raju might also know about the iridium deposit because he was with paranji when he was killed which was why gk sent govardhan to kill him not to retrieve subhashini raju was lured to girdwala under the cover of delivering the insurance check to bilavar singhs family gk had the insurance documents planted and was attacked by govardhan gk needs the strong plastic glass from the plastic factory to pack the iridium he wanted the pali villagers to vacate to dig the iridium ore without trouble on their own to avoid suspicion which was why he poisoned palis environment using the plastic factorys waste gk kills his assistant because she revealed everything to raju gk then heads to pali to kill all of the villagers before the truth goes out to the public the village head warns gk that raju is their god and that raju will bring death to gk and keep the palis population at  and not let anyone die in the wrath of gk raju arrives at pali

with a serious theme but director trivikram srinivas mixes it with a lot of unnecessary situational comedy which dilutes the intensity of the movie local review sites idlebrain and greatandhra gave a

that and that aint you there are some awesome people around us who are so very inspirational  we think we know them what we do know is how they look and maybe a few of their achievements on knowing what they have been through the kind of hurdles they have overcome the kind of loneliness they have encountered it sends deep shivers down our spine helplessly we find ourselves saying wow  here is one such story i am sure you have heard about him and seen his photographs i am sure a few of us have made good fun of him too after reading this life school message i am sure you will be amazed by his story please allow me to share with you the incredible story of the travails and glory of sylvester stallone i sincerely believe every person should be told this story  have you ever wondered why stallone has a unique expression on his face he seems like talking with a drawl right it seems like he is talking out of one corner of his mouth right right he was born with the lower part of his face paralyzed as a result of this his speech was always slurred it left him with parts of his tongue lips and chin paralyzed  can a person like this dare to become an actor and that too as a hero impossible isnt it wouldnt this inability sound the death knell for an acting career for everyone else yes for stallone no read on just imagine the ridicule he would have been subjected to his entire childhood it would have been so difficult for him to clearly express his thoughts his emotions in words the sounds he would make wouldnt come out properly he was an outcast among the school kids he often received suspensions for his squabbles and poor grades the first five years of his life stallone lived in an area known as hells kitchen he moved from one foster home to another as his parents fought miserably and endlessly in a bad marriage stallone wanted to pursue an acting career he tried out for nearly each and every casting call he could and contacted as many casting agents as he could find the result of every effort was a thumbs down one day stallone was watching on tv a fight between weppner and mohammad ali weppner was getting absolutely butchered but kept standing he was refusing to give up it was as if weppner was taunting mohammad ali to keep hitting him and he kept on coming back for more this underdog was really fighting for it despite the negligible chance of winning this inspired stallone to begin writing he could not sleep the whole weekend and wrote the script for rocky in about three days’ time  he began trying to sell the screenplay to many producers with enormous numbers of rejections this went on for months then he found himself broke he slept at the new jersey bus terminal for three weeks as he had no money to take a room in an act of desperation he waited outside of a local liquor store asking people if they would buy his dog his closest and best friend in the end someone bought his dog for roughly  stallone was extremely devastated that his life had come to that point he says this was the lowest point of his life he kept pursuing this story that he had written eventually someone liked it and they agreed to buy his script for   he wanted to play the part of the hero rocky they declined and insisted he sell the script to them stallone disagreed and told them he was the perfect actor for the heros role he declined their offer despite his current povertya couple of weeks later they contacted him with an even higher offer and stallone still insisted that he play rocky they once again declined can you believe this the man was poor he barely had money even for foodthe offer kept rising just so he would sell them the film without playing the part the price eventually got to around    and still he declined he was certain that he was the perfect person to play the role of the hero and that was it there would be no possibility of a compromiseeventually they offered stallone a measly  for the script as well as acting he accepted goodness gracious can you believe this the first thing stallone did was go back to the liquor store to buy back his doghe waited  days for the guy to come by and finally the guy came he offered the guy  to buy back the dog the man declined stallone was clear what he wantedit ended up costing him  and a part in the movie to buy back his dog the guy and the dog are in rocky the dog is credited as butkus stallone in the movie isnt that so cute imagine giving your pet your name too it makes my heart sing rocky made about  million sequels followed till date rocky has garnered over  billion stallone lived by his statement in rocky  rocky balboa let me tell you something you already know the world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows it’s a very mean and nasty place and i don’t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it ain’t about how hard you hit it’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take and keep moving forward that’s how winning is done now if you know what you’re worth then go out and get what you’re worth but you gotta be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody cowards do that and that ain’t you you’re better than that it won  nominations for the academy awards it famously won the academy award for best picture in  at the awards ceremony he read out all the rejection slips from those who said the film fill fail badly and no one would watch it how is this for persistence how is this for believing in your dreams how is this for winning against odds are you inspired if yes please share this story with as many people as possible let’s

                                                     airstotle developing leadership skills no one is a born leader—everyone can develop leadership skills and everyone can benefit from using them first take time to honestly analyze yourself learn to understand yourself it’s the first step to understanding others consider these important questions  what kind of leader am i     one who helps solve problems     a leader who helps people get along     how do others see me as a leader  what are my goals purposes and expectations in working with this particular group identify areas for improvement ask yourself these questions i do i try to be aware of how others think and feel ii do i try to help others perform to the best of their abilities iii am i willing to accept responsibility iv am i willing to try new ideas and new ways of doing things v am i able to communicate with others effectively vi am i a good problem solver vii do i accept and appreciate other perspectives and opinions viii am i aware of current issues and concerns on campus or in my community thenafter analyzing your strengths and weaknessestake action devise a strategy for upgrading your skills here are a few strategies to consider  communicate effectively    effective communication is dialogue barriers are created by speaking down to people asking closed  questions that elicit yes or no answers using excessive authority and promoting a culture that depends on unanimity if your focus is winning the argument or if you react defensively to criticism you’ll create fear of openness and hinder the organization’s growth try these steps to effective communication · listen activelyask open questions be genuinely interested in what other’s say · thank people for their opennessstress how much you value iteven if you don’t like specifically what is being said · point to areas of agreement before jumping on areas of disagreementthis reduces defensiveness members wont fear being “attacked” · set aside your authority to create an atmosphere of partnership to reduce fear in group members · promote a culture of constructive dissentthough not to the point of paralysis · portray disagreement as simply a difference of opinion get rid of the “i’m rightyou’re wrong” attitude  encourage enthusiasm and a sense of belonging    show · friendliness others will be more willing to share ideas if you’re interested in them as people too · understanding everyone makes mistakes try to be constructive tolerant and tactful when offering criticism · fairness equal treatment and equal opportunity lead to an equally good effort from all group members · integrity members will take tasks more seriously if you show that you’re more interested in group goals than your own personal gain  keep everyone working toward agreed upon goals · remind everyone of the group’s purposes from time to time it’s easy to become too narrowly focused and lose sight of the larger goals · provide encouragement and motivation by showing your appreciation for good ideas and extra effort · harmonize differences and disagreements between group members by stressing compromise and cooperation · involve everyone in discussions and decisions even if asking for opinions and ideas means a longer discussion  get to know the people around you everyone has different abilities wants needs and purpose in life to get along with others and get results you need to get to know them · interact with group members as often as possible the only way to get to know someone is through direct personal contact · become familiar with every member of your group take note of each person’s unique qualities and characteristics  treat others as individuals put your knowledge and understanding of each group member to work · be aware of expectations everyone expects something different recognition a chance to learn a chance to work with other people etc · be creative a repetitious routine can cause boredom a successful leader thinks of new and better approaches to old ways of doing things · provide rewards recognition by the group is a source of personal satisfaction and positive reinforcement for a job well done · delegate responsibilities if everyone shares the work everyone can share pride in the group’s accomplishments let each member know what’s expected of himher available resources deadlines etc  accept responsibility for getting things done · take the initiative why stand around and wait for someone else to get things started set an example · offer help and information your unique knowledge and skills may be just what’s needed · seek help and information ask for advice if you need it this will encourage group involvement and help accomplish group goals · make things happen by being decisive energetic and enthusiastic you can and will help get things done · know when and how to say “no” if your time and resources are already committed turn down extra tasks but do it nicely  problem solve in a stepbystep way whether you are faced with a decision to make or a conflict to resolve following a logical approach will help  state the problem as simply and clearly as possible  gather all relevant information and available resources  brainstorm as many ideas or solutions as you can think of with others if possible  evaluate each idea or solution and choose the best one  design a plan for using your idea or solution include a timetable assigned roles and resources to be used  follow up on your plan by asking if your idea worked and why or why not courtesy

river the little girl said  no dad you hold my hand  with puzzled mind dad asks   whats the difference   theres a big difference   replied the little girl if i hold your hand and something happens to me chances are that i may let your hand go  but if you hold my hand  i know for sure that no matter what happens  you will never let my hand go moral of the story  in any relationship  the essence of

education” article saved successfully to my page you must be logged in to save article a a  mr mahesh r shetty cmd mt educare ltd has more than  years of experience in the coaching industry he started the business of providing coaching services to students in school section in  under the brand of mahesh tutorials as chairman and managing director he provides vision leadership and strategic guidance to mt educare mr shetty is also the promoter of the company he was awarded the “pride of the nation award” by the all india achievers association in  mr shetty holds a bachelor’s degree in science from the university of mumbai established in  mt educare ltd is one of the leading education support and coaching services provider in maharashtra and has operations in other states like tamil nadu karnataka and gujarat mt educare also provides coaching for competitive examinations for admissions to universities offering masters in business administration degrees through its subsidiary chitale’s personalised learning private limited the company got listed on bse  nse on april   speaking with hemant p maradia of iifl mr shetty says “spend on the education sector is increasing almost a third of the income of middleclass families is going into education” what prompted you to opt for the ipo one was the visibility factor we feel that the education sector needs a lot of visibility in india we wanted public exposure to dispel the myth that the education sector is not scalable we also wanted national and international exposure we foresee synergies with international universities that are setting up shop in india we also wanted to reward our faculties that have been with us for a long time all of them have been given esops we also see some consolidation in the industry going forward and we would like to be part of this process how do you plan to use the ipo proceeds large part of the proceeds will be used for the college campus in mangalore secondly we are planning to set up  new coaching locations in fy and fy the balance ipo money will be utilised for general corporate purposes the ipo was worth rs mn only rs mn was inside the company so we are not talking of any large sum of money could you elaborate on your college tieup in karnataka basically the mangalore college campus is not owned by us neither do we operate it we basically are catering to the test prep for the college students it is an thth science college we get revenues from three sources first is from the test prep coaching secondly we are doing administrative management of the college we give them our content we train their teachers we also help them with the mis etc we get an administrative management fee we would like to do more such tiesups with colleges but we don’t want to invest we have already entered into such tieups at tumkur and hubli in karnataka post the ipo these are all existing colleges we have not put in any money we currently provide them with just test prep coaching going forward we would look at administrative management as well we are focusing only on karnataka as of now for this college model what will be the key growth drivers going ahead we started in  the areas that we would like to focus will in the schools segment we are also very strong in  science and in engineering entrance exam third area would be cpt and ipcc final we have also launched classes for cs and cwa we have also developed a technology platform which we have launched for the th standard we teach students ‘live’ at home from our classrooms the student doesn’t have to travel to our classes we form a group of  students from the same school we already have  students admitted for this platform there is scope of scalability in every area in maharashtra itself some  lakh students give the ssc board exam every year out of that we teach only about  students so there is enough to do there around  lakh students appear for science exam every year in maharashtra out of that we have around  students same goes for commerce steam we also see opportunity at the national level because of the joint entrance exam rule still we would like to focus only on four states where we are present currently maharashtra karnataka gujarat and tamil nadu in tamil nadu we are a very strong brand for ca we are no there in ca so there is a lot of scope in tamil nadu this year allindia ca final second rank student was from mt educare he is from tamil nadu we have many rankers in cpt as well as in ca finals we have keen interest in iitjee as well we are looking at the right opportunity we have the college model in karnataka then we are focusing in the sschsc segment in maharashtra streamwise  class growth is possible then there is  science and engineeringmedical entrance exam segments as well there is cpt ipcc and ca final segment there is also the college model through which we run our classes how do you see the outlook for the education sector spend on the education sector is increasing almost a third of the income of middleclass families is going into education including formal as well as supplementary coaching education ours is the grade improvement business our deliverables are different compared to the schools k schools are the alma matar of the children   we are here to ensure that the child performs better we are also into customised teaching this is a valueadded service delivered with the help of audiovisual technology reproduction at the time of the exams is the most important deliverable for us also india is becoming a knowledgebased economy now the size of this industry is rs bn in maharashtra which is a dominant state for us the post dropout rate has drastically reduced more and more kids are getting enrolled and we are gradually becoming one nation one exam kind of a system be it medical engineering or other professional courses the government has passed the right to education act so the government has taken up the responsibility to teach every child till the age of  in our opinion it is the sunrise sector the industry as well as the government is taking a keen interest in this sector private players like mt educare are giving back to the society we charge fees but also ensure that we impart quality education we are employing various technologies we ensure that teachers are trained in a particular fashion as well so the basic entrylevel deliverables are improving which was not the case earlier education was not looked upon as a viable career option by many teachers but today they are earning quite well we have given esops to our faculty we are focused on the outcome there is no point in taking up the education mandate by not delivering we are making sure that some students go for higher level of education like ca finals therefore we have a great future and immense potential we have studied the tier ii and tier iii markets as well what we got to know is that the disposable income is not very high in these towns we will either employ technology or go for school tieups or joint venture we may also go for a hybrid model where the delivery of education is through technology but there are some contact classes as well so it will be easy on the pockets of the students of tier ii and tier iii cities also the masses of these towns will get access to quality education at affordable rates we are in the process of evolving these different models for these towns what kind of investments are you looking at going forward investments would be the rent and capex of rs  per square feet upfront investments at each new location include security deposit and capex we want to continue to be asset light and avoid capitalheavy models we don’t want to get into k because we don’t want to build schools we don’t mind looking at k from a different perspective like tieups but we are not interested in investing in that segment none of our locations are owned by us they are all leased locations operated by us three locations are run through the franchisee route we do not want to focus on the franchisee model at all what is the capacity of a typical mt educare location one location has a capacity of  students physical capacity will be  seats but we rotate that capacity six times there are different verticals at each location such as science commerce etc the number of classes we can take at each location varies from course to course  are you able to find right kind of faculties that is never an issue because we have been in this business for the past  years plus we have taught lakhs of students over the years who in turn can opt to become our faculty it is never too difficult to get well qualified faculty we also have a very good training workshop a new teacher is trained roughly  hours even senior teachers go through  hours of training a year have you sold your preschool business we have signed a mou with tree house for the sale of our preschool business they have just completed the due diligence preschool is an insignificant part of our business it requires different kind of mindset and we do not want to use our management bandwidth in running that business are you looking at any acquisitions we continue to look at opportunities it has always been part of our growth process we will be interested in a target which offers a good fit for us either it needs to be a new product line that adds to our value chain or it could be an existing product line that will add complement our current business do you have any diversification plan we do not have any diversification plans we are contemplating how to develop the technology platform that we talked about before but nothing has been crystallized at this point in time what about the overseas markets we cater to students in dubai via a consultancy contract apart from that we are not looking at anything else for the overseas markets at least not in the next one or two years mt educare ltd bse    nse    area candlestick bar chart
