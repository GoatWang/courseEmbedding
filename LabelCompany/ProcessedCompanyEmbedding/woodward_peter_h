newman’s own food empire and the charitable foundation it supports in the hands of his adviser robert forrester but his eldest daughter says the family believes their father’s principles are being betrayedby mark sealaugust emailfacebooktwitterjoanne woodward youngest daughter clea and paul newman at a party for paul’s th birthday at la cave henri iv restaurant new york city january   digital colorization by vanity fair  globe photoszumapresscomthe first clue something was wrong was the change in the labelit was still playful and lighthearted radiating a message of goodness and giving on the packages of food products sold by newman’s own organics the allorganic spinoff of newman’s own specialty foods the old label had pictured movie star paul newman in an american gothic pose beside his daughter nell who had cofounded and run newman’s own organics alongside her father’s larger company blonde and beautiful with her father’s famously striking blue eyes nell shared his love of food philanthropy and the outdoors so it was strange when earlier this year her image went missing from the labels on the packaging of her company’s organic pretzels fig newmans and more than  other organic products as it turned out nell herself had gone missing from the company that she had started in her home in  in santa cruz california after convincing “pop” as she and her four sisters called their father that organic foods were the wave of the futurein reporting one of the first magazine profiles of nell and her allorganic crusade in  i encountered a forceful outspoken young woman who told me how she planned through pretzels her company’s first product to take the organicfood movement mainstream over the years i watched with wonder from afar as she made it happen within its first year newman’s own organics pretzels became the no  organic snack food in america and soon after her fig newmans were the no  organic cookie nell now  and her business partner peter meehan created an ever expanding catalogue of products that filled the shelves not only of organicfood stores but also of supermarkets from coast to coast in fact the organic line eventually threatened to become as popular as the salad dressing popcorn pizzaandspaghetti sauce and nearly  other products sold by the nonorganic newman’s own food empire which had been founded in 9 by paul newman and his friend the writer a e hotchnerwhat was behind this extraordinary vanishing act of paul newman’s daughterbefore he was a food entrepreneur paul newman was one of the great movie stars from the 9s through the 9s not only a heartthrob with chiseled features and piercing blue eyes but also a seriously accomplished actor along with montgomery clift james dean and marlon brando he came out of lee strasberg’s legendary actors studio and like the others he often portrayed roughhewn charismatic outsiders newman’s own version of this prototype was handily described by shawn levy in his  biography paul newman a life “for fifty years onscreen and off newman vividly embodied certain tendencies in the american male character active and roguish and earnest and sly and determined and vulnerable and brave and humble and reliable and compassionate and fair” newman perfected this character in a string of popular movies that featured his icy masculine cool the hustler 9 hud 9 cool hand luke 9 butch cassidyand thesundance kid 99 and the sting 9 among otherspaul joanne and daughters clockwise from left clea nell melissa and stephanie in 9 digital colorization by lorna clark by milton h greene  archiveimagescom newman’s macho screen image was reinforced by his personal life which he kept private he neither preened for the paparazzi nor pursued the glamorous life lived by other hollywood stars of his caliber he preferred to putter around his spacious but hardly spectacular room colonial in westport connecticut on  acres with his second wife the actress joanne woodward and their children his hobby was auto racing and he was no dabbler he won four national amateur titles two professional race victories a secondplace finish at the  hours of le mans and a victory in his team’s class at daytonain later years newman also came to be much admired for his charitable activities his newman’s own foundation which is entirely supported by the profits of the newman’s own food empire has supported good works to the tune of  million since its creation and it continues today to help fund programs in four main “focus areas” children with lifelimiting conditions empowerment nutrition and encouraging philanthropywhat about bobafter newman’s death in  one person took charge of his legacy—both the food company and the related charitable foundation robert h forrester he met me one morning in the then westport offices of newman’s own inc where images and reminders of paul newman are everywhere on movie posters and in photographs on the office walls and on the memorabilia scattered about newman’s pool table and popcorn machine are still there too to begin my visit forrester played a promotional video made in  in which newman is once again at his side “he could have been interviewed in the video by anybody else” said forrester proudly “and paul said to me ‘i want you’ ”the two men were complementary simply wanting to give away the company’s ever increasing profits newman loathed the details of business while forrester reveled in them “ ‘forrester what’s going to happen when i croak’ ” forrester remembered the man he calls his “great friend” asking “and i said ‘if you somehow figure out how to come back for a visit  years after you pass it will feel right to you’ ”whitehaired and wearing a green gingham shirt beneath a green vnecked sweater forrester  seemed to me like a kindly and earnest uncle for four hours he and his sizable staff explained how they are preserving and expanding newman’s legacy “paul didn’t give his heart easily but he put a lot of trust in bob” said pamela papay who became newman’s own inc’s first employee in 9 “bob was a giver and not a taker”a veteran consultant to nonprofit organizations forrester was enlisted by newman in  to straighten out problems the actor was having in opening his first foreign hole in the wall gang camp named after the wyoming mountain pass where butch cassidy’s wild bunch outlaw gang hid out for seriously ill children the two men eventually became such close friends that forrester worked for  years for newman and his organization for free forrester says and donated  million of his own money to newmanrelated charities in  newman appointed forrester as the first president and coo of the newman’s own foundation and later chairman and ceo of newman’s own inc and coexecutor of his will in the six years since newman’s death forrester told me the food company’s topline revenue has grown  percent in compounded annual revenues and the newman’s own foundation has given away more than  million“there’s no other company out there doing anything like this where every cent we make we give away” said mike mcgrath who introduced wolfgang puck soup and helped sell it to campbell’s in  before succeeding forrester as ceo of newman’s own inc in “we always say it’s about quality trumping the bottom line that’s what paul said it’s all for the common good” said newman’s own inc’s new president and coo dave best whose former jobs at general mills and unilever involved managing such iconic brands as cheerios and hamburger helperat the end of our meeting i joined the staff for an allnewman’s own lunch before being sent off with a baggie of newman’s own cookies i found it all inspiring and uplifting but even while the foundation remains a global force in funding good works some people have doubts about whether newman’s wishes are truly being fulfilled the questions have come from some of paul newman’s daughters and friends and also according to sources from joanne woodward who upon hearing the details of the disposition of her husband’s reported  million estate allegedly exclaimed “oh my god that’s not what it was supposed to be”“whether my family will go public with our complaints or not there isn’t a single living newman who respects or has faith in robert forrester and his management of my father’s food company newman’s own foundation or the continuation and protection of his legacy” paul newman’s eldest daughter susan kendall newman tells me susan  is a former actress and awardwinning television producer who supplies media and production services for nonprofit organizations friends describe her as smart outspoken and possessing a strong social consciencenewman’s own employees from left lori dibiase dave best kelly giordano mike mcgrath ron restani pamela papay and robert forrester photograph by ben hoffman grooming by susan phear produced on location by susan phear “some family members may be angry at me for speaking out” says susan “but i feel like the newman family has been taken hostage by bob forrester i think mr forrester has forgotten that it is a privilege and enormous responsibility for him to preside over my father’s legacy and carry out his wishes he seems to be more interested in selfaggrandizement and lavish trappings forrester says this characterization of him is “totally untrue” my father would never support many of the things he is doing”her four sisters are all distressed by the situation susan says the two oldest daughters from newman’s 9 marriage to actress jacqueline witte are susan who lives in california and stephanie  who leads a quiet life away from the family business and foundation a son scott died in 9 newman’s three daughters from his second marriage to joanne woodward are nell  melissa “lissy” elkind  who has volunteered at a connecticut women’s prison and claire “clea” soderlund  who has long been involved in philanthropy in westport and beyond but the others have remained silent for fear of making the current situation worse susan says or are bound by confidentiality agreements“i will not be muzzled any longer” she sayssalad days‘it was just a joke a lark” yearold writer a e hotchner said sitting in his sunny westport house four miles from the newmans’ former home he and newman met in 9 when newman starred in the battler a television play hotchner had written based on a hemingway short story the two men quickly became lifelong close friends hotchner jokingly claims in his  memoir paul and me that they bonded over being the two most inept fishermen everhotchner recalled how a few days before christmas in 9 newman phoned to say “how about coming over and giving me a hand with something” hotchner did only to find his friend drinking beer in his barn with “a big washtub of vinegar and olive oil and condiments and a lot of dirty wine bottles it was ridiculous but it was fun we drank beer and we mixed up the stuff”“the stuff” was newman’s soontobefamous salad dressing which he had bottled for years and given away newman and hotchner tied ribbons around the wine bottles gathered their kids and went christmas caroling distributing the bottles along the way one of newman’s neighbors then was a young caterer named martha stewart who held a blind taste test newman’s was voted no  calling it newman’s own newman allowed his face to be put on the label in 9 the dressing went on sale in local gourmet shops and groceriesrecalled hotchner “to our absolute disbelief we banged quite a profit that first year”—9 in fact “paul said ‘we can’t be in the business of making money off of it you’re a writer and i’m an actor and this isn’t what we do let’s give it all away to charity’ ”“nothing like it” hotchner continued remembering the joy of those giddy exuberant early days when newman tirelessly promoted his food products in 9 they established the first hole in the wall gang camp serving  children by  the camps would reach  children worldwidein 9 newman’s life imploded when his only son scott died of an accidental drugandalcohol overdose at the age of  in a room in a los angeles ramada inn scott had endured a troubled adolescence getting kicked out of several prep schools for using drugs and alcohol and for disruptive behavior as a young adult he decided to follow in his father’s footsteps and become an actor but he met with little successnewman was wracked with anguish over his son’s death “i think about him … often … it hurts” he told hotchner on a fishing trip in the bahamas “the guilt the guilt all i could have done … and didn’t do… and all i did was make more movies and be a big star” his biggest regret was that he and his son had never really discussed his son’s problemsin 9 when the remorse and grief were still fresh newman opened the scott newman center in torrance california it provided drugprevention education in schools and other places in the community with his son gone newman turned his attention to his five daughters to inspire them to follow in his philanthropic footsteps he began giving each of them  annually—to donate to charities of their choosingin  nell then the director of the ventana wilderness sanctuary in central california where she was working to reestablish the baldeagle population was seized by the idea to create an allorganic division of newman’s own her father unfamiliar with the concept of organic food wasn’t convinced so that thanksgiving nell packed a suitcase full of organic california produce flew to westport and cooked thanksgiving dinner for the family after “pop” cleaned his plate she whispered in his ear “how did you like your allorganic thanksgiving dinner” newman’s own organics was born with nell’s company donating a royalty in exchange for using her father’s name and image on the packaging by  she had given away more than  million‘it is no secret that i will soon be completing my th year on this planet” paul newman wrote in a letter he addressed to “the newman clan all” on may  999 “that it will be twenty years since scott died that we are approaching the millennium the convergence of the above begs for some gathering of family … for all of you to ask questions of your aging father while the opportunity still exists questions about my intention as regards to family questions about expectations about history family responsibilities trusts business continuity charity—in short everything”newman’s longtime attorney leo nevas then  drafted a sixpage letter outlining newman’s estate plans which included “give paul’s children the major voice in the distribution of a large part of the funds for charity” newman asked his assistant to distribute the attorney’s letter to his wife and daughters and wrote across the top “this seems to be where we are headed pop”nell photographed by annie leibovitz  in  the newman’s own foundation was established and two years after that newman began to “withdraw” as a e hotchner wrote in his memoir he burned his tuxedo in hotchner’s driveway and vowed never to attend another blacktie event he made his last movie as the voice of doc hudson the retired carracing judge and doctor in the  pixar hit cars and then he began to relinquish his involvement in newman’s own“every december for  years paul and i shared a pastrami sandwich a root beer and licorice jelly beans while selecting a steadily increasing number of recipients of our profits which reached a total of  million in  the last year paul participated” wrote hotchner by then newman had told him “hotchnik it’s time we got out of the grocery business you and i and brought in professionals”“a board of directors was installed with a very knowledgeable chairman robert forrester who organized the charitable arm of the company into a foundation” hotchner wroteforrester would be the head of the newman’s own foundation but according to earlier planning documents newman’s daughters were intended to be substantially involved each would receive an inheritance of  upon their father’s death to follow in his footsteps each daughter was to have a foundation set up for her to be funded with assets from their father’s estate the documents suggested that  percent of their father’s residual estate would be equally distributed among their foundations with the remaining  percent left to support joanne woodwardincluding his daughters in his will was a major departure “from the time we were children our father informed us there would be no inheritance” susan says “he felt large sums of money eroded your ambition and mostly sabotaged your life we all accepted this that’s not to say that financial assistance wasn’t forthcoming over the years in my mids he called a family meeting and told us he was making some provisions for us after all apparently joanne had convinced him to do so”but newman had often changed his estate plans “the distribution of paul newman’s assets was governed by the terms of a trust created in 9” says brian murphy newman’s los angelesbased business manager and accountant of  years and coexecutor of his will “over the years the trust was amended twelve times the last being in april  six months before paul’s death”in  susan newman met with robert forrester in paul newman’s new york city office at his fifth avenue apartment “i was told each daughter would inherit a million dollars which was a sizable increase over what we had been told previously and my father would set up foundations for each of us” she says “mr forrester also told me they would be funded with up to  million or more per daughter” she adds “newman’s own foundation would have some cursory supervision over them and the moneys had to be distributed within a finite period of time” in addition the daughters were to serve on the newman’s own foundation board and the entity that controlled the hole in the wall gang camps with “one daughter perhaps two serving on its board of directors on a rotating basis” according to documents outlining newman’s preliminary estate plansthat year other meetings among newman’s advisers and his daughters commenced “these weren’t casual gatherings” says susan “they were wellorchestrated meetings that required some of us to fly in from out of state there were business advisers lawyers accountants and authorities in family philanthropy we were told very specific things not only about the future of our father’s businesses primarily philanthropic but our daughterly responsibilities as my father envisioned them of course there were ongoing conversations with our father as well” forrester responds “factually i have no basis upon which to say what level of knowledge all his daughters had about his final estate plans while he did ask me to speak with them in  about what was then the direction in which his thinking was taking him he also asked that i make sure they all knew it was preliminary thinking on his part”a e hotchner and paul in 9 courtesy of newman’s own foundation when newman had turned  in  he was still jogging up and down the stairwells of the hotels where he stayed during trips to the car races in which he and his team competed he subsisted on burgers and beer as he flew to the races with his pals on newman air his name for his small sabreliner business jet at home he was religious about exercising on his versaclimber until drenched with sweaton august   in an outtake from the promotional video interview with robert forrester newman spoke of his intentions for his family “all my children get a certain amount to be able to give away every year and they will be giving away my estate as well… yes they are involved they sit on the board of the companies and the foundation”around the time newman made that video the pain began first in his back the doctors found a spot on his lung which was partially removed the pain persisted then another diagnosis it was leukemia“during these some weeks in the hospital i’m reminded that i haven’t been extraordinarily communicative” paul wrote on february   to his lifelong friend the screenwriter stewart stern whose credits include such classics as rebel without a cause “actually for the first week i didn’t know where i was in fact weeks ago i can remember asking joanne with confusion ‘what happened’ she said ‘you don’t remember going to the hospital at four o’clock in the morning something short of insane’ i didn’t”this period some say is when major changes in his estate planning were made“many people who have executed a will when they are hale and hearty sometimes have a panic motion with the imminence of death” observes a close friend of newman’s “and a lot of it has to do with whoever has the most influence on them in those last few weeks or months before they die … their lawyer or doctor or priest… i’m not saying it happened here”newman continued to meet with various attorneys and advisers often in his office in the barn of his westport property he had always disliked such technical business meetings so he would go into the room express his wishes and then leave saying i’ll be back lateron april   six months before his death newman with the assistance of a new lawyer rewrote his will four months later on august  a medical report stated “memory loss continues to be a serious issue” by then he would call his nonagenarian attorney’s westport office instead of his new attorney sometimes making suggestions on issues that had already been decidedasked about newman’s state of mind in his final days forrester says he “remained lucid made wellreasoned decisions and was fully in control of his planning at least until a couple of weeks of his passing”postmortemon september   newman died at age  surrounded by his family the reading of the will in a westport hotel was supposed to be routine—at least for newman’s wife and daughters he and his advisers had repeatedly expressed his intentions they believed“then we had the rug pulled out from under us” says susanmost everything that the daughters felt they had been promised was gone there was nothing about one or two daughters rotating on the newman’s own foundation board because forrester says newman had changed his mind “paul never thought of newman’s own as a family enterprise for him it was always about the public good at one time he was giving some thought to having one daughter on each board serving a timelimited term but ultimately decided against doing so”the millions that had been discussed as going into their personal foundations— percent of newman’s residual estate—went to joanne woodward’s marital trust and the daughters’ foundations would not be funded until after her death to ensure that woodward would be adequately cared forsince its creation the sole member of the newman’s own foundation had been paul newman on july 9 two months before his death newman signed a “written consent of sole member” document appointing robert forrester and brian murphy as his foundation’s second and third members forrester explains “around the time of our june  board meeting paul asked brian murphy and me to join him as members of the foundation a consent document to this effect was drafted by legal counsel and signed by paul on july 9 … as sole members we appoint the board of the foundation and approve bylaws once this has been done the board of directors has fiduciary and governance responsibilities for the affairs of the foundation approving policies plans budgets grants etc further it is the foundation board of directors not the foundation’s members who are responsible for appointing members to the board and for approving the bylaws of newman’s own inc the food company”but according to susan “the keys to the kingdom had virtually been given to one man bob forrester”“prior to my father’s death mr forrester’s favorite word was ‘transparency’ ” she says “i had never heard the word thrown around as frequently as he used it after my father passed away and every plan had been changed andor deferred if we asked any questions we were accused of being adversarial mr forrester became less available and when we were in communication he could easily become riled up forrester says he continues “to work with members of the newman family on a regular basis” and knows of “no unanswered questions” soon after he had control of the foundation it seemed like almost everyone who walked through the door employees contract workers and others was being asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement it’s almost impossible to get a straight answer some of us receive calls from people with serious concerns but they fear reprisals with their employment retirement packages or contracts in some cases they’re nervous about whether their funding will be reduced or discontinued ultimately those concerns prevent any public disclosure” forrester responds “it has been a long standing practice predating my involvement with newman’s own that employees business partners advisors and members of our boards sign confidentiality agreements”some of the daughters considered asking for a day continuance before the will was filed for probate “we discussed this with many lawyers and they said it was not unusual to ask for an extension to better understand the changes and new provisions but forrester responded ‘no absolutely not’ then there were immediate warnings” says susan “ ‘you’re contesting the will and could be disinherited’ ever since then we’ve been walking on eggshells” forrester says he has no recollection “of such a conversation and that kind of request would have been made not to me but to the lawyers”newman’s son scott on location for the great waldo pepper from mptvimagescom each daughter might still be able to make recommendations for grants to charities of her choosing as newman had planned but with stipulations “final authority for grantmaking decisions is solely reserved by the foundation’s board of directors” they were advised in a letter from forrester four days after their father’s death there were no guarantees that the program would continue that allocation levels wouldn’t change yeartoyear or that the foundation board would approve every recommendationforrester insists that woodward knew about all of her husband’s estate plans others say any mention of the changes upset her to the point where the subject became taboo “joanne’s dislike for bob is well known within her inner circle” says susan woodward was not available for comment“my dad was a brilliant guy with many diverse talents but he didn’t trust people” susan says “sadly it is my belief that he had a propensity for trusting the wrong people i am terribly concerned about my father’s legacy… frankly i feel there are just too many questions about my father’s health at the time he was making extremely important decisions … we weren’t the only ones affected loyal household staff longtime employees and some loved ones had their trusts deferred or were written out entirely”particularly troubling to some was the alleged disappearance of a codicil to newman’s will in which he bequeathed one of his racecars to his driver a source close to the trustees insists the codicil never existed however some friends and family members believed the mysterious codicil to which newman’s longtime housekeeper and one of his nurses supposedly served as witnesses was simply never filed and they viewed this as evidence of possible irregularities the driver filed a complaint in a connecticut court depositions were taken but the complaint was eventually droppedcontroversy erupted when newman’s passion his newmanhaas racing team was defunded for the  season although newman had allegedly specified that the support was to be continued “even though forrester understood that paul wanted to support the team the following year he said joanne’s estate could not afford that and hopefully we would understand that as of that day the newmans’ participation was out” recalls mike lanigan a former racingteam partner of newman’s forrester says he has “no role in woodward’s estate or personal financial affairs” lanigan says he spent considerable time with newman shortly before his death “he would tell me what he wanted shortly before he died” he says “i don’t think his wishes in a number of subjects were fulfilled i’m not talking about the race team i’m talking about the whole scenario of his estate”also defunded was the scott newman center founded by paul newman amidst his personal devastation over his son’s tragic death in  newman’s own foundation officials announced that they didn’t intend to continue as the center’s primary donor and insisted that a consultant of their choosing be hired for planning and fundraising new sources of funding were not found however and the center closed in may  “paul was very much involved in making this decision in fact it was paul who first expressed a concern about the center’s continuing viability” forrester says “this was in  when it became clear that the center had developed such an overdependency on funding from newman’s own that it was on the verge of losing its taxexempt status as a public charity we reached out to them at that time and offered to work together on their achieving greater financial selfsufficiency… regrettably despite well in excess of a million dollars in grants from the foundation over a fouryear period and a tremendous amount of donated time the center could not make any substantial progress in broadening its base of support and its board made the decision to discontinue operations”after her father’s death according to a source nell newman was prevented from releasing new products because newman’s own inc might want to release the same products long discussions over nell’s licensing agreement to use her father’s name and image set to expire on december   broke down and her license was not renewed she was told she was a disqualified person the taxcode term barring relatives of the founder of a private foundation in some cases but not nell’s some attorneys would insist from working for a company owned by a foundation so nell offered to work for the company for free but was turned down once newman’s own organics was thought to be worth between  and  million but the company’s value would have been reduced greatly if it could no longer use paul newman’s name or image launching a new company would mean jeopardizing the employment security of her  employees without employees or products nell decided she had no other choice but to turn her company back over to newman’s own inc and walk away according to a source her name and image began to disappear from the label newman’s own inc now sells most of her organic productsagain forrester says the decision was paul newman’s “it was always the intention that organics would someday be reintegrated into newman’s own when its license expired” he says “as organic foods became more mainstream having two separate companies with essentially the same brand selling into a single market was becoming increasingly confusing having the newman’s own brand back in one place was something paul was encouraging and supporting us and newman’s own organics to do starting in  and up until his passing he was actively involved in efforts to accomplish this and it was one of his greatest hopes that he would have seen this done during his lifetime”others find it difficult to believe that newman would have wanted his daughter to leave the company she founded “paul was one proud fellow when nell was so very very passionate about her belief in organics and he wasn’t you know” stewart stern told me shortly before his death at 9 last february “he had to have it proven to him because it was business and it was proven or there wouldn’t have been the two of them on all those cans and boxes and everything else it seems fantastic to me that it is possible that there’ll be any change in that”i asked the foundation’s publicity representative if a member of paul newman’s family would speak to me in their support and received this statement from clea soderlund who remains a foundation vice president “from a very young age our parents taught us that being a good citizen in your community and giving back should be a priority if you were as lucky as we were… i am very proud to be a part of his legacy… it is a special gift and an honor”paul in 9 by fred squillanteap images for susan newman and others it’s now more complicated “my father didn’t believe in what he called noisy philanthropy he didn’t need the ego stroking of having his name on the side of a building he wanted the money to go directly to the camp kids and charities in the early days my dad used to get a kick out of his conference table being a pingpong table robert forrester has bought a building i’ve heard the total cost after renovation is between  million and  million it may be more” while declining to comment on the cost forrester says “newman’s own had some time ago seriously outgrown the space available to it… management explored all options including leasing and buying new facilities… the board of directors made the decision to purchase our new home”“as paul’s eldest daughter i feel a responsibility call it a duty to fulfill his wishes and safeguard his legacy” continues susan “there are too many glaring examples of mr forrester’s decisions’ being out of sync with the beauty and integrity that is essential to my father’s philanthropic legacy that has got to change” forrester counters “this could not be further from the facts… everything we are doing today is in line with paul’s way of doing things… the company has continued to prosper financially while staying  percent committed to the value proposition of ‘quality trumps profits’ and the philanthropic practices we follow today are ones established with paul”the truth of what paul newman wanted may have to remain a mystery said stern who was also extremely close to joanne woodward “like all great heroes paul was flawed some of those flaws have been appearing in the lives of people who were left behind in the swirl of his going he would share everything and absolutely nothing and it was the nothing part that was so very very very confusing even to his best of friends… he was enigmatic to a degree that i have never experienced with anybody else… i don’t know and nobody knows precisely what the whole thing is in terms of paul’s wishes or settlements”shareemailfacebooktwittermark sealmark
