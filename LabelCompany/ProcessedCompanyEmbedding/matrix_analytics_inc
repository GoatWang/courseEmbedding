trusted by students since     todays opening times    bst apple inc market analysis print reference this apa mla mla harvard vancouver wikipedia published rd march  last edited th june  this essay has been submitted by a student this is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers keywords apple bcg matrix apple ansoff matrix according to kotler marketing is not like euclidean geometry a fixed system of concepts and axioms rather marketing is one of the most dynamic fields within the management arena the marketplace continuously throws out fresh challenges and companies must respond therefore it is not surprising that new marketing ideas keep surfacing to meet the new marketplace challenges varadarajan  product price promotion and place are factors that within limits are capable of being influenced or controlled marketing strategy can be viewed as reflecting a marketing mix of these four elements oshaughnessey  market planning involves the logical sequence and a series of activities leading to the setting of marketing objectives and the formulation of plans for achieving them marketing tools are used in the realisation of market plans this paper aims to critically evaluate how apple inc could use some of the main strategic marketing tools product life cycle ansoff matrix boston matrix etc to develop and manage its products and product portfolios some of the advantages and limitations observed will also be discussed  background of apple inc apple was founded in  by steve wozniak and steve jobs with the aim of providing userfriendly computers to a set of computer hobbyists david  pg  the first computer they made had no keyboard or power supply and they were able to sell about  of such computers which they called apple  international directory of company history  later that year they began working on apple ii with the intention of reaching a greater market segment apple ii was a success and made more than  million in annual sales apple ii stored information on cassette tapes and that made them very slow apple improved on this memory problem in  with apple ii and made  more sales than that of the previous year international directory of company history  apple iii was launched in  to break into the office market dominated by ibm however the computer was released without adequate testing and many of its unit were defective production was stopped and the problem was fixed but apple iii was not as successful as apple ii in the market and it was discontinued in  international directory of company history  the company forged ahead despite the failure of apple iii and released more than  software programs it became the first personal computer to reach  billion in annual sales in  international directory of company history  steve wozniak left apple in  and john sculley was hired to be the company president steve jobs was eventually forced out of the company too apple turned down microsofts appeal for the license of their macintosh operating system microsoft went on to develop dos operating system which soon became the international operating standard for more than  of all personal computers in the world david  pg  apple experienced a lot of problems with poor management and failed products over the next couple of years and its financial losses reached a staggering  billion in  its share price fell from  in  to  and its lost majority of its market share international directory of company history  steve jobs returned as the ceo of apple in  and began making efforts to right all the wrongs that had been made over the years he instantly forged a relationship with microsoft which included the release of macintoshs version of microsofts popular office software david  pg  he went on to eliminate  of the companys  products international directory of company history  as they were not making profits he introduced the imac a sleek and colourful computer in  david  pg  the imac was a great success and apples annual sale for that year was  billion they experienced continuous growth and their stock made a  increase to  by the end of  international directory of company history  the ipod was introduced in  and over million units has been sold the itunes online store was launched in  it is a platform where people can download music and pay for it and it has gone on to become the biggest online music store recording more than  billion downloads in january  the mac book pro was launched anonymous  in january  the iphone and apple tv were launched and apple computer inc became apple inc to accommodate its wide range of products anonymous   the marketing mix according to professor peter doyle the selection of the target market and design of the marketing mix are the two key decisions that determine the success of a firm in a new market baker  marketing comprises of a number of elements and the relationshipinterdependencies between these elements is referred to as the marketing mix cartwright  the marketing mix is made up of four basic components that can be combined in a number of ways to achieve different end results baker  and these are product place people and promotion only the product will be discussed in details for the purpose of this paper  product a product has been defined as tangible in the past but we are at the age where that definition is no longer adequate as it does not completely capture the whole essence of a product a product is defined as a combination of both tangible and intangible properties for the sole purpose of customer satisfaction baker marketing strategy and management  a product is more than just the food a customer eats at a restaurant it includes all the services rendered such as convenience speed mobility etc cheverton   the product life cycle a typical product goes through different stages in its life time and this is referred to as the product life cycle this is illustrated with the diagram below   introduction the introductory stage is crucial to the life of a product it is advisable for companies to invest a lot of money into advertisement at this stage to ensure they are able to make sufficient impact upon entry into the market cartwright  the rate of growth and investment at this stage is inversely proportional cheverton  growth there is a change in marketing strategy at this stage and the cost on advertising reduces as the customers are aware of the brand assael  pg  resulting in a lot of market growth a lot of sales are usually generated at this stage due to customer awareness it is usually very good to be the first company to pass through successful unchartered water however as soon the success become obvious other companies will wish to enter the market cartwright  maturity this is the most profitable stage however the product is capable of little or no further developments an effective marketing mix is essential for survival at this stage as competition becomes stiff and competitors will do anything to survive in the market baker  hart product strategy and management  pg    there are too many players in the market at this stage and it is imperative for organizations to come up with new products or improvement on existing products cartwright  decline with decline in sales impending death is inevitable and the company can either redesign the product or totally withdraw it assael  pg   analysis of the iphone family using the product life cycle every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything these were the words of steve jobs at the launch of the iphone in january  jobs had noticed an opportunity in the mobile handset market two years prior and set apples engineers in motion to develop the iphone grossman  which was to save people the stress of carrying both an mp player and a phone and the cost of purchasing the two items the iphone marked apples entrance into the mobile handset market it combines the features of the ipod smart phones and mobile computing into one device the user interface is built around a new input technology called multi touch and the only physical button on the iphone is the home key every other feature is virtual honan  introduction the buildup to the introduction of the iphone was second to none it generated over  million hits on google prior to its launch koeppel  the popularity translated to huge sales and apple reported selling more than one million iphones within the first quarter financial statements  there were some mistakes with the marketing strategy for the iphone and the obvious one was in the price slash just three months after its introduction vertygo team  the early adopters were outraged but steve jobs made efforts to pacify them by offering  store credit that customers could use in purchasing at retail apple stores or online mickalowski mickelson  keltgen  growth apple inc introduced iphoneg a little over a year after the first iphone was launched the iphone g was compatible with g networks which translated into higher connection speed at half the price of the original iphone it promised better battery life and also included a builtin gps macworld  iphone g was highly successful and apple sold more than  million units of the handset united states securities and exchange commission  the sale of the iphone expanded beyond the us and the company had a target of reaching  countries before the end of  however the contract with att increased by more than  from the monthly charge of the previous model therefore even though the iphoneg was cheaper customers will end up spending more over the twoyear contract with att macworld  june  marked the launch of yet another iphone this time the iphonegs the features include hands free control longer battery life it also included the soft ware iphone os  a new software capable of a lot of functionalities such as copy and paste mms etc vertygo team  it had larger memory capacities and was again cheaper than the previous model the product was well accepted by the market and apple sold more than  million units of the iphone and witnessed a growth of  from the previous year sale united states security and exchange commission  in june  the company again introduced a new iphone the iphone  this included such features as face time ability for callers to see each other while making phone calls provided they are both using the iphone  mega pixel camera etc building on the success of the previous iphones the fourth generation of the iphone recorded an instant success upon its launch the company declared more than  growth in its iphone net and unit sales for the year ended september  this success was attributed in part to the huge demand on the iphone  united states securities and exchange commission  advantages of the plc the plc helps organizations plan and make allowance for the eventualities of products the realisation that every product will die if not improved or modified in some ways help organizations work hard at constantly improving their products this fact is not lost on apple inc and the company strives to constantly improve on its products or add new features to its existing products apple inc is probably the company that understands the importance of the product lifecycle the most and they usually replace their own product with a new product while its still in the growth stage average of a year after its launch the strategy is commendable as it ensures that no competitor takes their position and their market share disadvantages of the plc a number of limitations were observed with the plc and these are it has no time limits associated with the stages thereby making it difficult to estimate exactly what stage a product is in its lifecycle for instance in the case of the apple inc the iphone gs was still enjoying a lot of sales and the introduction of the iphone could have been delayed for a couple of months more to milk the sales of the iphone gs to the maximum it can cause a company to kill its own product prematurely because of the need to retain their position in the market this could be seen in the case of the iphone gs with the new iphone  the decline of the iphone gs is imminent sooner rather than later even though every product will decline eventually the plc does not take the effect of technology into consideration the lifecycle of the iphone could be extended by constant introduction of new applications lastly not every product goes through the stages in the life cycle as it is possible for products to go from introduction to decline etc  risk analysis using the ansoff matrix the ansoff matrix is a strategic marketing tool that proposes ways in which organisations seeking growth can come up with a strategy that encompasses risk analysis directional policy portfolio management etc lancaster  massingham  cim  the framework of this tool is shown below   the cells strategies in the matrix are market penetration the market penetration strategy has the lowest risk involved and as such the easiest route to take it involves expansion of sales in existing market and this can be achieved by expanding distribution channels improving service performance price slashes increasing the frequency of usage etc cim  aaker  mcloughlin  the most important aim is for a company to increase their market share market development this is a strategy of growth based on entering new markets countries and targeting new segments aaker  mcloughlin  product dvelopment this strategy is based on developing new products for existing markets lancaster  massingham  diversification this is the most risky of all the strategies as it involves delving into a totally new market with a totally new product wmg   managing apple inc product portfolio using the ansoff matrix market penetration although apple inc is doing a fantastic job with this strategy there is still ample room for growth and this can be achieved using the increase in product usage approach aaker  mcloughlin  apple could increase the iphone usage by targeting the older people  years and above they currently do not find the iphone appealing because it lacks a keypad and as such it will be difficult to use a solution is to come up with an iphone that combines all the current features of an iphone with a keypad an iphone that displays a keypad when slid up might be a good place to start market development one of the strategies apple inc can adopt in increasing its growth is geographic expansion aaker  mcloughlin  there are still so many countries where the iphone and ipad are not yet been sold acquiring more markets will translate to more sale and ultimately more market share product development this involves line extensions developing new products for existing markets expanding product scope etc aaker  mcloughlin  there is a huge problem usually encountered when using the macintosh computers to browse or download software as most vendors are not familiar with the operating system and this could be frustrating for users it is important for apple to bridge this technological gap by introducing a more compatible operating system and applications diversification from computers to mp players to iphones to ipad apple inc knows all about diversification and it has worked for them even though it is the most risky of all the growth strategies if successful the roi return on investment could be huge apple recently entered the tablet market and they own  of the market share within just months of launching the ipad advantages of the ansoff matrix the ansoff matrix is very useful in coming up with a growth strategy for an organization apple inc explores all the possible growth opportunities and it has helped in their growth and expansion it has also pointed out areas where there is still room for growth and expansion limitations of the ansoff matrix the limitation observed with the ansoff matrix is similar to those observed with the other tools the tool is not exhaustive enough to be used alone in coming to a marketing decision and as such for effective use it should be used with other tools such as swot analysis pest analysis etc  product portfolio analysis using the bcg matrix the boston consulting group bcg matrix is a portfolio management tool that helps companies group their products based on the market growth and market share matrix kotler et al as shown below   the matrix is divided into four segments namely stars these are products with high market share in a high growth market their growth rate is rapid and hence often requires a lot of investment if market share is retained they often grow into cash cows kotler et al  question marks these are products with low market share in a high growth market they are also referred to as problem children they usually require a lot of money to maintain or increase their market share a company usually has two options with such products invest a lot of money to grow them into stars or just phase out the product doyle  stern  cash cows these are products with high market share in a low growth market they usually require low investments to maintain their market shares and as such they usually generate the resources required to maintain other products that require a lot of investment kotler et al  doyle  stern  dogs these are products with low market share in a slow growth market and they are usually unprofitable doyle  stern  it is advisable to avoid or totally minimize the number of dogs in a companys portfolio  how apple inc could use the bcg to manage their product portfolio apple has a range of products the iphone family and the ipad will be analysed using the bcg matrix stars  iphone  ipad question marks  iphone gs ipod  cash cow figure  apple inc bcg matrix stars the iphone  is currently the star product of the company as it experiences high market share in a high growth market mobile hand set market the high market share it enjoys is largely due to the success of the previous models it is very likely that the iphone  will retain its market share for a while to come as there is currently no product in the market that combines all the features it has for the price it is available for another product of the apple inc that falls under this category is the ipad even though it was just introduced in april  it has enjoyed a passive sale of  million units already united states security and exchange commission  and the ipad accounted for  of the companys total net sales for  according to mintel reports it owns more than  of the tablet market which shows that it enjoys high market share in a high growth market question marks the iphonegs has lost a huge part of its market share to the iphone and as therefore become a question mark albeit in the early stages it will generate some cash for the company for a while to come mainly because of the reduction in its price however with the new iphone  it is unlikely to grow into a star again and it is advisable for the company to phase it out eventually cash cows the ipod is the companys major cash cow it has been around for a long time and enjoys huge market share the growth in the market has reduced with a lot of gadgets that combine mp players with their other features however it requires little or no further advertisement as people are aware of it and will continue to buy it for a while to come the resources generated from it can be used to fund other products in the portfolio advantages of the bcg matrix the major advantage of the bcg matrix is that it helps companies determine their position in a market relative to their competitors they can use the result from the analysis to determine what products to invest resources in and what products to phase out for instance knowing that the iphone gs has become a question mark will help the company focus more on the new iphone and reduce the production and advertisement costs that would have been incurred on the iphonegs also the revenue realised from their cash cow ipod can be channelled to other products in their portfolio limitations of the bcg matrix however there were some limitations observed with the tool the matrix views each product in a portfolio as independent from each other it is possible to have low market share in a high growth market question mark and still be profitable this is seen in the case of the iphone even though it has lost its market leader position it will serve more as a cash cow for the company for a while to come because it will continue to enjoy sales rather than instantly becoming a question mark the matrix judges the performance of products using only growth rate and market share this is not sufficient as there are a number of other factors that determine the success of a product in a market such as the marketing mix etc a major determinant in the case of apples iphone is the att customers are not happy with the quality of their network and even though apple is making profits on the phone they could be making more if they were with a more preferred network therefore the choice of network provider also impacts on the performance of their products conclusion the business environment has become highly competitive and it is imperative for any company entering the market to develop a strategic plan based on analysis of the market customer needs etc it is often a wise choice for an organization to have multiple growth strategies for their various products and product portfolios apple inc products and product portfolios have been analysed using the product lifecycle ansoff matrix and bcg matrix some advantages and limitations observed with the tools have been discussed and recommendations have been made in areas where there is still ample room for growth there is no standalone or all sufficient marketing tool and the full potential of a tool can only be realised when used with one or two other tools  the marketing game the marketing game was about four companies vying for the number one position in a market that showed excellent room for growth and profit word processing software the aim of the game was to be the company that made the most profit after  financial years as four companies were competing for the market shares and profits it was important for each company to understand the market the competitors and the market trends and use this understanding to come up with a strategy that will set them apart from the remaining three if they were to make profit and ultimately win the game wordsoft before any decision or strategy could be made it was important to understand the different market segments and their unique needs and these are summarized below the modern students this segment consists majorly of college students who are not keen on the technicalities of the software but on the price for this category economy is the most crucial factor the home scribblers this segment consists of a mix of households who use the software for various purposes this category of users prefers easy to use software and one which is not easily prone to errors they are also a pricesensitive segment the harried typists as frequent not necessarily expert users of the software members of this category want software that is easy to learn and use price is not a major factor for this category as they are usually not in the position to make purchasing decisions the professional writers as professionals in their field this segments primary concern is for software that can save them time and affords them special commands for advanced auditing and formatting capabilities the hightech managers members of this segment are interested in the latest software and the number of capabilities they offer they are motivated by social needs for status and esteem price is not of concern to this category of users the concerned parents this category of users wants easy to use software that children can learn themselves  year  in the first year wordsoft targeted the students and home scribblers and the product    was manufactured the ps of marketing price place promotion and product were employed in formulating the strategy for the first year emphasis was placed on channel two since it was the channel students frequented more and as such fifteen salesmen were deployed to this channel against the five deployed to channel one however the retail price was erroneously set at £ which was higher than that for channel one £ was spent on promotion and pioneering advertisement was used to raise general awareness about the software market the company did not fully utilize its budget and had money in excess at the end of the year  units were requested however only  units were sold out of the  units that were produced money was therefore lost on inventory transferred some of the decisions made paid off and wordsoft made a profit in excess of £ however this performance was dismal when compared to the performance of the other three companies and even though profit was made the year ended on a sour note  year  the performance from the first year was analysed alongside the market research report and some errors made in the first year were highlighted as follows promotion is key in marketing and the amount spent on advertisement was insufficient this affected the overall performance relative to the other companies sales performance was less than actual production hence the company lost money for inventory transferred the product was not achieving the desired result in the targeted segments and it was therefore important to reassess the various segments and manufacture a more needed product the price set for the channel two market was erroneously higher than that of channel one after careful analysis it was necessary to restrategise if wordsoft was to become a company to be reckoned with the first step was to reassess the marketing mix product price place and promotion and determine what market segment to target and generally try and improve on the performance of the previous year product it was obvious from the previous year performance that there was a need to manufacture a new product that will target a different segment of the market it was decided that the typists and managers should be targeted since they made up  of the market and the new product    was manufactured to suit their needs price the retail price was set at £ for channel one since the majority of the target market shopped there and £ for channel two to attract students home and parents even though the product was not produced to meet the specifications of the later group it was decided that they will compromise on product if the price was right place fifteen more salesmen were employed and they were deployed on a ratio  to channels one and two respectively promotion advertisement will help inform potential customers and there was a chance they will become customers therefore a loan of £ was taken from the bank and it was spent solely on advertisement indirect advertisement was employed the decisions made paid off and wordsoft made the most sales and performed well in more segments than anticipated it sold all the units produced and it became the market leader in four out of the six segments owning more than  of the market share and it doubled the profit made in the first year  year  by the third year the rudiments of the market had been understood and the decisions for the third year were easier to make slight modification was made to the product to be more suited to managers but not enough to deter the typists and writers from purchasing in addition the prices were increased slightly from that of the previous year thirteen more salesmen were employed and they were distributed evenly between the two channels to increase awareness for the product in both channels and their commission was increased to  which was more than the average been paid in the market the percentage nonselling time was set at  for channels one and two respectively thereby raising more awareness for the brand with personal marketing £ was spent on sales promotion and £ was spent on advertisement and direct advertisement was employed to reinforce wordsoft as a market leader the retail price was set at £ for channel one and £ for channel two at the end of the third year wordsoft made the most sales it also went on to become the market leader in all the six segments a feat that had not been achieved previously by any of the other companies it owned more that  of the overall market share and made profit in excess of £  year  by the fourth year wordsoft had been able to carve a niche for itself as a reputable and trusted brand the ease of learning was slightly increased and the product    was manufactured as a result of the volume of sales of the previous year it was imperative to employ more salesmen eight more salesmen were employed and they were shared at the ratio  to channels one and two respectively £ was spent on indirect advertisement and £ was spent on sales promotion wordsoft maintained its lead at the end of the third year selling more than  units it made profits of over £million and owned more than  of the market share  year  for the fifth year the price for the products was reduced to attract more consumers since the product has been in the market for a number of years and market research showed that it might be getting to its saturation stage in the product lifecycle the price was therefore set at £ and £ for channels one and two respectively £ was spent on advertisement and £ was spent on sales promotion the game ended on a very happy note for wordsoft and they totalled a cumulative profit of over £million and maintained the market leader position and market share of over  lessons learnt in retrospect the failure at the end of the first year was the launching pad for the success of wordsoft it was evident that they needed to reassess their strategy and determine whether it was strong enough to help them achieve their vision of being the market leader and the company with the most profit after the fifth financial year they realised the need to better understand the market the market research gave them the insight they needed to identify possible market opportunities and to focus their resources on it more money could have been spent on advertisement in the first year marketing is all about taking risks wordsoft was initially wary of taking loans but once it did that helped in focusing its resources on what was important and in this case advertisement the importance of market research cannot be over emphasized this was evident in the case of w p  they did not request for market research and were therefore unable to conduct a proper analysis of the market and know where to channel their resources this resulted in their loss in the game finally having the most market share does not usually translate into making the most profit and when it comes to marketing cheaper is not always better the decision that had the most impact on the outcome the decision that had the most impact was the decision to target typists and managers but at the same time making the price cheap enough for students home and parents to be able to afford this decision was responsible principally for the success of wordsoft throughout the years another critical decision was the choice to invest a lot of money in advertisement and sales promotion emphasis was also laid on salesmen and the wordsoft paid more than the average commission rate in the market throughout the five years under analysis a combination of these decisions was responsible for the success of wordsoft request removal if you are the original writer of this essay and no longer wish to have the essay published on the uk essays

marketing the boston matrix a business with a range of products has a portfolio of products however owning a product portfolio poses a problem for a business it must decide how to allocate investment eg in product development promotion across the portfolio what is the boston matrix a portfolio of products can be analysed using the boston group consulting matrix this categorises the products into one of four different areas based on market share – does the product being sold have a low or high market sharemarket growth – are the numbers of potential customers in the market growing or nothow the boston matrix is constructed the boston matrix makes a series of key assumptions market share can be gained by investment in marketingmarket share gains will always generate cash surplusescash surpluses will be generated when the product is in the maturity stage of the life cyclethe best opportunity to build a dominant market position is during the growth phasehow does the boston matrix work the four categories can be described as follows stars are high growth products competing in markets where they are strong compared with the competition often stars need heavy investment to sustain growth eventually growth will slow and assuming they keep their market share stars will become cash cowscash cows are lowgrowth products with a high market share these are mature successful products with relatively little need for investment they need to be managed for continued profit  so that they continue to generate the strong cash flows that the company needs for its starsquestion marks are products with low market share operating in high growth markets this suggests that they have potential but may need substantial investment to grow market share at the expense of larger competitors management have to think hard about “question marks  which ones should they invest in which ones should they allow to fail or shrinkunsurprisingly the term “dogs refers to products that have a low market share in unattractive lowgrowth markets dogs may generate enough cash to breakeven but they are rarely if ever worth investing in dogs are usually sold or closedideally a business would prefer products in all categories apart from dogs to give it a balanced portfolio of products the main values of using the boston matrix include a useful tool for analysing product portfolio decisionsbut it is only a snapshot of the current positionhas little or no predictive valuedoes not take account of environmental factorsthere are flaws which flow from the assumptions on which the matrix is basedhowever the model can be criticised in several ways market growth is an inadequate measure of a markets attractivenessmarket share is an adequate measure of a products ability to generate cashthe focus on market share and market growth ignores issues such as developing a sustainable competitiveadvantagesthe product life cycle varies if you would like to learn more about this

team james manktelow elizabeth eyre keith jackson liz cook steven edwards lucy bishop ed pearcey ian moss   ratings decision matrix analysis making a decision by weighing up different factors also known as grid analysis pugh matrix analysis and multiattribute utility theory   imagine that your boss has put you in charge of taking on a new outsourced it supplier youve already identified several different suppliers and you now need to decide which one to use you could decide to go with the lowcost option but you dont want to make your decision on cost alone – factors such as contract length underlying technology and service levels need to be taken into consideration so how can you make sure you make the best decision while taking all of these different factors into account decision matrix analysis is a useful technique to use for making a decision its particularly powerful where you have a number of good alternatives to choose from and many different factors to take into account this makes it a great technique to use in almost any important decision where there isnt a clear and obvious preferred option being able to use decision matrix analysis means that you can take decisions confidently and rationally at a time when other people might be struggling to make a decision  watch this video to discover how you can use the decision matrix analysis to make better decisions how to use the tool decision matrix analysis works by getting you to list your options as rows on a table and the factors you need consider as columns you then score each optionfactor combination weight this score by the relative importance of the factor and add these scores up to give an overall score for each option while this sounds complex this technique is actually quite easy to use heres a stepbystep guide with an example start by downloading our free worksheet then work through these steps step  list all of your options as the row labels on the table and list the factors that you need to consider as the column headings for example if you were buying a new laptop factors to consider might be cost dimensions and hard disk size step  next work your way down the columns of your table scoring each option for each of the factors in your decision score each option from  poor to  very good note that you do not have to have a different score for each option – if none of them are good for a particular factor in your decision then all options should score  step  the next step is to work out the relative importance of the factors in your decision show these as numbers from say  to  where  means that the factor is absolutely unimportant in the final decision and  means that it is very important its perfectly acceptable to have factors with the same importance tip these values may be obvious if they are not then use a technique such as paired comparison analysis to estimate them step  now multiply each of your scores from step  by the values for relative importance of the factor that you calculated in step  this will give you weighted scores for each optionfactor combination step  finally add up these weighted scores for each of your options the option that scores the highest wins tip if your intuition tells you that the top scoring option isn’t the best one then reflect on the scores and weightings that you’ve applied this may be a sign that certain factors are more important to you than you initially thought also if an option scores very poorly for a factor decide whether this rules it out altogether example a caterer needs to find a new supplier for his basic ingredients he has four options finding this article useful you can learn another  decisionmaking skills like this by joining the mind tools club join the mind tools club today

location reliability payment options firstly he draws up the table shown in figure  and scores each option by how well it satisfies each factor figure  example decision matrix analysis showing unweighted assessment of how each supplier satisfies each factor factors cost quality location reliability payment options total weights             supplier         supplier         supplier         supplier         next he decides the relative weights for each of the factors he multiplies these by the scores already entered and totals them this is shown in figure  figure  example decision matrix analysis showing weighted assessment of how each supplier satisfies each factor factors cost quality location reliability payment options total weights        supplier        supplier        supplier        supplier        this makes it clear to the caterer that supplier  is the best option despite the lack of flexibility of its payment options key points decision matrix analysis helps you to decide between several options where you need to take many different factors into account to use the tool lay out your options as rows on a table set up the columns to show the factors you need to consider score each choice for each factor using numbers from  poor to  very good and then allocate weights to show the importance of each of these factors multiply each score by the weight of the factor to show its contribution to the overall selection finally add up the total scores for each option the highest scoring option will be the best option note decision matrix analysis is the simplest form of multiple criteria decision analysis mcda also known as multiple criteria decision aid or multiple criteria decision management mcdm sophisticated mcda can involve highly complex modelling of different potential scenarios using advanced mathematics a lot of business decision making however is based on approximate or subjective data where this is the case decision matrix analysis may be all that’s needed download worksheet this site teaches you the skills you need for a happy and successful career and this is just one of many tools and resources that youll find here
