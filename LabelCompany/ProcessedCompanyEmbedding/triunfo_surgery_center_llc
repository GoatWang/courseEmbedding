consumeraffairs research team believes everyone deserves to make smart decisions we aim to provide readers with the most uptodate information available about todays consumer products and serviceswhat features matter most top cost of lasikhealth insurance typically does not cover lasik surgery making it a fairly expensive outofpocket expense before deciding on a particular provider be sure to find out all the pricing detailsfind the hidden fees when getting a price quote one of the most common issues is a double bill keep in mind most providers quote the cost of a single eye don’t be surprised if the total cost is twice the original quote forget about discount service while many providers advertise deep discounts on lasik surgery there are a couple of issues with actually getting that price first of all most people will not qualify for the deep discount those with astigmatism or who are farsighted rarely enjoy discount pricing of course with vision at stake deep discounts don’t always inspire confidence what are you buying the type of surgery also plays an important role in pricing laser based procedures are the most expensive followed closely by wavefront lasik with femtosecond laser flap lasik with a bladed microkeratome is the least expensive option but it may not be available for all candidates types of surgerythere are more than ten different types of laser vision correction and lasik is only one of them different types of laser surgery work best with different visual issues though lasik is the most commonwhat are the top three recommended surgeries lasik tops the list but some facilities might also recommend prk or lasek both of these alternatives use laser surgery to correct mild to moderate nearsightedness farsightedness andor astigmatism why choose laser there are other types of surgery that do not use laser vision correction they might include a small incision to insert an implant or replace a lens unless needed these surgeries tend to have longer recovery times and a higher incidence of complications what makes laser the best option advances in laser technology allow surgeons to map the procedure ahead of time and operate with pinpoint precision most procedures are outpatient so patients leave the same day determining eligibilitybefore going through any of the other challenges related to lasik be sure to find out about eligibility those with extreme nearsightedness substantial astigmatism dry eyes and a variety of other corneal diseases and eye conditions can affect eligibilityeligible prescriptions if every prescription requires a different level of corrective lenses lasik is probably not a good idea in order to be eligible a patient needs to have a stable prescription for at least two years nearsighted vs farsighted which one is better for lasik lasik can correct both nearsighted and farsighted visual issues but it may not be ideal for every situation extreme issues on either side may result in a variety of issues including the need for refinements or repeat procedures is lasik best for astigmatism lasik can correct astigmatism but there may be instances where an implant or alternative laser surgery will offer better results be sure to discuss all of the options with a surgeon before settling on lasik choosing a surgeonwhoever performs the procedure can be as important as the type of procedure chosen to address specific visual acuity issues when choosing a surgeon be sure to find one with a good bedside manner ease when answering questions and extensive experience in their fieldgetting comfortable with a doctor before trusting a doctor many patients need to meet with them several times after all there is no such thing as minor eye surgery a small mistake could leave a patient paying in lost vision forever a good bedside manner can help the patient relax and experience the most trouble free recovery possible easy answers for difficult questions when a surgeon offers cookie cutter answers that don’t really address underlying concerns they may not be the right doctor after all sometimes the news isn’t great and they need to offer bad news when that happens patients want clear and concise information that gets to the heart of the issues look for experience with a new procedure patients might be interested in going with a new doctor but nothing is a substitute for experience when choosing a surgeon be sure to look for someone who has performed thousands of successful procedures financing optionspaying for lasik can be challenging as procedures start in the low  range and extend upwards depending on the severity of the visual issues if refinements are needed the price will continue to skyrocket this leaves patients struggling to put together enough money to cover the outofpocket costswhat about insurance most insurance companies cover glasses or contact lenses but not lasik surgery be sure to seek preauthorization and find out what – if any – contribution the insurance company will make do they offer financing many surgical centers offering laser vision correction offer financing options depending on the patients credit history they may require a substantial down payment though so be sure to get all the details before the day of scheduled surgery what about refinements who pays if the first procedure doesn’t offer complete results the best facilities pay at least a portion of the cost involved in any refinement procedures depending on the original projected results recovery processwithout proper postsurgical care patients could leave with vision that is worse than when they started putting in eyedrops resting eyes for recommended time frames and making followup visits can be the difference between success and failureputting in eye drops eye drops are a part of the routine care following lasik putting them in without help can be difficult be sure to line up assistance with some of these tasks before scheduling surgery take some time off work recovery times can vary depending on the procedure even when a doctor clears a patient for immediate return to work staring at a computer screen for hours each day may not be the best way to recover from eye surgery make the followups before leaving after surgery set up all followup appointments and be sure ask about warning signs for which you should make emergency visits scheduling transportation in advance can help ensure that patients miss no appointments what are different types of lasik top lasiktraditional lasik uses a laser and sometimes a blade to reshape the
