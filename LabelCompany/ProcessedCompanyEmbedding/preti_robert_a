considerations for neostem’s acquisition of california stem cell  the chairmans blog log in connect with create your account login with your account remember me forgot your password manufacturing considerations for neostem’s acquisition of california stem cell posted on may st    by robert preti facebook linkedin twitter google email article your email address is not valid from to you have successfully emailed the post recently neostem made the very exciting announcement that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire california stem cell inc “csc” and with it its innovative cancer immunotherapy melapuldencelt  this acquisition is significant to the company for a number of reasons but as the chief scientific officer of neostem and the president of progenitor cell therapy “pct” i am personally excited to tell you how i see great synergy between this acquisition and our own manufacturing capabilities first a bit about me i have served on the stem cell banking committee and cord blood subcommittee of the new york state department of health and on the new jersey state department of health’s blood bank advisory committee chairing the hematopoietic progenitor cell processing subcommittee in addition i have served in a leadership capacity for many professional organizations including treasurer and founding member of the international society of hematotherapy and graft engineering now called isct international society for cellular therapy i recently completed a five year term as a director for aabb and am currently an executive committee member for the alliance for regenerative medicine arm where among other activities i cochair the standards and technology committee pct which i cofounded more than a decade ago was originally built in response to a recognized need for high quality manufacturing and development services in an emerging industry as the cell therapy field has grown so too has pct— the company has now served over  clients and performed more than  cell therapy procedures  since pct was acquired by neostem in  we have found unique synergies and efficiencies in being a single company paving the way in this industry as with the acquisition of pct neostem believes in seeking growth by way of strategic procurement and we have continued to remain opportunistic as the field matures and consolidation presents opportunities for those like us with the specialized knowledge base and expertise associated with this industry as part of our due diligence for this transaction the neostem team including representatives from our scientific technical manufacturing and quality teams evaluated  csc’s entire manufacturing process as it has been developed over the years  we studied both the current and previous processes for generation of dctc autologous dendritic cells pulsed with irradiated tumor cells and have satisfied ourselves that improvements to the manufacturing process for the generation of the patientspecific cancer initiating cells used to load the dendritic cells and direct the immunotherapy towards the patients’ cells expressing that unique antigen profile both reduced the time to manufacture the cell line and significantly improved the success rate to generate the tc line for patients enrolled in the trial   csc scientists and product development personnel recognized a few years ago the need to improve on the success rate of tc line generation and we were pleased to conclude that  they have  overcome this limitation through enhancements in the tumor cell collection and handling the transport media and adaptations in the manufacturing process itself through the use of microsphere formation ahead of cell line expansion  importantly fda has agreed that these changes have been implemented in a way that  maintains comparability between the previous process and the current process our diligence convinced me that csc’s products and processes are a natural fit with neostem’s unique clinical regulatory and manufacturing expertise  here are just some of the reasons using pct’s inhouse manufacturing services for melapuldencelt allows for efficient and cost effective manufacturing at all stages of development including for this late stage product candidate pct’s engineering  innovation center focusing on automation and cost reduction strategies is expected to be valuable to advancing melapuldencelt through its phase  clinical trial and beyond in a way that results in high product quality with a reasonable cost of goods over the commercial life of the product pct’s expertise will be invaluable as we have helped many clients in their development for immunotherapy products including provenge for which pct performed the manufacturing process during the development process through bla submission pct has in place the additional capabilities csc will need for robust product manufacturing and logistics for a multicenter phase  trial and cost effective production for commercial sales if the csc product is approved additionally neostem can leverage csc’s expertise in immunotherapy and the capacity in irvine both infrastructural and human to do additional manufacturing andor development work to advance csc’s neostem’s once the acquisition is complete platform technology as well as those of pct’s client base i am excited to welcome csc’s management and staff into our

cirm californias stem cell agency robert preti stem cell and gene therapy research gets a good report card from industry leader january    kevin mccormack  leave a comment panel discussion at arm state of the industry briefing left to right robert preti chair arm jeff walsh bluebird bio manfred rudiger kiadis pharma barbara sasu pfizer  thomas farrell bellicum pharmaceuticals photo courtesy arm the state of the regenerative medicine field is strong and getting stronger that was the bottom line verdict at the  cell and gene therapies state of the industry briefing in san francisco the briefing an annual update on the field presented by the alliance for regenerative medicine arm gave a “by the numbers” look at the field and apart from one negative spot everything is moving in the right direction robert preti chair of arm’s board said worldwide there are more than  regenerative companies working in the stem cell and gene therapy space and those companies are increasingly moving the research out of the lab and into clinical trials in people for example at the end of 6 there were  clinical trials underway that is a  percent growth over  those breakdown as follows phase  –  compared to  in  phase  – 6 compared to 6 in  phase  –  compared to 6 in  the bulk of these clinical trials  percent are focused on cancer the second largest target  percent is on heart disease the number of trials for neurological disorders and rare diseases are also growing in number preti says the industry is at an important inflection point right now and that this growth is presenting new problems “the pipeline of products is robust and the technologies supporting that pipeline is even more robust the technologies that are fueling the growth in clinical activity have accelerated so fast that we on the manufacturing side are playing catchup we are at a point where we have to get serious about large scale commercial production” preti also talked about “harmonization” of the regulatory process and the need to have a system that makes it easier for products approved for clinical trials in one country to get approval for clinical trials in other countries michael werner the executive director of arm said the organization has played a key role in helping promote the field and cited the recently passed st century cures act as “a major win and a powerful statement of arm’s leadership in this sector” but there was one area where the news wasn’t all positive the ability of companies to raise capital in  companies raised  billion for research in 6 it was less than half of that  billion with that somber note in mind it was appropriate that the panel discussion that followed the briefing was focused on the nearterm and longterm challenges facing the field if it was to be commercially successful one of the big challenges was the issue of regulatory approval and here the panel seemed to be more optimistic than in previous years manfred rüdiger of kiadis pharma said he was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to work with different regulatory agencies in the us canada and europe “we used them as a kind of free consultancy service listening to their advice and making the changes they suggested so that we were able to use the same manufacturing process in europe and canada and the us” jeff walsh of bluebird bio said the key to having a good working relationship with regulatory agencies like the food and drug administration fda is simple “trust and transparency between you and the regulatory agencies is essential it’s a critical factor in advancing your work the agencies respond well when you have that trust one thing we can’t be is afraid to ask the agencies will tell you where their line is but don’t be afraid to ask or to push the boundaries this is new for everyone companies and regulators so if you are pushing it helps create the environment that allows you to work together to develop safe therapies that benefit patients” another big issue was scalability in manufacturing that it’s one thing to produce enough of a product to carry out a clinical trial but completely different if you are hoping to use that same product to treat millions of people spread out all over the us or the world and of course cost is always something that is front and center in people’s minds how do you develop therapies that are not just safe and effective but also affordable how do companies ensure they will get reimbursed by health insurers for the treatments no one had any simple answer to what are clearly very complex problems but all recognized the need to start thinking about these now long before the treatments themselves are even ready walsh ended by saying “this is not just about what can you charge but what should you charge we have a responsibility to engage with the agencies and ultimately the payers that make these decisions in the same way we engage with regulatory agencies with a sense of openness trust and transparency too often companies wait too long too late before turning to the payers and trying to decide what is appropriate to charge”     share thistwitterfacebooklinkedinemaillike thislike loading
