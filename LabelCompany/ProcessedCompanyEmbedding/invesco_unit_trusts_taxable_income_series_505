portfolio important information the value of investments and any income will fluctuate this may partly be the result of exchange rate fluctuations and investors may not get back the full amount invested when making an investment in an investment trust or investment company you are buying shares in a company that is listed on a stock exchange the price of the shares will be determined by supply and demand consequently the share price of an investment trust or investment company may be higher or lower than the underlying net asset value of the investments in its portfolio and there can be no certainty that there will be liquidity in the shares current tax levels and reliefs may change depending on individual circumstances this may affect investment returns where invesco perpetual has expressed views and opinions these may change the investment trusts and investment companies may use borrowings to invest in the market the use of borrowings may enhance total return when the value of the investment trusts’ and investment companies’ assets are rising but it will have the opposite effect when asset values fall the use of borrowings may increase the volatility of the share price and the net asset value per share in certain circumstances the investment trusts and investment companies may be required to repay borrowings and this could adversely affect income and capital returns the edinburgh investment trust plc invesco asia trust plc invesco perpetual uk smaller companies investment trust plc keystone investment trust plc and perpetual income and growth investment

smaller companies investment trust investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate the city merchants high yield trust limited and invesco perpetual enhanced income limited have a significant proportion of highyielding bonds which means that there is more risk to investors’ capital and income than from a company investing in government or investment grade bonds income from the investment may fluctuate and is not guaranteed the companies may invest in derivatives this means that the net asset value of the

to commodities which are generally considered to be high risk investments and may result in large fluctuations in the value of the investment trust the directors intend that each portfolio will effectively operate as if it were a standalone company however prospective investors should be aware that in the event that any of the portfolios have insufficient funds or assets to meet all of its liabilities such a shortfall would become a liability of the other portfolios in addition should the investment trust incur material liabilities in the future a significant fall in the value of the investment trust’s assets as a whole may affect the investment trust’s ability to pay dividends on a particular class of shares even though there are distributable profits attributable to the relevant portfolio the investment trust may use borrowings to invest in the market the use of borrowings may enhance total return when the value of the investment trust’s assets is rising but it will have the opposite effect when asset values fall the use of borrowings may increase the volatility of the share price and the net asset value per share in certain circumstances the investment trust may be required to repay borrowings and this could adversely affect income and capital returns the investment trust expects to increase dividend payments on the global equity income and uk equity shares by
