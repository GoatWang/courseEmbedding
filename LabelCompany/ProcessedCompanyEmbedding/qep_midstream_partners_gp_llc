in this quarterly report on form q please refer to the glossary of terms provided in the partnerships  annual report on form k overview qep midstream the partnership is a master limited partnership formed to own operate acquire and develop midstream energy assets on july   the partnership acquired  of the membership interests in green river processing llc green river processing from qep field services company qepfsc for  million the green river processing acquisition the green river processing acquisition was funded with  million of borrowings under the partnerships  million revolving credit facility the prior credit facility and cash on hand on december   qep resources midstream business was acquired by tllp which included all of the issued and outstanding membership interest of qep field services llc qepfs a whollyowned subsidiary of qepfsc formed for purposes of consummating the qep field services acquisition qepfs is the owner of qep midstream partners gp llc our general partner which owns a  general partner interest in qep midstream and all of the partnerships incentive distribution rights the acquisition also included an approximate  limited partner interest in the partnership collectively the acquisition prior to the acquisition qepfsc owned and operated qep midstreams general partner this resulted in a change of control of the partnerships general partner and the partnership became a consolidated subsidiary of tllp on the acquisition date prior to this transaction qep resources through its whollyowned subsidiary qepfsc served as the partnerships general partner and owned a  general partner interest all of the partnerships incentive distribution rights and an approximate  limited partner interest in the partnership the partnerships assets consist of ownership interests in four gathering systems and two federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulated pipelines through which we provide natural gas and crude oil gathering and transportation services additionally we have a  interest in two gas processing complexes through the green river processing acquisition our assets are located in or are within close proximity to the green river basin located in wyoming and colorado the uinta basin located in eastern utah and the williston basin located in north dakota recent developments on april   the partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution totaling  million or  per unit for the first quarter of  the quarterly distribution will be paid on may   to unitholders of record as of the close of business on may   on april   qep midstream entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with tllp tesoro logistics gp llc tlgp qepfs tllp merger sub llc merger sub and our general partner subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions in the merger agreement upon the later of the filing with the secretary of state of the state of delaware of a certificate of merger or the later date and time set forth in such certificate merger sub will merge with and into qep midstream with qep midstream surviving the merger as a whollyowned subsidiary of tllp the merger following the merger our general partner will remain the general partner of qep midstream and all outstanding common units representing limited partnership interests in qep midstream the qep midstream common units other than qep midstream common units held by qepfs will be converted into the right to receive  common units representing limited partnership interests in tllp the tllp common units no fractional tllp common units will be issued in the merger and holders of qep midstream common units other than qepfs will instead receive cash in lieu of fractional tllp common units if any in the regions where we operate several producers have announced lower drilling expenditures for  our  capital plan primarily includes compression projects which we expect will generate incremental volumes independent of drilling plans our operations our results are driven primarily by the volumes of natural gas and crude oil we gather and the fees charged for such services we connect wells to gathering lines through which crude oil may be delivered to a downstream pipeline and ultimately to endusers and natural gas may be delivered to a processing plant treating facility or downstream pipeline and ultimately to endusers we generally do not take title to the natural gas and crude oil that we gather or transport we provide substantially all of our gathering services pursuant to feebased agreements the majority of which have annual inflation adjustment mechanisms under these arrangements we are paid a fixed or marginbased fee with respect to the volume of the natural gas and crude oil we gather this type of contract provides us with a relatively steady revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk except to the extent that we retain and sell condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas from the wellhead approximately  of our partnerships revenue was generated through the sale of condensate volumes that we collected on our gathering systems during three months ended march   although the partnership has entered into a fixed price condensate sales agreement with qepfs we still have indirect exposure to commodity price risk in that persistent low commodity prices may cause our current or potential customers to delay drilling or shut in production which would reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas available for gathering by our systems refer to the commodity price risk discussion in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item  for a discussion of our exposure to commodity price risk through our condensate recovery and sales with the green river processing acquisition our activities have expanded to include the processing of natural gas to separate ngl from the natural gas fractionating the resulting ngl into the various components and selling or delivering pipeline quality natural gas and ngl to various industrial and energy markets as well as interstate pipeline systems our earnings from our investment in green river processing are primarily driven by commodity prices for ngl and natural gas as well as the volumes of natural gas processed under feebased agreements effective december   following the completion of the acquisition green river processing entered into the keepwhole commodity fee agreement the keepwhole commodity agreement with tesoro refining  marketing company llc trmc a whollyowned subsidiary of tesoro corporation tesoro to minimize and mitigate commodity price risk see note  of our annual report on form k for the year ended december   for additional information regarding related party agreements we have significant acreage dedications from several of our largest customers pursuant to the terms of those agreements our customers have dedicated all of the oil and natural gas production they own or control from i wells that are currently connected to our gathering systems and located within the acreage dedication and ii future wells that are drilled during the term of the applicable gathering contract and located within the dedicated acreage as our gathering systems currently exist and as they are expanded to connect to additional wells we provide a portion of our gathering and transportation services on our three rivers and williston gathering systems through firm contracts with minimum volume commitments which are designed to ensure that we will generate a certain amount of revenue over the life of the gathering agreement by collecting either gathering fees for actual throughput or payments to cover any shortfall how we evaluate our business our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance including throughput volumes gathering expenses maintenance and growth capital expenditures adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow both adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are nongaap financial measures definitions of these nongaap financial measures are discussed below throughput volumes the amount of revenue we generate depends primarily on the volumes of natural gas and crude oil that we gather for our customers the volumes transported on our gathering pipelines are driven by upstream development drilling activity and production volumes from the wells connected to our gathering pipelines gathering expenses we seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing to the extent appropriate expenses directly tied to operating and maintaining our assets direct labor costs compression costs ad valorem and property taxes repair and maintenance costs integrity management costs utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operations and maintenance expense these expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of these expenses maintenance and growth capital expenditures we define maintenance capital expenditures as those that will enable us to maintain our operating capacity or operating income over the long term and growth capital expenditures as those that we expect will increase our operating capacity or operating income over the long term we schedule our ongoing routine operating and maintenance capital expenditures on our gathering systems throughout the calendar year to avoid significant variability in our cash flows and maintain safe operations there is typically some seasonality in our expenditures as we generally reduce routine maintenance in the winter months due to weather conditions we actively seek new opportunities to add throughput to our systems by expanding the geographic areas covered by our gathering systems connecting new wells to the systems and installing additional compression we analyze the expected return on growth capital expenditures and attempt to negotiate terms in our agreements that ensure we will receive an acceptable rate of return on those expenditures adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow nongaap we define adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to the partnership before depreciation and amortization interest and other income and expense gains and losses from asset sales deferred revenue associated with minimum volume commitment payments and certain other noncash andor nonrecurring items we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda less net cash interest paid maintenance capital expenditures and cash adjustments related to equity method investments and noncontrolling interests and other noncash expenses distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are nongaap financial measures used by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors and commercial banks to assess our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities general trends and outlook we expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect our actual results may vary materially from our expected results oil and natural gas supply and demand our gathering operations are primarily dependent upon natural gas and crude oil production in our areas of operation the decline in natural gas prices over the prior years has caused a related decrease in natural gas drilling in the united states in addition there is a natural decline in production from existing wells that are connected to our gathering systems we anticipate the current level of exploration and production activities in all of the areas in which we operate to fluctuate although we have no control over this activity fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices could affect production rates over time and levels of investment by third parties in exploration for and development of new natural gas and crude oil reserves commodity price risk future exposure to changes in natural gas and ngl prices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as changes in prices will impact our production levels and gathering volumes on december   following the completion of the acquisition green river processing entered into the keepwhole commodity agreement with trmc to minimize and mitigate commodity price risk however it is renewed annually which is subject to renegotiation of terms and pricing each year for the ngls that we handle under keepwhole agreements the partnership has a feebased processing agreement with tesoro which minimizes the impact of commodity price movement during the annual period subsequent to renegotiation of terms and pricing each year see note  of our annual report on form k for the year ended december   for additional information regarding related party agreements the regulation of natural gas and crude oil transportation activities by the ferc and other federal and state regulatory agencies including the department of transportation the dot has a significant impact on our business for example the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration office of the dot has established pipeline integrity management programs that require more frequent inspections of pipeline facilities and other preventative measures which may increase our compliance costs and increase the time it takes to obtain required permits ferc regulatory policies govern the rates that each pipeline is permitted to charge customers for interstate transportation of natural gas and crude oil our operations are also impacted by new regulations which have increased the time that it takes to obtain required permits additionally increased regulation of natural gas and crude oil producers in our areas of operations including regulation associated with hydraulic fracturing could reduce regional supply of natural gas and crude oil and therefore throughput on our gathering systems factors affecting the comparability of our financial results investment in green river processing on july   the partnership acquired  of the membership interests in green river processing from qepfsc for  million green river processing owns the blacks fork processing complex and the emigrant trail processing plant both of which are located in southwest wyoming the green river processing acquisition is accounted for as an equity method investment in an unconsolidated affiliate for the three months ended march   green river processing net

revenue increased  million or  to  million for the  quarter compared to  million for the  quarter during the  quarter there was throughput of  million mmbtu and an average gas gathering and transportation fee of  per mmbtu the majority of the natural gas throughput was attributable to our green river gathering system and our vermillion gathering system which contributed  mmbtu of

 million or  to  million during the  quarter compared to  million for the  quarter the average gathering fee for crude oil and condensate decreased by  per barrel during the  quarter as compared to

  and  million of income from our  interest in three rivers gathering during the  quarter all of the income from unconsolidated affiliates was from our interest in three rivers gathering adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow nongaap we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow provides information useful to investors in assessing our results of operations the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are net income attributable to the partnership and net cash provided by operating activities adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to the partnership net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow exclude some but not all items that affect net income attributable to the partnership and net cash provided by operating activities and these measures may vary among other companies as a result adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies reconciliation of net income attributable to qep midstream to adjusted ebitda and distributable may   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch

engage in transactions with and perform services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business the oil and natural gas gathering business is very competitive our competitors include other midstream companies producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines competition for oil and natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation commercial terms reliability service levels flexibility access to markets location available capacity capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies our principal competitors are enterprise products partners lp western gas and the williams companies inc in addition to competing for oil and natural gas volumes we face competition for customer markets which is primarily based on the proximity of pipelines to the markets price and assurance of supply as a result of our contractual relationship with qep under our gathering agreements we believe that our gathering systems and other midstream assets will not face significant competition from other pipelines for qep’s crude oil natural gas or products transportation requirements  under our partnership agreement qep and its affiliates are expressly permitted to compete with us qep and any of its affiliates may acquire construct or dispose of additional gathering systems or other midstream assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct those assets company description we are a limited partnership recently formed by qep resources inc nyse qep to own operate acquire and develop midstream energy assets our primary assets consist of ownership interests in four gathering systems and two fercregulated pipelines through which we provide natural gas and crude oil gathering and transportation services our assets are located in or are within close proximity to the green river basin located in wyoming and colorado the uinta basin located in eastern utah and the portion of the williston basin located in north dakota as of and for the three months ended march   our gathering systems had  miles of pipeline and an average gross throughput of  million mmbtud of natural gas and  bblsd of crude oil we believe our customers are some of the largest natural gas producers in the rocky mountain region including qep anadarko petroleum corporation anadarko eog resources inc eog questar corporation questar and ultra resources inc ultra we provide all of our gathering services through feebased agreements the majority of which have annual inflation adjustment mechanisms for the three months ended march   approximately  of our revenues were generated pursuant to contracts with remaining terms in excess of seven years including  of our revenues that were generated pursuant to “lifeofreserves” contracts in addition to our feebased gathering services for the three months ended march   approximately  of our revenue was generated through the sale of condensate volumes that we collect on our gathering systems for the three months ended march   approximately  of our natural gas gathering volumes and approximately  of our crude oil volumes were comprised of production owned by qep making qep our largest customer we have secured significant acreage dedications from several of our largest customers including qep we believe that drilling activity on acreage dedicated to us should maintain or increase our existing throughput levels and offset the natural production declines of the wells currently connected to our gathering systems pursuant to the terms of those agreements our customers have dedicated all of the oil and natural gas production they own or control from i wells that are currently connected to our gathering systems and located within the acreage dedication and ii future wells that are drilled during the term of the applicable gathering contract and located within the dedicated acreage as our gathering systems currently exist and as they are expanded to connect to additional wells we
