investors edge summaryardmore shipping offers a very attractive entry point for anyone desiring exposure to the product and chemical tanker marketsasc is much smaller in scale than rival scorpio tankers but also has a stronger balance sheet and less conflicts of interestthe company is currently capable of internal cash yields of up to   a fact easily overlooked due to rapid fleet expansionthe dividend of c only represents a current payout of   i expect to see an increase by hinvestors desiring exposure to this market should consider asc  upside is feasible if market conditions holdnote value investors edge subscribers had an early look at this article background ardmore shipping nyseasc was established in  to pursue growth with a modern product and chemical tanker fleet the company is headquartered in ireland but incorporated in the marshall islands and flags all of its vessels in the marshall islands to further reduce tax liabilities unlike many of its counterparts in the shipping industry ardmore is a product of private investment via greenbriar equity group and doesnt have the familial ties which are common in greek shipping companies this structure appears to reduce the relatedparty conflicts of interests which are common in this industry and makes ardmore a more investible vehicle than scorpio tankers nysestng which has a few questionable relatedparty structures public company history ardmore went public august st  at  per share well below the expected range of  when asc went public my view was that it was an alsoran to the already rolling scorpio tankers  my view can be seen below from stocktalks and twitter since ipo asc has paid out c in dividends for a month return of  scorpio tankers opened at  on august st and paid out c in dividends for a month return of  neither has done well but it seems i made the initial call correctly  but what about now ardmore and scorpio tankers have both been savvy managers of their equity but the latter has been much more aggressive by trading vessel orders and repurchasing during dips and recently raising new equity ardmore has been more slow and steady which is probably a better longterm way to approach this market ardmore did institute a m share repurchase program in november  since then it repurchased m in q but nothing in q judging by these actions management views the equity as fairly valued in the  range fleet specifics ardmore has a  vessel fleet fully delivered with an average age of  years and total dwt of  compare this to stng which boasts a fleet of over  million dwt however based on current market capitalization it trades for a similar valuation scorpio tankers is more leveraged hence the need for a recent share offering to support continued expansion earnings power the below chart highlights the results for q reported on may th the most impressive facet is that asc operated this quarter with only  vessels with a fully expanded fleet and current market rates we can safely assume at least a  jump in both net income and cash profits likely slightly more due to the scale of overhead see the below chart from ardmores recent q presentation to see the evidence of reduced overhead when the fleet size increases in shipping companies operating cash flow or simplified cash profits is a better way to look at sustainability and profitability depreciation  amortization are certainly real expenses but an investor is buying these types of entities for the stream of cash flows obviously depreciation is a critical expense when considering eventual fleet renewal in the case of asc necessary renewal is  years out and is virtually irrelevant from a discounted cash flow perspective take these earnings add  and you have an entity spinning off nearly  in cash flow  roughly a  internal yield to the current share price of  at these current rates and share prices asc is better off building scale while paying a token dividend of c per quarter but if rates stay relatively strong i would expect an increase in the dividend to at least c prior to fall  if ardmore pays out  of its future cash profit approx c quarterly and can secure  debt financing for newbuilds it can grow the fleet by  vessels per year without tapping the equity markets if asc continues to pay c it can grow the fleet by up to  vessels per year assuming yard pricing remains cheap market prospects shipping is a violently cyclical market as seen by the devastation in the public markets despite a recent uptick in rates for crude product and chemical tankers the broad investment market remains skeptical  as clearly seen by the poor performance of both stng and asc stocks the following metrics are taken from ardmores q presentation from  weeks ago the global fleet continues to grow but the order book is beginning to decline again the high rate of global supply makes me nervous especially compared to the flat fleet levels from  shipping companies arent as bearish as they were in  but levels are close the time to invest in these types of ventures is when everyone is running for the hills its rather surprising that nobody heard the music ending back in  with that shocking order book rate the chemical order book is similar albeit with an even more shocking peak in  the order book is picking back up which is a bearish indicator but global fleet supply has been practically flat since  a reuters article from november  calls for a strong bullish turn in the chemical tanker market fundamentally speaking an increase in global chemical trade makes sense and the current levels look encouraging especially considering ardmores stock is still lagging although up  since the reuters article arguably a lot of this increase is also due to ardmores stellar q performance spurred by strong operational efficiencies and strong product tanker spot trades below conclusion ardmore is very attractively priced if you believe the future is bright for the product and chemical tanker market i still personally favor stng due to the more aggressive nature of management but the handling of the latest public offering makes me question its foresight a bit ardmore is capable of internal cash yields exceeding  perhaps even higher if the market rates improve further i am skeptical of the longevity of product rates but i see a strong setup in the chemical sector many of ardmores vessels are dual purpose so this will provide more flexibility in case the markets head in different directions i dont currently own any ardmore shares but i might add some in the next few days to further diversify my stng holdings by limiting my companyspecific risk for anyone wanting access to their sector i recommend taking a serious look at both asc and stng i am hesitant to provide the exact price targets but if current market conditions persist asc could easily double disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in asc over the next  hours the
