the work of architect antoni gaudí gaudís influence opened many previously unimagined possibilities for saint phalle especially with regard to the use of unusual materials and objetstrouvés as structural elements in sculpture and architecture saint phalle was particularly struck by gaudís park güell which would inspire her to one day create her own gardenbased artwork that would combine artistic and natural elements saint phalle continued to paint particularly after she and her family moved to paris in the mids her first art exhibition was held in  in switzerland where she displayed her naïve style of oil painting in  she met the swiss artist jean tinguely and his wife artist eva aeppli saint phalle attempted her first largescale sculpture enlisting tinguely to make an iron

encountered multiple artworks by yves klein marcel duchamp daniel spoerri willem de kooning jackson pollock robert rauschenberg and jasper johns seeing these avantgarde works triggered her first great artistic crisis she switched from oil painting to gouaches and gloss paint and began to produce assemblages from household objects and castoffs by this time she had decided to dedicate herself fully

autel dor golden altar  resembles smaller versions of the tirs series but was not shot or paintsplattered saint phalle created a series of works in the early s she called tirs shootings or shots the series began as target pictures with painted bullseye targets prominently displayed within her painted collages such as saint sébastien portrait of my loverportrait of my belovedmartyr nécessaire  or assemblage figure with dartboard head  she would invite viewers to throw darts at the dartboards embedded as faces in her figurative assemblages which were influenced by the targets painted by her friend jasper johns soon she would start by embedding knives razor blades scissors eggbeaters babydoll arms and other household items in plaster covering a large board along with bags filled with colorful paints cans of spray paint and sometimes a tomato in addition she might suspend bags of paint or cans of spray paint in front of the whitepainted assemblage she would then repeatedly shoot the assemblage with a pistol rifle or miniature cannon causing the liquids to bleed or to spray out her first staged public shooting event was in february  attended by jean tinguely daniel spoerri and pierre restany among others as founder of the nouveau réalisme new realist movement restany asked saint phalle to join this group of french artists upon seeing her performance she was the only female member of this group these extreme expressions of violence attracted media attention catapulting saint phalle into the ranks of avantgarde artistic rebellion the tirs combined performance body art sculpture and painting in the artistic ferment of the s saint phalle began to stage variations on this process in art museums and galleries and recruited other artists to join in staged public happenings where some of her colleagues would also pull the trigger she met many other emerging artists through these performances including robert rauschenberg ad reinhardt frank stella and edward kienholz she would also invite gallery visitors to shoot at her assemblages she participated in spoerris edition mat multiplication d’art transformable program of multiple artwork editions supplying simpler versions of her tir works with detailed instructions on how to shoot them with a  rifle saint phalle carefully documented her artistic process in the tirs with writing still photos and films she would attach readymade common artifacts to a board attach bags of colorful paint whitewash everything and then dip the assemblage into milkwhite plaster once it had dried the assemblage was ready for shooting by a purchaser in june  niki de saint phalle and jean tinguely joined jasper johns and robert rauschenberg in a concerthappening called variations ii orchestrated by avantgarde american composer john cage and held at the american embassy in paris while david tudor played cage compositions on the piano the artists created their works of art on stage as the audience watched the proceedings in august  marcel duchamp introduced saint phalle and tinguely to salvador dalí who invited them to create a lifesized exploding bull with fireworks toro de fuego this homenage a dalí homage to dalí was wheeled out after the end of a traditional spanish bullfight in figueras catalonia spain and exploded in front of the audience an exclusive  openair shooting event in the malibu hills above los angeles was attended by hollywood celebrities including jane fonda and john houseman in most of these public performances saint phalle was impeccably dressed in a fashionable white pantsuit by  she had taken the series to galleries in new york city and los angeles inviting the public to participate in the shootings in los angeles she shot a largescale king kong assemblage she had constructed paintspattering the embedded sculpted faces of politicians such as john f kennedy fidel castro and charles de gaulle with santa claus and donald duck as well this work would later be acquired by the moderna museet in stockholm and would mark her transition to a new series of fantastic monsters animals and female figures throughout her career snakes birds and dragons would become recurring symbols in her artworks in  saint phalle and tinguely purchased an old hotel called auberge au cheval blanc white horse inn in soisysurecole it had previously been a brothel but the new owners converted it into artistic studios which they would share over the decades to come nanas edit gwendolyn  le poète et sa muse poet and his muse  blue nana  a nana a black nana saint phalle next explored the various roles of women in what would develop into her bestknown and most prolific series of sculptures she started making lifesize dolls of women such as brides and mothers giving birth monsters and large heads initially they were made of soft materials such as wool cloth and papiermâché but they soon evolved into plaster over a wire framework and plastic toys some painted all white as the series developed into larger monumental works saint phalle used composite fiberglassreinforced polyester plastic also known as frp or grp decorated with multiple brightcolored acrylic or polyester paints she also used polyurethane foam in many of her sculptures these innovative materials enabled the construction of colorful largescale sculptures with a new ease and fluidity of form however the fabrication and painting processes can release large numbers of glass fibers and chemicals such as styrene epoxy and solvent fumes which may cause health problems if not used carefully in  she created a series of sculptures protesting stereotypical societal roles for women as child bearers devouring mothers witches and prostitutes some of her early artworks from this bride period depicted ghostly skeletal brides dressed in white which have been compared to miss havisham an ethereal character in charles dickens novel great expectations over time these figures became more joyful whimsical colorful and larger in scale inspired by a collaborative drawing with american artist larry rivers of his wife her pregnant friend clarice price saint phalle began to portray archetypal female figures with a more optimistic view of the position of women in society the newer figures took on ecstatic dance poses and even acrobatic positions such as handstands and cartwheels saint phalles lighthearted figures have been compared to the joyful dancers of matisse and the sturdy female figures by gaston lachaise aristide maillol and rodin by  she was calling her artistic expressions of the proverbial everywoman nanas after a french slang word that is roughly equivalent to broad or chick the first of these freelyposed forms—made of papiermâché yarn and cloth—were exhibited at the alexander iolas gallery in paris in september  for this show iolas published saint phalles first artist book that included her handwritten text in combination with her drawings of bananas during this show she joined a type of tombola raffle organized by the artists club of new york whereby artworks were randomly left in coinoperated luggage lockers at pennsylvania station and keys were offered for  each encouraged by iolas she started a highly productive output of graphic work that accompanied exhibitions which included silkscreened prints posters books and writings in  saint phalle collaborated with jean tinguely and per olof ultvedt sv on a temporary indoor sculpture installation honen katedral also spelled honenkatedrall which literally means sheacathedral in swedish filling a large space in the moderna museet in stockholm sweden during construction saint phalle recruited swiss art student rico weber de who had been working as a dishwasher in the museum restaurant in the following years he would become an important assistant and collaborator for both saint phalle and tinguely a team of  people worked strenuously for  days first building a frame using metal rebar covering it with chicken wire sheathing it with fabric attached with a smelly animal glue and then painting the inside of the enclosure black and covering the outside in bright colors the final structure was  feet  m long and  feet  m wide weighing around  tonnes  kg the outer form was a giant reclining sculpture of a pregnant woman a nana whose internal body cavity could be entered through a doorsized vaginal opening between her legs written on one of hons massive thighs was the motto honi soit qui mal y pense shamed be he who evil of it thinks inside the massive sculpture were a seat cinema theater a milk bar inside a breast a fish pond and a brain built by tinguely with moving mechanical parts in addition the sprawling nana contained a coin telephone a loveseat sofa a museum of fake paintings a sandwich vending machine an art installation by ultvedt and a playground slide for children after an initial shocked silence the installation elicited immense public commentary in magazines and newspapers throughout the world raising awareness of the moderna museet over  visitors crowded in to experience the immersive environment including many children at the end of  months the entire temporary setup was demolished and removed except for the head which was preserved by the museum in its permanent collection some small fragments were attached to limitededition exhibition catalogs and sold as mementos around this time saint phalle also designed stage sets and costumes for theatrical productions éloge de la folie praise of the madness  a ballet by roland petit an adaptation of the aristophanes play lysistrata  and a germanlanguage play she cowrote with rainer von diez titled ich all about me  large fixed or moveable nana figures were prominent in several of these productions in  saint phalle began working with polyester resin a material which could be shaped easily but would transform into a hard smooth weatherresistant surface this new technology enabled her to construct enormous fantastical figures for display outdoors in public spaces and parks the material is reasonably durable outdoors similar materials are used for boats and car bodies though decades of weather exposure would eventually cause deterioration requiring art conservation measures in  she exhibited le paradis fantastique the fantastic paradise a collaborative grouping of  of her sculptures with  machines built by tinguely on the rooftop terrace of the level french pavilion at expo  in montreal the composition was originally conceived of as an attack by tinguelys dark mechanical constructions upon saint phalles brightlycolored animals and female figures a kind of amorous warfare although the french pavilion itself was popular most visitors did not see the rooftop terrace where the sculptures were installed in  the sculptures were redisplayed at the albrightknox gallery in buffalo new york and in new york central park in  some of the artworks were purchased by the moderna museet in stockholm sweden and permanently installed in an outdoors sculpture garden in  she first disclosed that she had developed respiratory problems from exposure to dust and fumes in making her artwork starting in  saint phalle sold nana inflatable pool toys amid criticism from the art world she ignored the complaints focusing on raising money for her future monumental projects in the coming years she would face more criticism for overcommercializing and popularizing her artwork but she raised significant funding that enabled her to finance several ambitious projects on her own over the years she produced clothing jewelry perfume glass or porcelain figures furniture and craft items many with a nana theme from  she worked on her first fullscale architecture project three small sculptural houses for rainer von diez in southern france which she called le rêve de loiseau fr the dream of the bird the project was a collaboration with him and jean tinguely and a forerunner of her later tarot garden project that same year she joined several other artists under the lead of tinguely starting work on le cyclop also known as la tête meaning the head or le monstre dans la forêt meaning the monster in the forest in millylaforêt near paris collaborators included daniel spoerri bernhard luginbuhl and eva aeppli eventually  different people worked on the project which would not be considered finished until  in november  as part of an artists reunion celebrating the th anniversary of the founding of the nouveaux réalistes saint phalle shot at an altar assemblage on  july  saint phalle and tinguely legally became married though the immediate reason may have been tax savings as saint phalle thus became a swiss citizen their marriage did give the two artists mutual control over each others artistic estate if one of them should die that same year she designed her first pieces of jewelry in  she installed golem commissioned by the then mayor teddy kollek at a childrens playground in the kiryat hayovel neighborhood of jerusalem it is a giant monster with three red tongues protruding from its mouth which serve as playground slides starting

in all fairy tales before finding the treasure i met on my path dragons sorcerors magicians and the angel of temperance —niki de saint phalle ” in  saint phalle had visited antoni gaudís parc güell in barcelona spain which inspired her to use diverse materials and found objects as essential elements in her art another influence was the parco dei mostri in bomarzo in the tuscany region of italy in the late s she and jean tinguely had visited le palais idéal built by ferdinand cheval in hauterives france as well as simon rodia’s watts towers in los angeles in the early s both locations were examples of fantastical outsider art and architecture built by ordinary working men of modest means but expansive vision saint phalle decided that she wanted to make something similar a monumental sculpture garden but created by a woman the initial sponsors for her ambitious project were members of the italian agnelli family in  saint phalle became ill with a pulmonary abscess from her work with polyester and was hospitalized in arizona she then recuperated in st moritz switzerland she reconnected with marella caracciolo agnelli a friend from the s in new york and told agnelli about her

around four years but tinguely remained a constantly reappearing presence in her life in  she also visited mexico and new mexico in search of wider artistic inspirations in  saint phalle started to lay out her sculpture garden in an abandoned quarry in garavicchio tuscany about  kilometres  mi northwest of rome along the coast the following year sites were cleared and foundations were established in  she produced the first of what would become a new series of sculptures the skinnies these were flat planar seethrough outlines of heads and figures highlighted by patches of color in some ways they resembled her colorful sketches and drawings but scaled up to monumental size she also continued to produce her nanas in addition to her new style of sculpture both styles of figures would appear in her tarot garden project in  saint phalle and her team began to build the first architectural sculpture in the garden as the project progressed saint phalle started taking lessons in the italian language to better communicate with local workers the second crew member she hired was ugo celletti a yearold parttime postal delivery man who discovered a love for mosaic work on the project he would work on the project for  years and recruit his nephews to join in some family members are still involved in maintaining the site she invited artist friends from argentina scotland holland and france to help work on the sculptures over time saint phalle worked with dozens of people including architects ceramicists iron workers brick layers painters and mosaic artists the materials used in the tarot garden project would include steel iron cement polyester ceramic mosaic glass mirrors and polished stones which she called mms the structure of the larger sculptures was very similar to the temporary hon installation at the moderna museet in  but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the longterm weathering effects of sun and rain the basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar a second layer of lightergauge steel reinforcement bars was added followed by two layers of expanded metal a specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure a layer of tar for waterproofing and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy hollow structure ready for decoration in  she also began selling a series of polyester snake chairs vases and lamps that year she recorded her first attack of rheumatoid arthritis a painful disease affecting the joints of the skeleton in  she designed a colorful paint scheme for a piper aerostar  p twinengine airplane which participated in the first transatlantic race sponsored by the peter stuyvesant foundation of amsterdam as an act of playful rebellion against the cigarette manufacturer sponsor she added a no smoking sign visible on the belly of the plane she was allergic to tobacco smoke in  saint phalle rented a small house near the tarot garden and hired young people from garavicchio to help with construction of the garden jean tinguely led a swiss team comprising seppi imhoff and rico weber and started welding the frames of the sculptures the following year dutch artist doc winsen also called dok van winsen took up the welding operations in  she developed and marketed an eponymous perfume using the proceeds to help finance her project the perfume bottle top featured a small sculpture of two intertwined snakes one golden and the other brightly multicolored she may have raised as much as a third of the funds she needed for the garden in this way she actively solicited funding from friends and acquaintances as well as by selling her artworks in  saint phalle collaborated with tinguely to produce the stravinsky fountain a piece sculptural fountain for igor stravinsky square located next to the centre georges pompidou in paris because of its prominent location in paris it would become one of the bestknown collaborations between the two artists from  onwards when on site saint phalle lived in a small apartment built into the empress a housesized sphinxlike sculpture in the garden on the second level her bedroom was inside one breast and her kitchen was inside the other one each of these two rooms had a single recessed circular window appearing as an inverted nipple when viewed from the outside in  she would recall at last my lifelong wish to live inside a sculpture was going to be granted a space entirely made out of undulating curves  i wanted to invent a new mother a mother goddess and be reborn within its form  i would sleep in one breast in the other i would put my kitchen the ground floor contained a large mirrored space with a mirrored dining table where she would serve lunch to workmen and artists beneath a chandelier tinguely had made with a cow skull she used this motherly role to help reinforce her authority in directing the team of men she needed to help build her project eventually she would grow tired of the cramped space in the womb of her mother and after  would move into a newyorkloftstyle studio which she had built for herself underground at the site around  saint phalle decided to cover her tarot garden sculptures primarily in durable ceramic colored tiles adding shards of mirrors and glass and polished stones ricardo menon helped her recruit venera finocchiaro a ceramics teacher from rome she taught local women new techniques for molding ceramic pieces to curved surfaces and installed onsite ovens to finish the pieces starting in  jean tinguely added motorized and stationary steel sculptures and fountains to the project robert haligon and his sons did much of the work which involved polyester resins saint phalle asked pierre marie lejeune to create a cement path which he inscribed with hieroglyphs other signs and symbols and text during this period saint phalle dedicated almost all of her time to living and working at the garden in  ricardo menon left to attend a drama school in paris while there he recruited marcelo zitelli to work for saint phalle as a gardener but he in turn became her assistant for other work as

intolerance she saw while working in jerusalem the city of nîmes france commissioned her to build the architectural sculpture but the project never was built due to politics over the years she had become interested in myths and religious traditions beyond her childhood roman catholic upbringing including jewish hindu buddhist and ancient egyptian beliefs in  remedial maintenance on the tarot

hyperthyroidism and tachycardia which were eventually treated by an operation in  in  saint phalle first encountered multiple artworks by yves klein marcel duchamp daniel spoerri willem de kooning jackson pollock robert rauschenberg and jasper johns seeing these avantgarde works triggered her first great artistic crisis she switched from oil painting to gouaches and gloss paint and began to produce assemblages from household objects and castoffs by this time she had decided to dedicate herself fully to creating art free from the obligations of everyday family life in  she and harry separated by mutual agreement and her husband moved to another apartment with their two children at that time her daughter laura was  and her son philip was  years old mathews would occasionally buy artworks from his wife as a way of providing her modest support and she would visit him and the children periodically she soon moved in with jean tinguely who by then had separated from his wife eva aeppli he was becoming wellknown for his kinetic sculptures made from castoff mechanisms and junk in many ways the pair were polar opposites and sometimes had violent disagreements and frequent affairs with others they would live together intermittently and collaborate closely on artistic projects for over a decade before marrying in  two years later they separated but remained on good terms and continued to collaborate on various projects up through tinguelys death in  in  tinguely introduced her to pontus hultén then the director of the moderna museet modern museum in stockholm sweden over the next few years he would invite her to participate in important exhibitions and acquire her artworks for the museum he would later become the first director of the centre georges pompidou in paris  where he continued to be influential in promoting wider recognition of saint phalles artwork tirs edit autel dor golden altar  resembles smaller versions of the tirs series but was not shot or paintsplattered saint phalle created a series of works in the early s she called tirs shootings or shots the series began as target pictures with painted bullseye targets prominently displayed within her painted collages such as saint sébastien portrait of my loverportrait of my belovedmartyr nécessaire  or assemblage figure with dartboard head  she would invite viewers to throw darts at the dartboards embedded as faces in her figurative assemblages which were influenced by the targets painted by her friend jasper johns soon she would start by embedding knives razor blades scissors eggbeaters babydoll arms and other household items in plaster covering a large board along with bags filled with colorful paints cans of spray paint and sometimes a tomato in addition she might suspend bags of paint or cans of spray paint in front of the whitepainted assemblage she would then repeatedly shoot the assemblage with a pistol rifle or miniature cannon causing the liquids to bleed or to spray out her first staged public shooting event was in february  attended by jean tinguely daniel spoerri and pierre restany among others as founder of the nouveau réalisme new realist movement restany asked saint phalle to join this group of french artists upon seeing her performance she was the only female member of this group these extreme expressions of violence attracted media attention catapulting saint phalle into the ranks of avantgarde artistic rebellion the tirs combined performance body art sculpture and painting in the artistic ferment of the s saint phalle began to stage variations on this process in art museums and galleries and recruited other artists to join in staged public happenings where some of her colleagues would also pull the trigger she met many other emerging artists through these performances including robert rauschenberg ad reinhardt frank stella and edward kienholz she would also invite gallery visitors to shoot at her assemblages she participated in spoerris edition mat multiplication d’art transformable program of multiple artwork editions supplying simpler versions of her tir works with detailed instructions on how to shoot them with a  rifle saint phalle carefully documented her artistic process in the tirs with writing still photos and films she would attach readymade common artifacts to a board attach bags of colorful paint whitewash everything and then dip the assemblage into milkwhite plaster once it had dried the assemblage was ready for shooting by a purchaser in june  niki de saint phalle and jean tinguely joined jasper johns and robert rauschenberg in a concerthappening called variations ii orchestrated by avantgarde american composer john cage and held at the american embassy in paris while david tudor played cage compositions on the piano the artists created their works of art on stage as the audience watched the proceedings in august  marcel duchamp introduced saint phalle and tinguely to salvador dalí who invited them to create a lifesized exploding bull with fireworks toro de fuego this homenage a dalí homage to dalí was wheeled out after the end of a traditional spanish bullfight in figueras catalonia spain and exploded in front of the audience an exclusive  openair shooting event in the malibu hills above los angeles was attended by hollywood celebrities including jane fonda and john houseman in most of these public performances saint phalle was impeccably dressed in a fashionable white pantsuit by  she had taken the series to galleries in new york city and los angeles inviting the public to participate in the shootings in los angeles she shot a largescale king kong assemblage she had constructed paintspattering the embedded sculpted faces of politicians such as john f kennedy fidel castro and charles de gaulle with santa claus and donald duck as well this work would later be acquired by the moderna museet in stockholm and would mark her transition to a new series of fantastic monsters animals and female figures throughout her career snakes birds and dragons would become recurring symbols in her artworks in  saint phalle and tinguely purchased an old hotel called auberge au cheval blanc white horse inn in soisysurecole it had previously been a brothel but the new owners converted it into artistic studios which they would share over the decades to come nanas edit gwendolyn  le poète et sa muse poet and his muse  blue nana  a nana a black nana saint phalle next explored the various roles of women in what would develop into her bestknown and most prolific series of sculptures she started making lifesize dolls of women such as brides and mothers giving birth monsters and large heads initially they were made of soft materials such as wool cloth and papiermâché but they soon evolved into plaster over a wire framework and plastic toys some painted all white as the series developed into larger monumental works saint phalle used composite fiberglassreinforced polyester plastic also known as frp or grp decorated with multiple brightcolored acrylic or polyester paints she also used polyurethane foam in many of her sculptures these innovative materials enabled the construction of colorful largescale sculptures with a new ease and fluidity of form however the fabrication and painting processes can release large numbers of glass fibers and chemicals such as styrene epoxy and solvent fumes which may cause health problems if not used carefully in  she created a series of sculptures protesting stereotypical societal roles for women as child bearers devouring mothers witches and prostitutes some of her early artworks from this bride period depicted ghostly skeletal brides dressed in white which have been compared to miss havisham an ethereal character in charles dickens novel great expectations over time these figures became more joyful whimsical colorful and larger in scale inspired by a collaborative drawing with american artist larry rivers of his wife her pregnant friend clarice price saint phalle began to portray archetypal female figures with a more optimistic view of the position of women in society the newer figures took on ecstatic dance poses and even acrobatic positions such as handstands and cartwheels saint phalles lighthearted figures have been compared to the joyful dancers of matisse and the sturdy female figures by gaston lachaise aristide maillol and rodin by  she was calling her artistic expressions of the proverbial everywoman nanas after a french slang word that is roughly equivalent to broad or chick the first of these freelyposed forms—made of papiermâché yarn and cloth—were exhibited at the alexander iolas gallery in paris in september  for this show iolas published saint phalles first artist book that included her handwritten text in combination with her drawings of bananas during this show she joined a type of tombola raffle organized by the artists club of new york whereby artworks were randomly left in coinoperated luggage lockers at pennsylvania station and keys were offered for  each encouraged by iolas she started a highly productive output of graphic work that accompanied exhibitions which included silkscreened prints posters books and writings in  saint phalle collaborated with jean tinguely and per olof ultvedt sv on a temporary indoor sculpture installation honen katedral also spelled honenkatedrall which literally means sheacathedral in swedish filling a large space in the moderna museet in stockholm sweden during construction saint phalle recruited swiss art student rico weber de who had been working as a dishwasher in the museum restaurant in the following years he would become an important assistant and collaborator for both saint phalle and tinguely a team of  people worked strenuously for  days first building a frame using metal rebar covering it with chicken wire sheathing it with fabric attached with a smelly animal glue and then painting the inside of the enclosure black and covering the outside in bright colors the final structure was  feet  m long and  feet  m wide weighing around  tonnes  kg the outer form was a giant reclining sculpture of a pregnant woman a nana whose internal body cavity could be entered through a doorsized vaginal opening between her legs written on one of hons massive thighs was the motto honi soit qui mal y pense shamed be he who evil of it thinks inside the massive sculpture were a seat cinema theater a milk bar inside a breast a fish pond and a brain built by tinguely with moving mechanical parts in addition the sprawling nana contained a coin telephone a loveseat sofa a museum of fake paintings a sandwich vending machine an art installation by ultvedt and a playground slide for children after an initial shocked silence the installation elicited immense public commentary in magazines and newspapers throughout the world raising awareness of the moderna museet over  visitors crowded in to experience the immersive environment including many children at the end of  months the entire temporary setup was demolished and removed except for the head which was preserved by the museum in its permanent collection some small fragments were attached to limitededition exhibition catalogs and sold as mementos around this time saint phalle also designed stage sets and costumes for theatrical productions éloge de la folie praise of the madness  a ballet by roland petit an adaptation of the aristophanes play lysistrata  and a germanlanguage play she cowrote with rainer von diez titled ich all about me  large fixed or moveable nana figures were prominent in several of these productions in  saint phalle began working with polyester resin a material which could be shaped easily but would transform into a hard smooth weatherresistant surface this new technology enabled her to construct enormous fantastical figures for display outdoors in public spaces and parks the material is reasonably durable outdoors similar materials are used for boats and car bodies though decades of weather exposure would eventually cause deterioration requiring art conservation measures in  she exhibited le paradis fantastique the fantastic paradise a collaborative grouping of  of her sculptures with  machines built by tinguely on the rooftop terrace of the level french pavilion at expo  in montreal the composition was originally conceived of as an attack by tinguelys dark mechanical constructions upon saint phalles brightlycolored animals and female figures a kind of amorous warfare although the french pavilion itself was popular most visitors did not see the rooftop terrace where the sculptures were installed in  the sculptures were redisplayed at the albrightknox gallery in buffalo new york and in new york central park in  some of the artworks were purchased by the moderna museet in stockholm sweden and permanently installed in an outdoors sculpture garden in  she first disclosed that she had developed respiratory problems from exposure to dust and fumes in making her artwork starting in  saint phalle sold nana inflatable pool toys amid criticism from the art world she ignored the complaints focusing on raising money for her future monumental projects in the coming years she would face more criticism for overcommercializing and popularizing her artwork but she raised significant funding that enabled her to finance several ambitious projects on her own over the years she produced clothing jewelry perfume glass or porcelain figures furniture and craft items many with a nana theme from  she worked on her first fullscale architecture project three small sculptural houses for rainer von diez in southern france which she called le rêve de loiseau fr the dream of the bird the project was a collaboration with him and jean tinguely and a forerunner of her later tarot garden project that same year she joined several other artists under the lead of tinguely starting work on le cyclop also known as la tête meaning the head or le monstre dans la forêt meaning the monster in the forest in millylaforêt near paris collaborators included daniel spoerri bernhard luginbuhl and eva aeppli eventually  different people worked on the project which would not be considered finished until  in november  as part of an artists reunion celebrating the th anniversary of the founding of the nouveaux réalistes saint phalle shot at an altar assemblage on  july  saint phalle and tinguely legally became married though the immediate reason may have been tax savings as saint phalle thus became a swiss citizen their marriage did give the two artists mutual control over each others artistic estate if one of them should die that same year she designed her first pieces of jewelry in  she installed golem commissioned by the then mayor teddy kollek at a childrens playground in the kiryat hayovel neighborhood of jerusalem it is a giant monster with three red tongues protruding from its mouth which serve as playground slides starting in  she engaged robert haligon fabricant de plastiques d’art to help fabricate her largescale sculptures as well as multiple editions of artworks this collaboration would continue for many years including both his sons notably gérard who would take the lead in later years in  saint phalle shot footage for the surreal horror film daddy about a deeply troubled fatherdaughter lovehate relationship the filming was done in a rented castle near grasse in southeastern france in association with filmmaker peter whitehead in november the film was shown in london the following january she produced a new version of the film with additional scenes in soisy and in new york and an expanded cast the revised version premiered at lincoln center for the th new york film festival in april she was also commissioned to design the cover of the program for the festival saint phalle continued to create nanas for the rest of her life but would soon focus her attention on a comprehensive project in italy le paradis fantastique  stravinsky fountain  tarot garden edit main article tarot garden “ the tarot garden is not just my garden it is also the garden of all those who helped me make it i am the architect of the garden i imposed my vision because i could not do otherwise the garden was made with difficulties wild enthusiasm obsession and most of all faith nothing could have stopped me as in all fairy tales before finding the treasure i met on my path dragons sorcerors magicians and the angel of temperance —niki de saint phalle ” in  saint phalle had visited antoni gaudís parc güell in barcelona spain which inspired her to use diverse materials and found objects as essential elements in her art another influence was the parco dei mostri in bomarzo in the tuscany region of italy in the late s she and jean tinguely had visited le palais idéal built by ferdinand cheval in hauterives france as well as simon rodia’s watts towers in los angeles in the early s both locations were examples of fantastical outsider art and architecture built by ordinary working men of modest means but expansive vision saint phalle decided that she wanted to make something similar a monumental sculpture garden but created by a woman the initial sponsors for her ambitious project were members of the italian agnelli family in  saint phalle became ill with a pulmonary abscess from her work with polyester and was hospitalized in arizona she then recuperated in st moritz switzerland she reconnected with marella caracciolo agnelli a friend from the s in new york and told agnelli about her ideas for a fantasy garden in  agnellis brothers carlo and nicola caracciolo offered a parcel of their land in tuscany for the gardens site in  saint phalle wrote the screenplay for un rêve plus long que la nuit a dream longer than the night later also called camélia et le dragon and she recruited many of her artist friends to help make it into a film a phantasmagorical tale of dragons monsters and adolescence a young girl is held captive by a dragon manages to escape and must explore sept portes du mystère seven doors of mystery to find love saint phalles daughter laura was the lead character in the film appearing with saint phalle jean tinguely and other artist friends peter whitehead composed the music for the filming she designed several pieces of furniture which were later displayed on the facade of the palais des beauxarts fine arts palace in brussels from  she also worked on last night i had a dream a sculptural relief painting that included many elements from her earlier life and dreams in  she retreated to the swiss alps to refine her plans for the sculpture park in  ricardo menon became her assistant working closely with her until  in  she worked with the english writer constantin mulgrave to design sets for the traveling companion based on a hans christian andersen fairy tale but the project was never completed she and mulgrave lived together for around four years but tinguely remained a constantly reappearing presence in her life in  she also visited mexico and new mexico in search of wider artistic inspirations in  saint phalle started to lay out her sculpture garden in an abandoned quarry in garavicchio tuscany about  kilometres  mi northwest of rome along the coast the following year sites were cleared and foundations were established in  she produced the first of what would become a new series of sculptures the skinnies these were flat planar seethrough outlines of heads and figures highlighted by patches of color in some ways they resembled her colorful sketches and drawings but scaled up to monumental size she also continued to produce her nanas in addition to her new style of sculpture both styles of figures would appear in her tarot garden project in  saint phalle and her team began to build the first architectural sculpture in the garden as the project progressed saint phalle started taking lessons in the italian language to better communicate with local workers the second crew member she hired was ugo celletti a yearold parttime postal delivery man who discovered a love for mosaic work on the project he would work on the project for  years and recruit his nephews to join in some family members are still involved in maintaining the site she invited artist friends from argentina scotland holland and france to help work on the sculptures over time saint phalle worked with dozens of people including architects ceramicists iron workers brick layers painters and mosaic artists the materials used in the tarot garden project would include steel iron cement polyester ceramic mosaic glass mirrors and polished stones which she called mms the structure of the larger sculptures was very similar to the temporary hon installation at the moderna museet in  but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the longterm weathering effects of sun and rain the basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar a second layer of lightergauge steel reinforcement bars was added followed by two layers of expanded metal a specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure a layer of tar for waterproofing and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy hollow structure ready for decoration in  she also began selling a series of polyester snake chairs vases and lamps that year she recorded her first attack of rheumatoid arthritis a painful disease affecting the joints of the skeleton in  she designed a colorful paint scheme for a piper aerostar  p twinengine airplane which participated in the first transatlantic race sponsored by the peter stuyvesant foundation of amsterdam as an act of playful rebellion against the cigarette manufacturer sponsor she added a no smoking sign visible on the belly of the plane she was allergic to tobacco smoke in  saint phalle rented a small house near the tarot garden and hired young people from garavicchio to help with construction of the garden jean tinguely led a swiss team comprising seppi imhoff and rico weber and started welding the frames of the sculptures the following year dutch artist doc winsen also called dok van winsen took up the welding operations in  she developed and marketed an eponymous perfume using the proceeds to help finance her project the perfume bottle top featured a small sculpture of two intertwined snakes one golden and the other brightly multicolored she may have raised as much as a third of the funds she needed for the garden in this way she actively solicited funding from friends and acquaintances as well as by selling her artworks in  saint phalle collaborated with tinguely to produce the stravinsky fountain a piece sculptural fountain for igor stravinsky square located next to the centre georges pompidou in paris because of its prominent location in paris it would become one of the bestknown collaborations between the two artists from  onwards when on site saint phalle lived in a small apartment built into the empress a housesized sphinxlike sculpture in the garden on the second level her bedroom was inside one breast and her kitchen was inside the other one each of these two rooms had a single recessed circular window appearing as an inverted nipple when viewed from the outside in  she would recall at last my lifelong wish to live inside a sculpture was going to be granted a space entirely made out of undulating curves  i wanted to invent a new mother a mother goddess and be reborn within its form  i would sleep in one breast in the other i would put my kitchen the ground floor contained a large mirrored space with a mirrored dining table where she would serve lunch to workmen and artists beneath a chandelier tinguely had made with a cow skull she used this motherly role to help reinforce her authority in directing the team of men she needed to help build her project eventually she would grow tired of the cramped space in the womb of her mother and after  would move into a newyorkloftstyle studio which she had built for herself underground at the site around  saint phalle decided to cover her tarot garden sculptures primarily in durable ceramic colored tiles adding shards of mirrors and glass and polished stones ricardo menon helped her recruit venera finocchiaro a ceramics teacher from rome she taught local women new techniques for molding ceramic pieces to curved surfaces and installed onsite ovens to finish the pieces starting in  jean tinguely added motorized and stationary steel sculptures and fountains to the project robert haligon and his sons did much of the work which involved polyester resins saint phalle asked pierre marie lejeune to create a cement path which he inscribed with hieroglyphs other signs and symbols and text during this period saint phalle dedicated almost all of her time to living and working at the garden in  ricardo menon left to attend a drama school in paris while there he recruited marcelo zitelli to work for saint phalle as a gardener but he in turn became her assistant for other work as well helping her fabricate sculptures for at least the next decade the same year saint phalle took some time to collaborate with silvio barandun de a german medical professor of immunology in writing and illustrating her book aids you can’t catch it holding hands intended for students in middle school or high school it was first published in san francisco in english then later translated into five different languages  copies were sold or given to medical institutions and schools from  saint phalle spent more of her time in paris where she developed many of the smaller sculptures for the garden from time to time she would organize gallery shows of her art including maquettes of her larger works to raise funds for the garden project saint phalle also worked on establishing a permanent legal structure for the preservation and maintenance of the garden in  she produced a maquette for le temple idéal the ideal temple a place of worship welcoming all religions in response to the religious intolerance she saw while working in jerusalem the city of nîmes france commissioned her to build the architectural sculpture but the project never was built due to politics over the years she had become interested in myths and religious traditions beyond her childhood roman catholic upbringing including jewish hindu buddhist and ancient egyptian beliefs in  remedial maintenance on the tarot garden sculptures was performed using new glues and silicones to attach mirrors and glass elements more securely to withstand weathering and the touch of many visitors hands as of update a similar restoration process of reattaching mirrors is ongoing with le cyclop located in millylaforêt near

education which she wrote about decades later after an early marriage and two children she began creating art in a naïve experimental style she first received worldwide attention for angry violent

tarot garden a large sculpture garden containing numerous works ranging up to housesized creations her idiosyncratic style has been called outsider art she had no formal training in art but associated freely with many other contemporary artists writers and composers throughout her creative career she collaborated with other wellknown artists such as jasper johns robert rauschenberg larry rivers composer john cage and architect mario botta as well as dozens of lessknown artists and craftspersons for several decades she worked especially closely with swiss kinetic artist jean tinguely who also became her second husband in her later years she suffered from multiple chronic health problems attributed to repeated exposure to glass fibers and petrochemical fumes from the experimental materials she had used in her pioneering artworks but she continued to create prolifically until the end of her life a critic has observed that saint phalles insistence on exuberance emotion and sensuality her pursuit of the figurative and her bold use of color have not endeared her to everyone in a minimalist age she was wellknown in europe but her work was littleseen in the us until her final years in san

temperamental and violent beating the younger children and forcing them to eat even if they were not hungry both elizabeth and richard de saint phalle younger siblings would later commit suicide as adults the atmosphere at home was tense the only place where niki felt comfortable and warm was in the kitchen overseen by a black cook decades later niki would reveal that she had suffered years of

fantastique  an early collaboration of saint phalle and jean tinguely at the age of  saint phalle married harry mathews whom she had first met the age of  he was  through her father six years later they met each other by chance on a train to princeton and soon became a couple initially they had a civil ceremony on  june  in new york city hall at the urging of nikis mother they also had a religious rite at the french church of new york the following february although her parents accepted the union her husbands family objected to her catholic background and cut them off financially causing them to resort to occasional shoplifting they moved to cambridge massachusetts so mathews could study music at harvard university saint phalle began to paint in oils and gouaches but aimed to pursue a career in acting their first child laura was born in april  in  the small family moved to paris where harry continued his studies in conducting at i’ecole normale de musique paris normal school of music the new parents were casual even negligent in their care but their children would benefit from better financial circumstances after mathews received an inheritance saint phalle rejected the staid conservative values of her family which dictated domestic positions for wives and particular strict rules of conduct poet john ashbery recalled that saint phalles artistic pursuits were rejected in turn by relatives her uncle french banker count alexandre de saintphalle  reportedly takes a dim view of her artistic activities ashbery observednote  however after marrying young and becoming a mother she found herself living the same bourgeois lifestyle that she had attempted to escape for about a decade the family would wander around france and europe living a bohemian lifestyle in nice saint phalle and mathews would have separate affairs in  after she attacked her husbands mistress she took an overdose of sleeping pills but they had little effect because she was manic at the time when harry discovered a stash of knives razors and scissors under a mattress he took his wife to a mental clinic in nice where she was treated with electroshock therapy and insulin shock liberated from routine household work she focused on creating artwork instead and improved enough to be discharged in six weeks around the same time her husband abandoned his music studies and started to write his first novel eventually switching to a career in writing while in paris on a modeling assignment in  saint phalle was introduced to the americanfrench painter hugh weiss fr who became both her friend and artistic mentor he encouraged her to continue painting in her selftaught style in september  the small family moved to deià majorca spain where her son philip was born in may  while in spain saint phalle read the works of proust and visited madrid and barcelona where she became deeply affected by the work of architect antoni gaudí gaudís influence opened many previously unimagined possibilities for saint phalle especially with regard to the use of unusual materials and objetstrouvés as structural elements in sculpture and architecture saint phalle was particularly struck by gaudís park güell which would inspire her to one day create her own gardenbased artwork that would combine artistic and natural elements saint phalle continued to paint particularly after she and her family moved to paris in the mids her first art exhibition was held in  in switzerland where she displayed her naïve style of oil painting in  she met the swiss artist jean tinguely and his wife artist eva aeppli saint phalle attempted her first largescale sculpture enlisting tinguely to make an iron armature which she covered with plaster and paint in the late s saint phalle became ill with hyperthyroidism and tachycardia which were eventually treated by an operation in  in  saint phalle first encountered multiple artworks by yves klein marcel duchamp daniel spoerri willem de kooning jackson pollock robert rauschenberg and jasper johns seeing these avantgarde works triggered her first great artistic crisis she switched from oil painting to gouaches and gloss paint and began to produce assemblages from household objects and castoffs by this time she had decided to dedicate herself fully to creating art free from the obligations of everyday family life in  she and harry separated by mutual agreement and her husband moved to another apartment with their two children at that time her daughter laura was  and her son philip was  years old mathews would occasionally buy artworks from his wife as a way of providing her modest support and she would visit him and the children periodically she soon moved in with jean tinguely who by then had separated from his wife eva aeppli he was becoming wellknown for his kinetic sculptures made from castoff mechanisms and junk in many ways the pair were polar opposites and sometimes had violent disagreements and frequent affairs with others they would live together intermittently and collaborate closely on artistic projects for over a decade before marrying in  two years later they separated but remained on good terms and continued to collaborate on various projects up through tinguelys death in  in  tinguely introduced her to pontus hultén then the director of the moderna museet modern museum in stockholm sweden over the next few years he would invite her to participate in important exhibitions and acquire her artworks for the museum he would later become the first director of the centre georges pompidou in paris  where he continued to be influential in promoting wider recognition of saint phalles artwork tirs edit autel dor golden altar  resembles smaller versions of the tirs series but was not shot or paintsplattered saint phalle created a series of works in the early s she called tirs shootings or shots the series began as target pictures with painted bullseye targets prominently displayed within her painted collages such as saint sébastien portrait of my loverportrait of my belovedmartyr nécessaire  or assemblage figure with dartboard head  she would invite viewers to throw darts at the dartboards embedded as faces in her figurative assemblages which were influenced by the targets painted by her friend jasper johns soon she would start by embedding knives razor blades scissors eggbeaters babydoll arms and other household items in plaster covering a large board along with bags filled with colorful paints cans of spray paint and sometimes a tomato in addition she might suspend bags of paint or cans of spray paint in front of the whitepainted assemblage she would then repeatedly shoot the assemblage with a pistol rifle or miniature cannon causing the liquids to bleed or to spray out her first staged public shooting event was in february  attended by jean tinguely daniel spoerri and pierre restany among others as founder of the nouveau réalisme new realist movement restany asked saint phalle to join this group of french artists upon seeing her performance she was the only female member of this group these extreme expressions of violence attracted media attention catapulting saint phalle into the ranks of avantgarde artistic rebellion the tirs combined performance body art sculpture and painting in the artistic ferment of the s saint phalle began to stage variations on this process in art museums and galleries and recruited other artists to join in staged public happenings where some of her colleagues would also pull the trigger she met many other emerging artists through these performances including robert rauschenberg ad reinhardt frank stella and edward kienholz she would also invite gallery visitors to shoot at her assemblages she participated in spoerris edition mat multiplication d’art transformable program of multiple artwork editions supplying simpler versions of her tir works with detailed instructions on how to shoot them with a  rifle saint phalle carefully documented her artistic process in the tirs with writing still photos and films she would attach readymade common artifacts to a board attach bags of colorful paint whitewash everything and then dip the assemblage into milkwhite plaster once it had dried the assemblage was ready for shooting by a purchaser in june  niki de saint phalle and jean tinguely joined jasper johns and robert rauschenberg in a concerthappening called variations ii orchestrated by avantgarde american composer john cage and held at the american embassy in paris while david tudor played cage compositions on the piano the artists created their works of art on stage as the audience watched the proceedings in august  marcel duchamp introduced saint phalle and tinguely to salvador dalí who invited them to create a lifesized exploding bull with fireworks toro de fuego this homenage a dalí homage to dalí was wheeled out after the end of a traditional spanish bullfight in figueras catalonia spain and exploded in front of the audience an exclusive  openair shooting event in the malibu hills above los angeles was attended by hollywood celebrities including jane fonda and john houseman in most of these public performances saint phalle was impeccably dressed in a fashionable white pantsuit by  she had taken the series to galleries in new york city and los angeles inviting the public to participate in the shootings in los angeles she shot a largescale king kong assemblage she had constructed paintspattering the embedded sculpted faces of politicians such as john f kennedy fidel castro and charles de gaulle with santa claus and donald duck as well this work would later be acquired by the moderna museet in stockholm and would mark her transition to a new series of fantastic monsters animals and female figures throughout her career snakes birds and dragons would become recurring symbols in her artworks in  saint phalle and tinguely purchased an old hotel called auberge au cheval blanc white horse inn in soisysurecole it had previously been a brothel but the new owners converted it into artistic studios which they would share over the decades to come nanas edit gwendolyn  le poète et sa muse poet and his muse  blue nana  a nana a black nana saint phalle next explored the various roles of women in what would develop into her bestknown and most prolific series of sculptures she started making lifesize dolls of women such as brides and mothers giving birth monsters and large heads initially they were made of soft materials such as wool cloth and papiermâché but they soon evolved into plaster over a wire framework and plastic toys some painted all white as the series developed into larger monumental works saint phalle used composite fiberglassreinforced polyester plastic also known as frp or grp decorated with multiple brightcolored acrylic or polyester paints she also used polyurethane foam in many of her sculptures these innovative materials enabled the construction of colorful largescale sculptures with a new ease and fluidity of form however the fabrication and painting processes can release large numbers of glass fibers and chemicals such as styrene epoxy and solvent fumes which may cause health problems if not used carefully in  she created a series of sculptures protesting stereotypical societal roles for women as child bearers devouring mothers witches and prostitutes some of her early artworks from this bride period depicted ghostly skeletal brides dressed in white which have been compared to miss havisham an ethereal character in charles dickens novel great expectations over time these figures became more joyful whimsical colorful and larger in scale inspired by a collaborative drawing with american artist larry rivers of his wife her pregnant friend clarice price saint phalle began to portray archetypal female figures with a more optimistic view of the position of women in society the newer figures took on ecstatic dance poses and even acrobatic positions such as handstands and cartwheels saint phalles lighthearted figures have been compared to the joyful dancers of matisse and the sturdy female figures by gaston lachaise aristide maillol and rodin by  she was calling her artistic expressions of the proverbial everywoman nanas after a french slang word that is roughly equivalent to broad or chick the first of these freelyposed forms—made of papiermâché yarn and cloth—were exhibited at the alexander iolas gallery in paris in september  for this show iolas published saint phalles first artist book that included her handwritten text in combination with her drawings of bananas during this show she joined a type of tombola raffle organized by the artists club of new york whereby artworks were randomly left in coinoperated luggage lockers at pennsylvania station and keys were offered for  each encouraged by iolas she started a highly productive output of graphic work that accompanied exhibitions which included silkscreened prints posters books and writings in  saint phalle collaborated with jean tinguely and per olof ultvedt sv on a temporary indoor sculpture installation honen katedral also spelled honenkatedrall which literally means sheacathedral in swedish filling a large space in the moderna museet in stockholm sweden during construction saint phalle recruited swiss art student rico weber de who had been working as a dishwasher in the museum restaurant in the following years he would become an important assistant and collaborator for both saint phalle and tinguely a team of  people worked strenuously for  days first building a frame using metal rebar covering it with chicken wire sheathing it with fabric attached with a smelly animal glue and then painting the inside of the enclosure black and covering the outside in bright colors the final structure was  feet  m long and  feet  m wide weighing around  tonnes  kg the outer form was a giant reclining sculpture of a pregnant woman a nana whose internal body cavity could be entered through a doorsized vaginal opening between her legs written on one of hons massive thighs was the motto honi soit qui mal y pense shamed be he who evil of it thinks inside the massive sculpture were a seat cinema theater a milk bar inside a breast a fish pond and a brain built by tinguely with moving mechanical parts in addition the sprawling nana contained a coin telephone a loveseat sofa a museum of fake paintings a sandwich vending machine an art installation by ultvedt and a playground slide for children after an initial shocked silence the installation elicited immense public commentary in magazines and newspapers throughout the world raising awareness of the moderna museet over  visitors crowded in to experience the immersive environment including many children at the end of  months the entire temporary setup was demolished and removed except for the head which was preserved by the museum in its permanent collection some small fragments were attached to limitededition exhibition catalogs and sold as mementos around this time saint phalle also designed stage sets and costumes for theatrical productions éloge de la folie praise of the madness  a ballet by roland petit an adaptation of the aristophanes play lysistrata  and a germanlanguage play she cowrote with rainer von diez titled ich all about me  large fixed or moveable nana figures were prominent in several of these productions in  saint phalle began working with polyester resin a material which could be shaped easily but would transform into a hard smooth weatherresistant surface this new technology enabled her to construct enormous fantastical figures for display outdoors in public spaces and parks the material is reasonably durable outdoors similar materials are used for boats and car bodies though decades of weather exposure would eventually cause deterioration requiring art conservation measures in  she exhibited le paradis fantastique the fantastic paradise a collaborative grouping of  of her sculptures with  machines built by tinguely on the rooftop terrace of the level french pavilion at expo  in montreal the composition was originally conceived of as an attack by tinguelys dark mechanical constructions upon saint phalles brightlycolored animals and female figures a kind of amorous warfare although the french pavilion itself was popular most visitors did not see the rooftop terrace where the sculptures were installed in  the sculptures were redisplayed at the albrightknox gallery in buffalo new york and in new york central park in  some of the artworks were purchased by the moderna museet in stockholm sweden and permanently installed in an outdoors sculpture garden in  she first disclosed that she had developed respiratory problems from exposure to dust and fumes in making her artwork starting in  saint phalle sold nana inflatable pool toys amid criticism from the art world she ignored the complaints focusing on raising money for her future monumental projects in the coming years she would face more criticism for overcommercializing and popularizing her artwork but she raised significant funding that enabled her to finance several ambitious projects on her own over the years she produced clothing jewelry perfume glass or porcelain figures furniture and craft items many with a nana theme from  she worked on her first fullscale architecture project three small sculptural houses for rainer von diez in southern france which she called le rêve de loiseau fr the dream of the bird the project was a collaboration with him and jean tinguely and a forerunner of her later tarot garden project that same year she joined several other artists under the lead of tinguely starting work on le cyclop also known as la tête meaning the head or le monstre dans la forêt meaning the monster in the forest in millylaforêt near paris collaborators included daniel spoerri bernhard luginbuhl and eva aeppli eventually  different people worked on the project which would not be considered finished until  in november  as part of an artists reunion celebrating the th anniversary of the founding of the nouveaux réalistes saint phalle shot at an altar assemblage on  july  saint phalle and tinguely legally became married though the immediate reason may have been tax savings as saint phalle thus became a swiss citizen their marriage did give the two artists mutual control over each others artistic estate if one of them should die that same year she designed her first pieces of jewelry in  she installed golem commissioned by the then mayor teddy kollek at a childrens playground in the kiryat hayovel neighborhood of jerusalem it is a giant monster with three red tongues protruding from its mouth which serve as playground slides starting in  she engaged robert haligon fabricant de plastiques d’art to help fabricate her largescale sculptures as well as multiple editions of artworks this collaboration would continue for many years including both his sons notably gérard who would take the lead in later years in  saint phalle shot footage for the surreal horror film daddy about a deeply troubled fatherdaughter lovehate relationship the filming was done in a rented castle near grasse in southeastern france in association with filmmaker peter whitehead in november the film was shown in london the following january she produced a new version of the film with additional scenes in soisy and in new york and an expanded cast the revised version premiered at lincoln center for the th new york film festival in april she was also commissioned to design the cover of the program for the festival saint phalle continued to create nanas for the rest of her life but would soon focus her attention on a comprehensive project in italy le paradis fantastique  stravinsky fountain  tarot garden edit main article tarot garden “ the tarot garden is not just my garden it is also the garden of all those who helped me make it i am the architect of the garden i imposed my vision because i could not do otherwise the garden was made with difficulties wild enthusiasm obsession and most of all faith nothing could have stopped me as in all fairy tales before finding the treasure i met on my path dragons sorcerors magicians and the angel of temperance —niki de saint phalle ” in  saint phalle had visited antoni gaudís parc güell in barcelona spain which inspired her to use diverse materials and found objects as essential elements in her art another influence was the parco dei mostri in bomarzo in the tuscany region of italy in the late s she and jean tinguely had visited le palais idéal built by ferdinand cheval in hauterives france as well as simon rodia’s watts towers in los angeles in the early s both locations were examples of fantastical outsider art and architecture built by ordinary working men of modest means but expansive vision saint phalle decided that she wanted to make something similar a monumental sculpture garden but created by a woman the initial sponsors for her ambitious project were members of the italian agnelli family in  saint phalle became ill with a pulmonary abscess from her work with polyester and was hospitalized in arizona she then recuperated in st moritz switzerland she reconnected with marella caracciolo agnelli a friend from the s in new york and told agnelli about her ideas for a fantasy garden in  agnellis brothers carlo and nicola caracciolo offered a parcel of their land in tuscany for the gardens site in  saint phalle wrote the screenplay for un rêve plus long que la nuit a dream longer than the night later also called camélia et le dragon and she recruited many of her artist friends to help make it into a film a phantasmagorical tale of dragons monsters and adolescence a young girl is held captive by a dragon manages to escape and must explore sept portes du mystère seven doors of mystery to find love saint phalles daughter laura was the lead character in the film appearing with saint phalle jean tinguely and other artist friends peter whitehead composed the music for the filming she designed several pieces of furniture which were later displayed on the facade of the palais des beauxarts fine arts palace in brussels from  she also worked on last night i had a dream a sculptural relief painting that included many elements from her earlier life and dreams in  she retreated to the swiss alps to refine her plans for the sculpture park in  ricardo menon became her assistant working closely with her until  in  she worked with the english writer constantin mulgrave to design sets for the traveling companion based on a hans christian andersen fairy tale but the project was never completed she and mulgrave lived together for around four years but tinguely remained a constantly reappearing presence in her life in  she also visited mexico and new mexico in search of wider artistic inspirations in  saint phalle started to lay out her sculpture garden in an abandoned quarry in garavicchio tuscany about  kilometres  mi northwest of rome along the coast the following year sites were cleared and foundations were established in  she produced the first of what would become a new series of sculptures the skinnies these were flat planar seethrough outlines of heads and figures highlighted by patches of color in some ways they resembled her colorful sketches and drawings but scaled up to monumental size she also continued to produce her nanas in addition to her new style of sculpture both styles of figures would appear in her tarot garden project in  saint phalle and her team began to build the first architectural sculpture in the garden as the project progressed saint phalle started taking lessons in the italian language to better communicate with local workers the second crew member she hired was ugo celletti a yearold parttime postal delivery man who discovered a love for mosaic work on the project he would work on the project for  years and recruit his nephews to join in some family members are still involved in maintaining the site she invited artist friends from argentina scotland holland and france to help work on the sculptures over time saint phalle worked with dozens of people including architects ceramicists iron workers brick layers painters and mosaic artists the materials used in the tarot garden project would include steel iron cement polyester ceramic mosaic glass mirrors and polished stones which she called mms the structure of the larger sculptures was very similar to the temporary hon installation at the moderna museet in  but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the longterm weathering effects of sun and rain the basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar a second layer of lightergauge steel reinforcement bars was added followed by two layers of expanded metal a specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure a layer of tar for waterproofing and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy hollow structure ready for decoration in  she also began selling a series of polyester snake chairs vases and lamps that year she recorded her first attack of rheumatoid arthritis a painful disease affecting the joints of the skeleton in  she designed a colorful paint scheme for a piper aerostar  p twinengine airplane which participated in the first transatlantic race sponsored by the peter stuyvesant foundation of amsterdam as an act of playful rebellion against the cigarette manufacturer sponsor she added a no smoking sign visible on the belly of the plane she was allergic to tobacco smoke in  saint phalle rented a small house near the tarot garden and hired young people from garavicchio to help with construction of the garden jean tinguely led a swiss team comprising seppi imhoff and rico weber and started welding the frames of the sculptures the following year dutch artist doc winsen also called dok van winsen took up the welding operations in  she developed and marketed an eponymous perfume using the proceeds to help finance her project the perfume bottle top featured a small sculpture of two intertwined snakes one golden and the other brightly multicolored she may have raised as much as a third of the funds she needed for the garden in this way she actively solicited funding from friends and acquaintances as well as by selling her artworks in  saint phalle collaborated with tinguely to produce the stravinsky fountain a piece sculptural fountain for igor stravinsky square located next to the centre georges pompidou in paris because of its prominent location in paris it would become one of the bestknown collaborations between the two artists from  onwards when on site saint phalle lived in a small apartment built into the empress a housesized sphinxlike sculpture in the garden on the second level her bedroom was inside one breast and her kitchen was inside the other one each of these two rooms had a single recessed circular window appearing as an inverted nipple when viewed from the outside in  she would recall at last my lifelong wish to live inside a sculpture was going to be granted a space entirely made out of undulating curves  i wanted to invent a new mother a mother goddess and be reborn within its form  i would sleep in one breast in the other i would put my kitchen the ground floor contained a large mirrored space with a mirrored dining table where she would serve lunch to workmen and artists beneath a chandelier tinguely had made with a cow skull she used this motherly role to help reinforce her authority in directing the team of men she needed to help build her project eventually she would grow tired of the cramped space in the womb of her mother and after  would move into a newyorkloftstyle studio which she had built for herself underground at the site around  saint phalle decided to cover her tarot garden sculptures primarily in durable ceramic colored tiles adding shards of mirrors and glass and polished stones ricardo menon helped her recruit venera finocchiaro a ceramics teacher from rome she taught local women new techniques for molding ceramic pieces to curved surfaces and installed onsite ovens to finish the pieces starting in  jean tinguely added motorized and stationary steel sculptures and fountains to the project robert haligon and his sons did much of the work which involved polyester resins saint phalle asked pierre marie lejeune to create a cement path which he inscribed with hieroglyphs other signs and symbols and text during this period saint phalle dedicated almost all of her time to living and working at the garden in  ricardo menon left to attend a drama school in paris while there he recruited marcelo zitelli to work for saint phalle as a gardener but he in turn became her assistant for other work as well helping her fabricate sculptures for at least the next decade the same year saint phalle took some time to collaborate with silvio barandun de a german medical professor of immunology in writing and illustrating her book aids you can’t catch it holding hands intended for students in middle school or high school it was first published in san francisco in english then later translated into five different languages  copies were sold or given to medical institutions and schools from  saint phalle spent more of her time in paris where she developed many of the smaller sculptures for the garden from time to time she would organize gallery shows of her art including maquettes of her larger works to raise funds for the garden project saint phalle also worked on establishing a permanent legal structure for the preservation and maintenance of the garden in  she produced a maquette for le temple idéal the ideal temple a place of worship welcoming all religions in response to the religious intolerance she saw while working in jerusalem the city of nîmes france commissioned her to build the architectural sculpture but the project never was built due to politics over the years she had become interested in myths and religious traditions beyond her childhood roman catholic upbringing including jewish hindu buddhist and ancient egyptian beliefs in  remedial maintenance on the tarot garden sculptures was performed using new glues and silicones to attach mirrors and glass elements more securely to withstand weathering and the touch of many visitors hands as of update a similar restoration process of reattaching mirrors is ongoing with le cyclop located in millylaforêt near paris the tarot garden was under development for almost  years and  million roughly  million in  dollars was spent to construct it the foundation of the tarot garden was constituted in  and would attain official juridical status in  and the garden officially opened to the public on  may  the completed garden called il giardino dei tarocchi in italian and le jardin des tarots in french now

freely with many other contemporary artists writers and composers throughout her creative career she collaborated with other wellknown artists such as jasper johns robert rauschenberg larry rivers composer john cage and architect mario botta as well as dozens of lessknown artists and craftspersons for several decades she worked especially closely with swiss kinetic artist jean tinguely who also became her second husband in her later years she suffered from multiple chronic health problems attributed to repeated exposure to glass fibers and petrochemical fumes from the experimental materials she had used in her pioneering artworks but she continued to create prolifically until the end of her life a critic has observed that saint phalles insistence on exuberance emotion and sensuality her pursuit of the figurative and her bold use of color have not endeared her to everyone in a minimalist age she was wellknown in europe but her work was littleseen in the us until her final years in san

temperamental and violent beating the younger children and forcing them to eat even if they were not hungry both elizabeth and richard de saint phalle younger siblings would later commit suicide as

fantastique  an early collaboration of saint phalle and jean tinguely at the age of  saint phalle married harry mathews whom she had first met the age of  he was  through her father six years later they met each other by chance on a train to princeton and soon became a couple initially they had a civil ceremony on  june  in new york city hall at the urging of nikis mother they also had a religious rite at the french church of new york the following february although her parents accepted the union her husbands family objected to her catholic background and cut them off financially causing them to resort to occasional shoplifting they moved to cambridge massachusetts so mathews could study music at harvard university saint phalle began to paint in oils and gouaches but aimed to pursue a career in acting their first child laura was born in april  in  the small family moved to paris where harry continued his studies in conducting at i’ecole normale de musique paris normal school of music the new parents were casual even negligent in their care but their children would benefit from better financial circumstances after mathews received an inheritance saint phalle rejected the staid conservative values of her family which dictated domestic positions for wives and particular strict rules of conduct poet john ashbery recalled that saint phalles artistic pursuits were rejected in turn by relatives her uncle french banker count alexandre de saintphalle  reportedly takes a dim view of her artistic activities ashbery observednote  however after marrying young and becoming a mother she found herself living the same bourgeois lifestyle that she had attempted to escape for about a decade the family would wander around france and europe living a bohemian lifestyle in nice saint phalle and mathews would have separate affairs in  after she attacked her husbands mistress she took an overdose of sleeping pills but they had little effect because she was manic at the time when harry discovered a stash of knives razors and scissors under a mattress he took his wife to a mental clinic in nice where she was treated with electroshock therapy and insulin shock liberated from routine household work she focused on creating artwork instead and improved enough to be discharged in six weeks around the same time her husband abandoned his music studies and started to write his first novel eventually switching to a career in writing while in paris on a modeling assignment in  saint phalle was introduced to the americanfrench painter hugh weiss fr who became both her friend and artistic mentor he encouraged her to continue painting in her selftaught style in september  the small family moved to deià majorca spain where her son philip was born in may  while in spain saint phalle read the works of proust and visited madrid and barcelona where she became deeply affected by the work of architect antoni gaudí gaudís influence opened many previously unimagined possibilities for saint phalle especially with regard to the use of unusual materials and objetstrouvés as structural elements in sculpture and architecture saint phalle was particularly struck by gaudís park güell which would inspire her to one day create her own gardenbased artwork that would combine artistic and natural elements saint phalle continued to paint particularly after she and her family moved to paris in the mids her first art exhibition was held in  in switzerland where she displayed her naïve style of oil painting in  she met the swiss artist jean tinguely and his wife artist eva aeppli saint phalle attempted her first largescale sculpture enlisting tinguely to make an iron armature which she covered with plaster and paint in the late s saint phalle became ill with hyperthyroidism and tachycardia which were eventually treated by an operation in  in  saint phalle first encountered multiple artworks by yves klein marcel duchamp daniel spoerri willem de kooning jackson pollock robert rauschenberg and jasper johns seeing these avantgarde works triggered her first great artistic crisis she switched from oil painting to gouaches and gloss paint and began to produce assemblages from household objects and castoffs by this time she had decided to dedicate herself fully to creating art free from the obligations of everyday family life in  she and harry separated by mutual agreement and her husband moved to another apartment with their two children at that time her daughter laura was  and her son philip was  years old mathews would occasionally buy artworks from his wife as a way of providing her modest support and she would visit him and the children periodically she soon moved in with jean tinguely who by then had separated from his wife eva aeppli he was becoming wellknown for his kinetic sculptures made from castoff mechanisms and junk in many ways the pair were polar opposites and sometimes had violent disagreements and frequent affairs with others they would live together intermittently and collaborate closely on artistic projects for over a decade before marrying in  two years later they separated but remained on good terms and continued to collaborate on various projects up through tinguelys death in  in  tinguely introduced her to pontus hultén then the director of the moderna museet modern museum in stockholm sweden over the next few years he would invite her to participate in important exhibitions and acquire her artworks for the museum he would later become the first director of the centre georges pompidou in paris  where he continued to be influential in promoting wider recognition of saint phalles artwork tirs edit autel dor golden altar  resembles smaller versions of the tirs series but was not shot or paintsplattered saint phalle created a series of works in the early s she called tirs shootings or shots the series began as target pictures with painted bullseye targets prominently displayed within her painted collages such as saint sébastien portrait of my loverportrait of my belovedmartyr nécessaire  or assemblage figure with dartboard head  she would invite viewers to throw darts at the dartboards embedded as faces in her figurative assemblages which were influenced by the targets painted by her friend jasper johns soon she would start by embedding knives razor blades scissors eggbeaters babydoll arms and other household items in plaster covering a large board along with bags filled with colorful paints cans of spray paint and sometimes a tomato in addition she might suspend bags of paint or cans of spray paint in front of the whitepainted assemblage she would then repeatedly shoot the assemblage with a pistol rifle or miniature cannon causing the liquids to bleed or to spray out her first staged public shooting event was in february  attended by jean tinguely daniel spoerri and pierre restany among others as founder of the nouveau réalisme new realist movement restany asked saint phalle to join this group of french artists upon seeing her performance she was the only female member of this group these extreme expressions of violence attracted media attention catapulting saint phalle into the ranks of avantgarde artistic rebellion the tirs combined performance body art sculpture and painting in the artistic ferment of the s saint phalle began to stage variations on this process in art museums and galleries and recruited other artists to join in staged public happenings where some of her colleagues would also pull the trigger she met many other emerging artists through these performances including robert rauschenberg ad reinhardt frank stella and edward kienholz she would also invite gallery visitors to shoot at her assemblages she participated in spoerris edition mat multiplication d’art transformable program of multiple artwork editions supplying simpler versions of her tir works with detailed instructions on how to shoot them with a  rifle saint phalle carefully documented her artistic process in the tirs with writing still photos and films she would attach readymade common artifacts to a board attach bags of colorful paint whitewash everything and then dip the assemblage into milkwhite plaster once it had dried the assemblage was ready for shooting by a purchaser in june  niki de saint phalle and jean tinguely joined jasper johns and robert rauschenberg in a concerthappening called variations ii orchestrated by avantgarde american composer john cage and held at the american embassy in paris while david tudor played cage compositions on the piano the artists created their works of art on stage as the audience watched the proceedings in august  marcel duchamp introduced saint phalle and tinguely to salvador dalí who invited them to create a lifesized exploding bull with fireworks toro de fuego this homenage a dalí homage to dalí was wheeled out after the end of a traditional spanish bullfight in figueras catalonia spain and exploded in front of the audience an exclusive  openair shooting event in the malibu hills above los angeles was attended by hollywood celebrities including jane fonda and john houseman in most of these public performances saint phalle was impeccably dressed in a fashionable white pantsuit by  she had taken the series to galleries in new york city and los angeles inviting the public to participate in the shootings in los angeles she shot a largescale king kong assemblage she had constructed paintspattering the embedded sculpted faces of politicians such as john f kennedy fidel castro and charles de gaulle with santa claus and donald duck as well this work would later be acquired by the moderna museet in stockholm and would mark her transition to a new series of fantastic monsters animals and female figures throughout her career snakes birds and dragons would become recurring symbols in her artworks in  saint phalle and tinguely purchased an old hotel called auberge au cheval blanc white horse inn in soisysurecole it had previously been a brothel but the new owners converted it into artistic studios which they would share over the decades to come nanas edit gwendolyn  le poète et sa muse poet and his muse  blue nana  a nana a black nana saint phalle next explored the various roles of women in what would develop into her bestknown and most prolific series of sculptures she started making lifesize dolls of women such as brides and mothers giving birth monsters and large heads initially they were made of soft materials such as wool cloth and papiermâché but they soon evolved into plaster over a wire framework and plastic toys some painted all white as the series developed into larger monumental works saint phalle used composite fiberglassreinforced polyester plastic also known as frp or grp decorated with multiple brightcolored acrylic or polyester paints she also used polyurethane foam in many of her sculptures these innovative materials enabled the construction of colorful largescale sculptures with a new ease and fluidity of form however the fabrication and painting processes can release large numbers of glass fibers and chemicals such as styrene epoxy and solvent fumes which may cause health problems if not used carefully in  she created a series of sculptures protesting stereotypical societal roles for women as child bearers devouring mothers witches and prostitutes some of her early artworks from this bride period depicted ghostly skeletal brides dressed in white which have been compared to miss havisham an ethereal character in charles dickens novel great expectations over time these figures became more joyful whimsical colorful and larger in scale inspired by a collaborative drawing with american artist larry rivers of his wife her pregnant friend clarice price saint phalle began to portray archetypal female figures with a more optimistic view of the position of women in society the newer figures took on ecstatic dance poses and even acrobatic positions such as handstands and cartwheels saint phalles lighthearted figures have been compared to the joyful dancers of matisse and the sturdy female figures by gaston lachaise aristide maillol and rodin by  she was calling her artistic expressions of the proverbial everywoman nanas after a french slang word that is roughly equivalent to broad or chick the first of these freelyposed forms—made of papiermâché yarn and cloth—were exhibited at the alexander iolas gallery in paris in september  for this show iolas published saint phalles first artist book that included her handwritten text in combination with her drawings of bananas during this show she joined a type of tombola raffle organized by the artists club of new york whereby artworks were randomly left in coinoperated luggage lockers at pennsylvania station and keys were offered for  each encouraged by iolas she started a highly productive output of graphic work that accompanied exhibitions which included silkscreened prints posters books and writings in  saint phalle collaborated with jean tinguely and per olof ultvedt sv on a temporary indoor sculpture installation honen katedral also spelled honenkatedrall which literally means sheacathedral in swedish filling a large space in the moderna museet in stockholm sweden during construction saint phalle recruited swiss art student rico weber de who had been working as a dishwasher in the museum restaurant in the following years he would become an important assistant and collaborator for both saint phalle and tinguely a team of  people worked strenuously for  days first building a frame using metal rebar covering it with chicken wire sheathing it with fabric attached with a smelly animal glue and then painting the inside of the enclosure black and covering the outside in bright colors the final structure was  feet  m long and  feet  m wide weighing around  tonnes  kg the outer form was a giant reclining sculpture of a pregnant woman a nana whose internal body cavity could be entered through a doorsized vaginal opening between her legs written on one of hons massive thighs was the motto honi soit qui mal y pense shamed be he who evil of it thinks inside the massive sculpture were a seat cinema theater a milk bar inside a breast a fish pond and a brain built by tinguely with moving mechanical parts in addition the sprawling nana contained a coin telephone a loveseat sofa a museum of fake paintings a sandwich vending machine an art installation by ultvedt and a playground slide for children after an initial shocked silence the installation elicited immense public commentary in magazines and newspapers throughout the world raising awareness of the moderna museet over  visitors crowded in to experience the immersive environment including many children at the end of  months the entire temporary setup was demolished and removed except for the head which was preserved by the museum in its permanent collection some small fragments were attached to limitededition exhibition catalogs and sold as mementos around this time saint phalle also designed stage sets and costumes for theatrical productions éloge de la folie praise of the madness  a ballet by roland petit an adaptation of the aristophanes play lysistrata  and a germanlanguage play she cowrote with rainer von diez titled ich all about me  large fixed or moveable nana figures were prominent in several of these productions in  saint phalle began working with polyester resin a material which could be shaped easily but would transform into a hard smooth weatherresistant surface this new technology enabled her to construct enormous fantastical figures for display outdoors in public spaces and parks the material is reasonably durable outdoors similar materials are used for boats and car bodies though decades of weather exposure would eventually cause deterioration requiring art conservation measures in  she exhibited le paradis fantastique the fantastic paradise a collaborative grouping of  of her sculptures with  machines built by tinguely on the rooftop terrace of the level french pavilion at expo  in montreal the composition was originally conceived of as an attack by tinguelys dark mechanical constructions upon saint phalles brightlycolored animals and female figures a kind of amorous warfare although the french pavilion itself was popular most visitors did not see the rooftop terrace where the sculptures were installed in  the sculptures were redisplayed at the albrightknox gallery in buffalo new york and in new york central park in  some of the artworks were purchased by the moderna museet in stockholm sweden and permanently installed in an outdoors sculpture garden in  she first disclosed that she had developed respiratory problems from exposure to dust and fumes in making her artwork starting in  saint phalle sold nana inflatable pool toys amid criticism from the art world she ignored the complaints focusing on raising money for her future monumental projects in the coming years she would face more criticism for overcommercializing and popularizing her artwork but she raised significant funding that enabled her to finance several ambitious projects on her own over the years she produced clothing jewelry perfume glass or porcelain figures furniture and craft items many with a nana theme from  she worked on her first fullscale architecture project three small sculptural houses for rainer von diez in southern france which she called le rêve de loiseau fr the dream of the bird the project was a collaboration with him and jean tinguely and a forerunner of her later tarot garden project that same year she joined several other artists under the lead of tinguely starting work on le cyclop also known as la tête meaning the head or le monstre dans la forêt meaning the monster in the forest in millylaforêt near paris collaborators included daniel spoerri bernhard luginbuhl and eva aeppli eventually  different people worked on the project which would not be considered finished until  in november  as part of an artists reunion celebrating the th anniversary of the founding of the nouveaux réalistes saint phalle shot at an altar assemblage on  july  saint phalle and tinguely legally became married though the immediate reason may have been tax savings as saint phalle thus became a swiss citizen their marriage did give the two artists mutual control over each others artistic estate if one of them should die that same year she designed her first pieces of jewelry in  she installed golem commissioned by the then mayor teddy kollek at a childrens playground in the kiryat hayovel neighborhood of jerusalem it is a giant monster with three red tongues protruding from its mouth which serve as playground slides starting in  she engaged robert haligon fabricant de plastiques d’art to help fabricate her largescale sculptures as well as multiple editions of artworks this collaboration would continue for many years including both his sons notably gérard who would take the lead in later years in  saint phalle shot footage for the surreal horror film daddy about a deeply troubled fatherdaughter lovehate relationship the filming was done in a rented castle near grasse in southeastern france in association with filmmaker peter whitehead in november the film was shown in london the following january she produced a new version of the film with additional scenes in soisy and in new york and an expanded cast the revised version premiered at lincoln center for the th new york film festival in april she was also commissioned to design the cover of the program for the festival saint phalle continued to create nanas for the rest of her life but would soon focus her attention on a comprehensive project in italy le paradis fantastique  stravinsky fountain  tarot garden edit main article tarot garden “ the tarot garden is not just my garden it is also the garden of all those who helped me make it i am the architect of the garden i imposed my vision because i could not do otherwise the garden was made with difficulties wild enthusiasm obsession and most of all faith nothing could have stopped me as in all fairy tales before finding the treasure i met on my path dragons sorcerors magicians and the angel of temperance —niki de saint phalle ” in  saint phalle had visited antoni gaudís parc güell in barcelona spain which inspired her to use diverse materials and found objects as essential elements in her art another influence was the parco dei mostri in bomarzo in the tuscany region of italy in the late s she and jean tinguely had visited le palais idéal built by ferdinand cheval in hauterives france as well as simon rodia’s watts towers in los angeles in the early s both locations were examples of fantastical outsider art and architecture built by ordinary working men of modest means but expansive vision saint phalle decided that she wanted to make something similar a monumental sculpture garden but created by a woman the initial sponsors for her ambitious project were members of the italian agnelli family in  saint phalle became ill with a pulmonary abscess from her work with polyester and was hospitalized in arizona she then recuperated in st moritz switzerland she reconnected with marella caracciolo agnelli a friend from the s in new york and told agnelli about her ideas for a fantasy garden in  agnellis brothers carlo and nicola caracciolo offered a parcel of their land in tuscany for the gardens site in  saint phalle wrote the screenplay for un rêve plus long que la nuit a dream longer than the night later also called camélia et le dragon and she recruited many of her artist friends to help make it into a film a phantasmagorical tale of dragons monsters and adolescence a young girl is held captive by a dragon manages to escape and must explore sept portes du mystère seven doors of mystery to find love saint phalles daughter laura was the lead character in the film appearing with saint phalle jean tinguely and other artist friends peter whitehead composed the music for the filming she designed several pieces of furniture which were later displayed on the facade of the palais des beauxarts fine arts palace in brussels from  she also worked on last night i had a dream a sculptural relief painting that included many elements from her earlier life and dreams in  she retreated to the swiss alps to refine her plans for the sculpture park in  ricardo menon became her assistant working closely with her until  in  she worked with the english writer constantin mulgrave to design sets for the traveling companion based on a hans christian andersen fairy tale but the project was never completed she and mulgrave lived together for around four years but tinguely remained a constantly reappearing presence in her life in  she also visited mexico and new mexico in search of wider artistic inspirations in  saint phalle started to lay out her sculpture garden in an abandoned quarry in garavicchio tuscany about  kilometres  mi northwest of rome along the coast the following year sites were cleared and foundations were established in  she produced the first of what would become a new series of sculptures the skinnies these were flat planar seethrough outlines of heads and figures highlighted by patches of color in some ways they resembled her colorful sketches and drawings but scaled up to monumental size she also continued to produce her nanas in addition to her new style of sculpture both styles of figures would appear in her tarot garden project in  saint phalle and her team began to build the first architectural sculpture in the garden as the project progressed saint phalle started taking lessons in the italian language to better communicate with local workers the second crew member she hired was ugo celletti a yearold parttime postal delivery man who discovered a love for mosaic work on the project he would work on the project for  years and recruit his nephews to join in some family members are still involved in maintaining the site she invited artist friends from argentina scotland holland and france to help work on the sculptures over time saint phalle worked with dozens of people including architects ceramicists iron workers brick layers painters and mosaic artists the materials used in the tarot garden project would include steel iron cement polyester ceramic mosaic glass mirrors and polished stones which she called mms the structure of the larger sculptures was very similar to the temporary hon installation at the moderna museet in  but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the longterm weathering effects of sun and rain the basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar a second layer of lightergauge steel reinforcement bars was added followed by two layers of expanded metal a specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure a layer of tar for waterproofing and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy hollow structure ready for decoration in  she also began selling a series of polyester snake chairs vases and lamps that year she recorded her first attack of rheumatoid arthritis a painful disease affecting the joints of the skeleton in  she designed a colorful paint scheme for a piper aerostar  p twinengine airplane which participated in the first transatlantic race sponsored by the peter stuyvesant foundation of amsterdam as an act of playful rebellion against the cigarette manufacturer sponsor she added a no smoking sign visible on the belly of the plane she was allergic to tobacco smoke in  saint phalle rented a small house near the tarot garden and hired young people from garavicchio to help with construction of the garden jean tinguely led a swiss team comprising seppi imhoff and rico weber and started welding the frames of the sculptures the following year dutch artist doc winsen also called dok van winsen took up the welding operations in  she developed and marketed an eponymous perfume using the proceeds to help finance her project the perfume bottle top featured a small sculpture of two intertwined snakes one golden and the other brightly multicolored she may have raised as much as a third of the funds she needed for the garden in this way she actively solicited funding from friends and acquaintances as well as by selling her artworks in  saint phalle collaborated with tinguely to produce the stravinsky fountain a piece sculptural fountain for igor stravinsky square located next to the centre georges pompidou in paris because of its prominent location in paris it would become one of the bestknown collaborations between the two artists from  onwards when on site saint phalle lived in a small apartment built into the empress a housesized sphinxlike sculpture in the garden on the second level her bedroom was inside one breast and her kitchen was inside the other one each of these two rooms had a single recessed circular window appearing as an inverted nipple when viewed from the outside in  she would recall at last my lifelong wish to live inside a sculpture was going to be granted a space entirely made out of undulating curves  i wanted to invent a new mother a mother goddess and be reborn within its form  i would sleep in one breast in the other i would put my kitchen the ground floor contained a large mirrored space with a mirrored dining table where she would serve lunch to workmen and artists beneath a chandelier tinguely had made with a cow skull she used this motherly role to help reinforce her authority in directing the team of men she needed to help build her project eventually she would grow tired of the cramped space in the womb of her mother and after  would move into a newyorkloftstyle studio which she had built for herself underground at the site around  saint phalle decided to cover her tarot garden sculptures primarily in durable ceramic colored tiles adding shards of mirrors and glass and polished stones ricardo menon helped her recruit venera finocchiaro a ceramics teacher from rome she taught local women new techniques for molding ceramic pieces to curved surfaces and installed onsite ovens to finish the pieces starting in  jean tinguely added motorized and stationary steel sculptures and fountains to the project robert haligon and his sons did much of the work which involved polyester resins saint phalle asked pierre marie lejeune to create a cement path which he inscribed with hieroglyphs other signs and symbols and text during this period saint phalle dedicated almost all of her time to living and working at the garden in  ricardo menon left to attend a drama school in paris while there he recruited marcelo zitelli to work for saint phalle as a gardener but he in turn became her assistant for other work as well helping her fabricate sculptures for at least the next decade the same year saint phalle took some time to collaborate with silvio barandun de a german medical professor of immunology in writing and illustrating her book aids you can’t catch it holding hands intended for students in middle school or high school it was first published in san francisco in english then later translated into five different languages  copies were sold or given to medical institutions and schools from  saint phalle spent more of her time in paris where she developed many of the smaller sculptures for the garden from time to time she would organize gallery shows of her art including maquettes of her larger works to raise funds for the garden project saint phalle also worked on establishing a permanent legal structure for the preservation and maintenance of the garden in  she produced a maquette for le temple idéal the ideal temple a place of worship welcoming all religions in response to the religious intolerance she saw while working in jerusalem the city of nîmes france commissioned her to build the architectural sculpture but the project never was built due to politics over the years she had become interested in myths and religious traditions beyond her childhood roman catholic upbringing including jewish hindu buddhist and ancient egyptian beliefs in  remedial maintenance on the tarot garden sculptures was performed using new glues and silicones to attach mirrors and glass elements more securely to withstand weathering and the touch of many visitors hands as of update a similar restoration process of reattaching mirrors is ongoing with le cyclop located in millylaforêt near paris the tarot garden was under development for almost  years and  million roughly  million in  dollars was spent to construct it the foundation of the tarot garden was constituted in  and would

hoffman carla descargues pierre con restany pierre inta beautiful and celebratory book on the works of niki de saint phalle  this expanded and updated edition is made distinctly personal by the artists own handwritten comments and whimsical sketches when niki de saint phalle died the world lost not only an artist of enormous passion but also a remarkably creative woman whose work and life were inextricably linked throughout her fortyyear career saint phalle explored female roles in society and myth basing many of her disquieting and joyful depictions on personal experience the full range of saint phalle s oeuvre is paid glorious tribute in this retrospective volume which also features new images and an extended biography chronologically arranged this updated book takes readers from the visceral and controversial shooting paintings and her playfully voluptuous nanas to the impressive installations and wonderfully elaborate sculpture gardens such as the tarot garden in tuscany the sun god in san diego and the stravinsky fountain in paris in addition to nearly a hundred color and black and white photographs of saint phalle s work the artist s own comments and sketches are interspersed throughout the book providing an integral framework for understanding and appreciating her unusual talentindividual artistcondition hpb condition ratingsnew item is brand new

where she became deeply affected by the work of architect antoni gaudí gaudís influence opened many previously unimagined possibilities for saint phalle especially with regard to the use of unusual materials and objetstrouvés as structural elements in sculpture and architecture saint phalle was particularly struck by gaudís park güell which would inspire her to one day create her own gardenbased artwork that would combine artistic and natural elements saint phalle continued to paint particularly after she and her family moved to paris in the mids her first art exhibition was held in  in

recognition of saint phalles artwork tirs edit autel dor golden altar  resembles smaller versions of the tirs series but was not shot or paintsplattered saint phalle created a series of works in the early s she called tirs shootings or shots the series began as target pictures with painted bullseye targets prominently displayed within her painted collages such as saint sébastien portrait of my loverportrait of my belovedmartyr nécessaire  or assemblage figure with dartboard head  she would invite viewers to throw darts at the dartboards embedded as faces in her figurative assemblages which were influenced by the targets painted by her friend jasper johns soon she would start by embedding knives razor blades scissors eggbeaters babydoll arms and other household items in plaster covering a large board along with bags filled with colorful paints cans of spray paint and sometimes a tomato in addition she might suspend bags of paint or cans of spray paint in front of the whitepainted assemblage she would then repeatedly shoot the assemblage with a pistol rifle or miniature cannon causing the liquids to bleed or to spray out her first staged public shooting event was in february  attended by jean tinguely daniel spoerri and pierre restany among others as founder of the nouveau réalisme new realist movement restany asked saint phalle to join this group of french artists upon seeing her performance she was the only female member of this group these extreme expressions of violence attracted media attention catapulting saint phalle into the ranks of avantgarde artistic rebellion the tirs combined performance body art sculpture and painting in the artistic ferment of the s saint phalle began to stage variations on this process in art museums and galleries and recruited other artists to join in staged public happenings where some of her colleagues would also pull the trigger she met many other emerging artists through these performances including robert rauschenberg ad reinhardt frank stella and edward kienholz she would also invite gallery visitors to shoot at her assemblages she participated in spoerris edition mat multiplication d’art transformable program of multiple artwork editions supplying simpler versions of her tir works with detailed instructions on how to shoot them with a  rifle saint phalle carefully documented her artistic process in the tirs with writing still photos and films she would attach readymade common artifacts to a board attach bags of colorful paint whitewash everything and then dip the assemblage into milkwhite plaster once it had dried the assemblage was ready for shooting by a purchaser in june  niki de saint phalle and jean tinguely joined jasper johns and robert rauschenberg in a concerthappening called variations ii orchestrated by avantgarde american composer john cage and held at the american embassy in paris while david tudor played cage compositions on the piano the artists created their works of art on stage as the audience watched the proceedings in august  marcel duchamp introduced saint phalle and tinguely to salvador dalí who invited them to create a lifesized exploding bull with fireworks toro de fuego this homenage a dalí homage to dalí was wheeled out after the end of a traditional spanish bullfight in figueras catalonia spain and exploded in front of the audience an exclusive  openair shooting event in the malibu hills above los angeles was attended by hollywood celebrities including jane fonda and john houseman in most of these public performances saint phalle was impeccably dressed in a fashionable white pantsuit by  she had taken the series to galleries in new york city and los angeles inviting the public to participate in the shootings in los angeles she shot a largescale king kong assemblage she had constructed paintspattering the embedded sculpted faces of politicians such as john f kennedy fidel castro and charles de gaulle with santa claus and donald duck as well this work would later be acquired by the moderna museet in stockholm and would mark her transition to a new series of fantastic monsters animals and female figures throughout her career snakes birds and dragons would become recurring symbols in her artworks in  saint phalle and tinguely purchased an old hotel called auberge au cheval blanc white horse inn in soisysurecole it had previously been a brothel but the new owners converted it into artistic studios which they would share over the decades to come nanas edit gwendolyn  le poète et sa muse poet and his muse  blue nana  a nana a black nana saint phalle next explored the various roles of women in what would develop into her bestknown and most prolific series of sculptures she started making lifesize dolls of women such as brides and mothers giving birth monsters and large heads initially they were made of soft materials such as wool cloth and papiermâché but they soon evolved into plaster over a wire framework and plastic toys some painted all white as the series developed into larger monumental works saint phalle used composite fiberglassreinforced polyester plastic also known as frp or grp decorated with multiple brightcolored acrylic or polyester paints she also used polyurethane foam in many of her sculptures these innovative materials enabled the construction of colorful largescale sculptures with a new ease and fluidity of form however the fabrication and painting processes can release large numbers of glass fibers and chemicals such as styrene epoxy and solvent fumes which may cause health problems if not used carefully in  she created a series of sculptures protesting stereotypical societal roles for women as child bearers devouring mothers witches and prostitutes some of her early artworks from this bride period depicted ghostly skeletal brides dressed in white which have been compared to miss havisham an ethereal character in charles dickens novel great expectations over time these figures became more joyful whimsical colorful and larger in scale inspired by a collaborative drawing with american artist larry rivers of his wife her pregnant friend clarice price saint phalle began to portray archetypal female figures with a more optimistic view of the position of women in society the newer figures took on ecstatic dance poses and even acrobatic positions such as handstands and cartwheels saint phalles lighthearted figures have been compared to the joyful dancers of matisse and the sturdy female figures by gaston lachaise aristide maillol and rodin by  she was calling her artistic expressions of the proverbial everywoman nanas after a french slang word that is roughly equivalent to broad or chick the first of these freelyposed forms—made of papiermâché yarn and cloth—were exhibited at the alexander iolas gallery in paris in september  for this show iolas published saint phalles first artist book that included her handwritten text in combination with her drawings of bananas during this show she joined a type of tombola raffle organized by the artists club of new york whereby artworks were randomly left in coinoperated luggage lockers at pennsylvania station and keys were offered for  each encouraged by iolas she started a highly productive output of graphic work that accompanied exhibitions which included silkscreened prints posters books and writings in  saint phalle collaborated with jean tinguely and per olof ultvedt sv on a temporary indoor sculpture installation honen katedral also spelled honenkatedrall which literally means sheacathedral in swedish filling a large space in the moderna museet in stockholm sweden during construction saint phalle recruited swiss art student rico weber de who had been working as a dishwasher in the museum restaurant in the following years he would become an important assistant and collaborator for both saint phalle and tinguely a team of  people worked strenuously for  days first building a frame using metal rebar covering it with chicken wire sheathing it with fabric attached with a smelly animal glue and then painting the inside of the enclosure black and covering the outside in bright colors the final structure was  feet  m long and  feet  m wide weighing around  tonnes  kg the outer form was a giant reclining sculpture of a pregnant woman a nana whose internal body cavity could be entered through a doorsized vaginal opening between her legs written on one of hons massive thighs was the motto honi soit qui mal y pense shamed be he who evil of it thinks inside the massive sculpture were a seat cinema theater a milk bar inside a breast a fish pond and a brain built by tinguely with moving mechanical parts in addition the sprawling nana contained a coin telephone a loveseat sofa a museum of fake paintings a sandwich vending machine an art installation by ultvedt and a playground slide for children after an initial shocked silence the installation elicited immense public commentary in magazines and newspapers throughout the world raising awareness of the moderna museet over  visitors crowded in to experience the immersive environment including many children at the end of  months the entire temporary setup was demolished and removed except for the head which was preserved by the museum in its permanent collection some small fragments were attached to limitededition exhibition catalogs and sold as mementos around this time saint phalle also designed stage sets and costumes for theatrical productions éloge de la folie praise of the madness  a ballet by roland petit an adaptation of the aristophanes play lysistrata  and a germanlanguage play she cowrote with rainer von diez titled ich all about me  large fixed or moveable nana figures were prominent in several of these productions in  saint phalle began working with polyester resin a material which could be shaped easily but would transform into a hard smooth weatherresistant surface this new technology enabled her to construct enormous fantastical figures for display outdoors in public spaces and parks the material is reasonably durable outdoors similar materials are used for boats and car bodies though decades of weather exposure would eventually cause deterioration requiring art conservation measures in  she exhibited le paradis fantastique the fantastic paradise a collaborative grouping of  of her sculptures with  machines built by tinguely on the rooftop terrace of the level french pavilion at expo  in montreal the composition was originally conceived of as an attack by tinguelys dark mechanical constructions upon saint phalles brightlycolored animals and female figures a kind of amorous warfare although the french pavilion itself was popular most visitors did not see the rooftop terrace where the sculptures were installed in  the sculptures were redisplayed at the albrightknox gallery in buffalo new york and in new york central park in  some of the artworks were purchased by the moderna museet in stockholm sweden and permanently installed in an outdoors sculpture garden in  she first disclosed that she had developed respiratory problems from exposure to dust and fumes in making her artwork starting in  saint phalle sold nana inflatable pool toys amid criticism from the art world she ignored the complaints focusing on raising money for her future monumental projects in the coming years she would face more criticism for overcommercializing and popularizing her artwork but she raised significant funding that enabled her to finance several ambitious projects on her own over the years she produced clothing jewelry perfume glass or porcelain figures furniture and craft items many with a nana theme from  she worked on her first fullscale architecture project three small sculptural houses for rainer von diez in southern france which she called le rêve de loiseau fr the dream of the bird the project was a collaboration with him and jean tinguely and a forerunner of her later tarot garden project that same year she joined several other artists under the lead of tinguely starting work on le cyclop also known as la tête meaning the head or le monstre dans la forêt meaning the monster in the forest in millylaforêt near paris collaborators included daniel spoerri bernhard luginbuhl and eva aeppli eventually  different people worked on the project which would not be considered finished until  in november  as part of an artists reunion celebrating the th anniversary of the founding of the nouveaux réalistes saint phalle shot at an altar assemblage on  july  saint phalle and tinguely legally became married though the immediate reason may have been tax savings as saint phalle thus became a swiss citizen their marriage did give the two artists mutual control over each others artistic estate if one of them should die that same year she designed her first pieces of jewelry in  she installed golem commissioned by the then mayor teddy kollek at a childrens playground in the kiryat hayovel neighborhood of jerusalem it is a giant monster with three red tongues protruding from its mouth which serve as playground slides starting in  she engaged robert haligon fabricant de plastiques d’art to help fabricate her largescale sculptures as well as multiple editions of artworks this collaboration would continue for many years including both his sons notably gérard who would take the lead in later years in  saint phalle shot footage for the surreal horror film daddy about a deeply troubled fatherdaughter lovehate relationship the filming was done in a rented castle near grasse in southeastern france in association with filmmaker peter

of her life but would soon focus her attention on a comprehensive project in italy le paradis fantastique  stravinsky fountain  tarot garden edit main article tarot garden “ the tarot garden is not just my garden it is also the garden of all those who helped me make it i am the architect of the garden i imposed my vision because i could not do otherwise the garden was made with difficulties wild enthusiasm obsession and most of all faith nothing could have stopped me as in all fairy tales before finding the treasure i met on my path dragons sorcerors magicians and the angel of temperance —niki de saint phalle ” in  saint phalle had visited antoni gaudís parc güell in barcelona spain which inspired her to use diverse materials and found objects as essential elements in her art another influence was the parco dei mostri in bomarzo in the tuscany region of italy in the late s she and jean tinguely had visited le palais idéal built by ferdinand cheval in hauterives france as well as simon rodia’s watts towers in los angeles in the early s both locations were examples of fantastical outsider art and architecture built by ordinary working men of modest means but expansive vision saint phalle decided that she wanted to make something similar a monumental sculpture garden but created by a woman the initial sponsors for her ambitious project were members of the italian agnelli family in  saint phalle became ill with a pulmonary abscess from her work with polyester and was hospitalized in arizona she then recuperated in st moritz switzerland she reconnected with marella caracciolo agnelli a friend from the s in new york and told agnelli about her ideas for a fantasy garden in  agnellis brothers carlo and nicola caracciolo offered a parcel of their land in tuscany for the gardens site in  saint phalle wrote the screenplay for un rêve plus long que la nuit a dream longer than the night later also called camélia et le dragon and she recruited many of her artist

assistant working closely with her until  in  she worked with the english writer constantin mulgrave to design sets for the traveling companion based on a hans christian andersen fairy tale but the project was never completed she and mulgrave lived together for around four years but tinguely remained a constantly reappearing presence in her life in  she also visited mexico and new mexico in search of wider artistic inspirations in  saint phalle started to lay out her sculpture garden in an abandoned quarry in garavicchio tuscany about  kilometres  mi northwest of rome along the coast the following year sites were cleared and foundations were established in  she produced the first of what would become a new series of sculptures the skinnies these were flat planar seethrough outlines of heads and figures highlighted by patches of color in some ways they resembled her colorful sketches and drawings but scaled up to monumental size she also continued to produce her nanas in addition to her new style of sculpture both styles of figures would appear in her tarot garden project in  saint phalle and her team began to build the first architectural sculpture in the garden as the project progressed saint phalle started taking lessons in the italian language to better communicate with local workers the second crew member she hired was ugo celletti a yearold parttime postal delivery man who discovered a love for mosaic work on the project he would work on the project for  years and recruit his nephews to join in some family members are still involved in maintaining the site she invited artist friends from argentina scotland holland and france to help work on the sculptures over time saint phalle worked with dozens of people including architects ceramicists iron workers brick layers painters and mosaic artists the materials used in the tarot garden project would include steel iron cement polyester ceramic mosaic glass mirrors and polished stones which she called mms the structure of the larger sculptures was very similar to the temporary hon installation at the moderna museet in  but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the longterm weathering effects of sun and rain the basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar a second layer of lightergauge steel reinforcement bars was added followed by two layers of expanded metal a specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure a layer of tar for waterproofing and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy hollow structure ready for decoration in  she also began selling a series of polyester snake chairs vases and lamps that year she recorded her first attack of rheumatoid arthritis a painful disease affecting the joints of the skeleton in  she designed a colorful paint scheme for a piper aerostar  p twinengine airplane which participated in the first transatlantic race sponsored by the peter stuyvesant foundation of amsterdam as an act of playful rebellion against the cigarette manufacturer sponsor she added a no smoking sign visible on the belly of the plane she was allergic to tobacco smoke in  saint phalle rented a small house near the tarot garden and hired young people from garavicchio to help with construction of the garden jean tinguely led a swiss team comprising seppi imhoff and rico weber and started welding the frames of the sculptures the following year dutch artist doc winsen also called dok van winsen took up the welding operations in  she developed and marketed an eponymous perfume using the proceeds to help finance her project the perfume bottle top featured a small sculpture of two intertwined snakes one golden and the other brightly multicolored she may have raised as much as a third of the funds she needed for the garden in this way she actively solicited funding from friends and acquaintances as well as by selling her artworks in  saint phalle collaborated with tinguely to produce the stravinsky fountain a piece sculptural fountain for igor stravinsky square located next to the centre georges pompidou in paris because of its prominent location in paris it would become one of the bestknown collaborations between the two artists from  onwards when on site saint phalle lived in a small apartment built into the empress a housesized sphinxlike sculpture in the garden on the second level her bedroom was inside one breast and her kitchen was inside the other one each of these two rooms had a single recessed circular window appearing as an inverted nipple when viewed from the outside in  she would recall at last my lifelong wish to live inside a sculpture was going to be granted a space entirely made out of undulating curves  i wanted to invent a new mother a mother goddess and be reborn within its form  i would sleep in one breast in the other i would put my kitchen the ground floor contained a large mirrored space with a mirrored dining table where she would serve lunch to workmen and artists beneath a chandelier tinguely had made with a cow skull she used this motherly role to help reinforce her authority in directing the team of men she needed to help build her project eventually she would grow tired of the cramped space in the womb of her mother and after  would move into a newyorkloftstyle studio which she had built for herself underground at the site around  saint phalle decided to cover her tarot garden sculptures primarily in durable ceramic colored tiles adding shards of mirrors and glass and polished stones ricardo menon helped her recruit venera finocchiaro a ceramics teacher from rome she taught local women new techniques for molding ceramic pieces to curved surfaces and installed onsite ovens to finish the pieces starting in  jean tinguely added motorized and stationary steel sculptures and fountains to the project robert haligon and his sons did much of the work which involved polyester resins saint phalle asked pierre marie lejeune to create a cement path which he inscribed with hieroglyphs other signs and symbols and text during this period saint phalle dedicated almost all of her time to living and working at the garden in  ricardo menon left to attend a drama school in paris while there he recruited marcelo zitelli to work for saint phalle as a gardener but he in turn became her assistant for other work as well helping her fabricate sculptures for at least the next decade the same year saint phalle took some time to collaborate with silvio barandun de a german medical professor of immunology in writing and illustrating her book aids you can’t catch it holding hands intended for students in middle school or high school it was first published in san francisco in

of the smaller sculptures for the garden from time to time she would organize gallery shows of her art including maquettes of her larger works to raise funds for the garden project saint phalle also worked on establishing a permanent legal structure for the preservation and maintenance of the garden in  she produced a maquette for le temple idéal the ideal temple a place of worship welcoming all religions in response to the religious intolerance she saw while working in jerusalem the city of nîmes france commissioned her to build the architectural sculpture but the project never was built due to politics over the years she had become interested in myths and religious traditions beyond her childhood roman catholic upbringing including jewish hindu buddhist and ancient egyptian beliefs in  remedial maintenance on the tarot garden sculptures was performed using new glues and silicones to attach mirrors and glass elements more securely to withstand weathering and the touch of many visitors hands as of update a similar restoration process of reattaching mirrors is ongoing with le cyclop located in millylaforêt near paris the tarot garden was under development for almost  years and  million roughly  million in  dollars was spent to construct it the foundation of the tarot garden was constituted in  and would attain official juridical status in  and the garden officially

elements saint phalle continued to paint particularly after she and her family moved to paris in the mids her first art exhibition was held in  in switzerland where she displayed her naïve style of

altar  resembles smaller versions of the tirs series but was not shot or paintsplattered saint phalle created a series of works in the early s she called tirs shootings or shots the series began as target pictures with painted bullseye targets prominently displayed within her painted collages such as saint sébastien portrait of my loverportrait of my belovedmartyr nécessaire  or assemblage figure with dartboard head  she would invite viewers to throw darts at the dartboards embedded as faces in her figurative assemblages which were influenced by the targets painted by her friend jasper johns soon she would start by embedding knives razor blades scissors eggbeaters babydoll arms and other household items in plaster covering a large board along with bags filled with colorful paints cans of spray paint and sometimes a tomato in addition she might suspend bags of paint or cans of spray paint in front of the whitepainted assemblage she would then repeatedly shoot the assemblage with a pistol rifle or miniature cannon causing the liquids to bleed or to spray out her first staged public shooting event was in february  attended by jean tinguely daniel spoerri and pierre restany among others as founder of the nouveau réalisme new realist movement restany asked saint phalle to join this group of french artists upon seeing her performance she was the only female member of this group these extreme expressions of violence attracted media attention catapulting saint phalle into the ranks of avantgarde artistic rebellion the tirs combined performance body art sculpture and painting in the artistic ferment of the s saint phalle began to stage variations on this process in art museums and galleries and recruited other artists to join in staged public happenings where some of her colleagues would also pull the trigger she met many other emerging artists through these performances including robert rauschenberg ad reinhardt frank stella and edward kienholz she would also invite gallery visitors to shoot at her assemblages she participated in spoerris edition mat multiplication d’art transformable program of multiple artwork editions supplying simpler versions of her tir works with detailed instructions on how to shoot them with a  rifle saint phalle carefully documented her artistic process in the tirs with writing still photos and films she would attach readymade common artifacts to a board attach bags of colorful paint whitewash everything and then dip the assemblage into milkwhite plaster once it had dried the assemblage was ready for shooting by a purchaser in june  niki de saint phalle and jean tinguely joined jasper johns and robert rauschenberg in a concerthappening called variations ii orchestrated by avantgarde american composer john cage and held at the american embassy in paris while david tudor played cage compositions on the piano the artists created their works of art on stage as the audience watched the proceedings in august

series to galleries in new york city and los angeles inviting the public to participate in the shootings in los angeles she shot a largescale king kong assemblage she had constructed paintspattering the embedded sculpted faces of politicians such as john f kennedy fidel castro and charles de gaulle with santa claus and donald duck as well this work would later be acquired by the moderna museet in

studios which they would share over the decades to come nanas edit gwendolyn  le poète et sa muse poet and his muse  blue nana  a nana a black nana saint phalle next explored the various roles of women in what would develop into her bestknown and most prolific series of sculptures she started making lifesize dolls of women such as brides and mothers giving birth monsters and large heads initially they were made of soft materials such as wool cloth and papiermâché but they soon evolved into plaster over a wire framework and plastic toys some painted all white as the series developed into larger monumental works saint phalle used composite fiberglassreinforced polyester plastic also known as frp or grp decorated with multiple brightcolored acrylic or polyester paints she also used polyurethane foam in many of her sculptures these innovative materials enabled the construction of colorful largescale sculptures with a new ease and fluidity of form however the fabrication and painting processes can release large numbers of glass fibers and chemicals such as styrene epoxy and solvent fumes which may cause health problems if not used carefully in  she created a series of sculptures protesting stereotypical societal roles for women as child bearers devouring mothers witches and prostitutes some of her early artworks from this bride period depicted ghostly skeletal brides dressed in white which have been compared to miss havisham an ethereal character in charles dickens novel great expectations over time these figures became more joyful whimsical colorful and larger in scale inspired by a collaborative drawing with american artist larry rivers of his wife her pregnant friend clarice price saint phalle began to portray archetypal female figures with a more optimistic view of the position of women in society the newer figures took on ecstatic dance poses and even acrobatic positions such as handstands and cartwheels saint phalles lighthearted figures have been compared to the joyful dancers of matisse and the sturdy female figures by gaston lachaise aristide maillol and rodin by  she was calling her artistic expressions of the proverbial everywoman nanas after a french slang word that is roughly equivalent to broad or chick the first of these freelyposed forms—made of papiermâché yarn and cloth—were exhibited at the alexander iolas gallery in paris in september  for this show iolas published saint phalles first artist book that included her handwritten text in combination with her drawings of bananas during this show she joined a type of tombola raffle organized by the artists club of new york whereby artworks were randomly left in coinoperated luggage lockers at pennsylvania station and keys were offered for  each

the moderna museet in stockholm sweden during construction saint phalle recruited swiss art student rico weber de who had been working as a dishwasher in the museum restaurant in the following years he would become an important assistant and collaborator for both saint phalle and tinguely a team of  people worked strenuously for  days first building a frame using metal rebar covering it with chicken wire sheathing it with fabric attached with a smelly animal glue and then painting the inside of the enclosure black and covering the outside in bright colors the final structure was  feet  m long and  feet  m wide weighing around  tonnes  kg the outer form was a giant reclining sculpture of a pregnant woman a nana whose internal body cavity could be entered through a doorsized vaginal opening between her legs written on one of hons massive thighs was the motto honi soit qui mal y pense shamed be he who evil of it thinks inside the massive sculpture were a seat cinema theater a milk bar inside a breast a fish pond and a brain built by tinguely with moving mechanical parts in addition the sprawling nana contained a coin telephone a loveseat sofa a museum of fake paintings a sandwich vending machine an art installation by ultvedt and a playground slide for children after an initial shocked silence the installation elicited immense public commentary in magazines and newspapers throughout the world raising awareness of the moderna museet over  visitors crowded in to experience the immersive environment including many children at the end of  months the entire temporary setup was demolished and removed except for the head which was preserved by the museum in its permanent collection some small fragments were attached to limitededition exhibition catalogs and sold as mementos around this time saint phalle also designed stage sets and costumes for theatrical productions éloge de la folie praise of the madness  a ballet by roland petit an adaptation of the aristophanes play lysistrata  and a germanlanguage play she cowrote with rainer von diez titled ich all about me  large fixed or moveable nana figures were prominent in several of these productions in  saint phalle began working with polyester resin a material which could be shaped easily but would transform into a hard smooth weatherresistant surface this new technology enabled her to construct enormous fantastical figures for display outdoors in public spaces and parks the material is reasonably durable outdoors similar materials are used for boats and car bodies though decades of weather exposure would eventually cause deterioration requiring art conservation measures in  she exhibited le paradis fantastique the fantastic paradise a collaborative grouping of  of her sculptures with  machines built by tinguely on the rooftop terrace of the level french pavilion at expo  in montreal the composition was originally conceived of as an attack by tinguelys dark mechanical constructions upon saint phalles brightlycolored animals and female figures a kind of amorous warfare although the french pavilion itself was popular most visitors did not see the rooftop terrace where the sculptures were installed in  the sculptures were redisplayed at the albrightknox gallery in buffalo new york and in new york central park in  some of the artworks were purchased by the moderna museet in stockholm sweden and permanently installed in an outdoors sculpture garden in  she first disclosed that she had developed respiratory problems from exposure to dust and fumes in making her artwork starting in  saint phalle sold nana inflatable pool toys amid criticism from the art world she ignored the complaints focusing on raising money for her future monumental projects in the coming years she would face more criticism for overcommercializing and popularizing her artwork but she raised significant funding that enabled her to finance several ambitious projects on her own over the years she produced clothing jewelry perfume glass or porcelain figures furniture and craft items many with a nana theme from  she worked on her first fullscale architecture project three small sculptural houses for rainer von diez in southern france which she called le rêve de loiseau fr the dream of the bird the project was a collaboration with him and jean tinguely and a forerunner

forêt meaning the monster in the forest in millylaforêt near paris collaborators included daniel spoerri bernhard luginbuhl and eva aeppli eventually  different people worked on the project which would not be considered finished until  in november  as part of an artists reunion celebrating the th anniversary of the founding of the nouveaux réalistes saint phalle shot at an altar assemblage on  july  saint phalle and tinguely legally became married though the immediate reason may have been tax savings as saint phalle thus became a swiss citizen their marriage did give the two artists mutual control over each others artistic estate if one of them should die that same year she designed her first pieces of jewelry in  she installed golem commissioned by the then mayor teddy kollek at a childrens playground in the kiryat hayovel neighborhood of jerusalem it is a giant monster with three red tongues protruding from its mouth which serve as playground slides starting in  she engaged

the garden i imposed my vision because i could not do otherwise the garden was made with difficulties wild enthusiasm obsession and most of all faith nothing could have stopped me as in all fairy tales before finding the treasure i met on my path dragons sorcerors magicians and the angel of temperance —niki de saint phalle ” in  saint phalle had visited antoni gaudís parc güell in barcelona spain which inspired her to use diverse materials and found objects as essential elements in her art another influence was the parco dei mostri in bomarzo in the tuscany region of italy in the late s she and jean tinguely had visited le palais idéal built by ferdinand cheval in hauterives france as well as simon rodia’s watts towers in los angeles in the early s both locations were examples of fantastical outsider art and architecture built by ordinary working men of modest means but expansive vision saint phalle decided that she wanted to make something similar a monumental sculpture

resembled her colorful sketches and drawings but scaled up to monumental size she also continued to produce her nanas in addition to her new style of sculpture both styles of figures would appear in her tarot garden project in  saint phalle and her team began to build the first architectural sculpture in the garden as the project progressed saint phalle started taking lessons in the italian

work on the project for  years and recruit his nephews to join in some family members are still involved in maintaining the site she invited artist friends from argentina scotland holland and france to help work on the sculptures over time saint phalle worked with dozens of people including architects ceramicists iron workers brick layers painters and mosaic artists the materials used in the tarot garden project would include steel iron cement polyester ceramic mosaic glass mirrors and polished stones which she called mms the structure of the larger sculptures was very similar to the temporary hon installation at the moderna museet in  but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the longterm weathering effects of sun and rain the basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar a second layer of lightergauge steel reinforcement bars was added followed by two layers of expanded metal a specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure a layer of tar for waterproofing and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy hollow structure ready for decoration in  she also began selling a series of polyester snake chairs vases and lamps that year she recorded her first attack of rheumatoid arthritis a painful disease affecting the joints of the skeleton in  she designed a colorful paint scheme for a piper aerostar  p twinengine airplane which participated in the first transatlantic race sponsored by the peter stuyvesant foundation of amsterdam as an act of playful rebellion against

young people from garavicchio to help with construction of the garden jean tinguely led a swiss team comprising seppi imhoff and rico weber and started welding the frames of the sculptures the following year dutch artist doc winsen also called dok van winsen took up the welding operations in  she developed and marketed an eponymous perfume using the proceeds to help finance her project the perfume bottle top featured a small sculpture of two intertwined snakes one golden and the other brightly multicolored she may have raised as much as a third of the funds she needed for the garden in this way she actively solicited funding from friends and acquaintances as well as by selling her artworks in  saint phalle collaborated with tinguely to produce the stravinsky fountain a piece

inside one breast and her kitchen was inside the other one each of these two rooms had a single recessed circular window appearing as an inverted nipple when viewed from the outside in  she would recall at last my lifelong wish to live inside a sculpture was going to be granted a space entirely made out of undulating curves  i wanted to invent a new mother a mother goddess and be reborn within its form  i would sleep in one breast in the other i would put my kitchen the ground floor contained a large mirrored space with a mirrored dining table where she would serve lunch to workmen and artists beneath a chandelier tinguely had made with a cow skull she used this motherly role to help reinforce her authority in directing the team of men she needed to help build her project eventually she would grow tired of the cramped space in the womb of her mother and after  would move into a newyorkloftstyle studio which she had built for herself underground at the site around  saint phalle
