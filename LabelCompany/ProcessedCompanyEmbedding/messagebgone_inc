actual results   being an emerging growth company   messagebgone inc is a shell company as defined in rule  because it is a company with nominal operations and it has assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents we have no plans or intention to be acquired or to merge with an operating company additionally there are no plans to enter into a change of control or similar transaction or to change the management of the company   the company is an emerging growth company and the company intends to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section b of the jumpstart our business startups act of    an issuer remains an emerging growth company until the earliest of   the last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of  billion or more   the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering date   the date on which during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt or   the date on which during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt or   the date on which during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt or   the date on which it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in section b– of title  code of federal regulations or any successor for that matter          emerging growth company exemptions   an emerging growth company could be capable of taking advantage of several exemptions such as sayonpay  section ae of the securities exchange act of  has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the sayonpay sayonpay frequency and sayongolden parachute requirements that were enacted as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act after cessation of emerging growth company status if an issuer was an emerging growth company for less than two years after its initial public offering date it must hold a sayonpay vote no later than the end of the threeyear period beginning on the date it is no longer an emerging growth company any other company that has ceased to be an emerging growth company must hold a sayonpay vote no later than the end of the oneyear period beginning on the date it is no longer an emerging growth company in addition following cessation of emerging growth company status a company will become subject to the sayonpayfrequency and sayongolden parachute provisions of rule a promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended   the us securities and exchange commission has not yet finalized the regulations implementing the payversusperformance requirements of the doddfrank act   payversusperformance

ratio disclosure  section b of the doddfrank act has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirement to compare ceo compensation to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the issuer other than the ceo the securities and exchange commission has not yet finalized the regulations implementing the pay ratio disclosure requirements of the doddfrank act   compensation disclosures  emerging growth companies may comply with the less burdensome executive compensation disclosure requirements applicable to any issuer with a market value of less than  million of outstanding voting and nonvoting common equity held by nonaffiliates currently these provisions are set forth in item l through r of regulation sk as applicable to smaller reporting companies   financial statement requirements  section  of the securities act of  as amended has been revised to require that two years rather than three years of audited financial statements be included in any registration statement filed with the us securities and exchange commission by an emerging growth company similarly an emerging growth company need only present its managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for each period for which financial statements are presented rather than the periods required by item  of regulation sk furthermore an emerging growth company need not present selected financial data for any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in connection with its initial public offering in addition an emerging growth company need not comply with any new or revised financial accounting standard until such date that a company that is not an issuer as defined in section  of the sarbanes oxley act of  generally a nonpublic company is required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards similar changes were also made to section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended   internal control over financial reporting  section b of sarbanesoxley has been amended to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirement to obtain an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting from the issuers registered public accounting firm currently this requirement is only applicable to accelerated filers and large accelerated filers  as defined in rule b promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended   the exemptions listed above could be available to the company and the company intends to take advantage of the extended transition period

investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this prospectus before investing in our common stock you are urged to carefully review and consider the section entitled risk factors beginning on page  of this prospectus if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed currently shares of our common stock are not publicly traded in the event that shares of our common stock become publicly traded the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks resulting in the loss of all or part of your investment in the event our common stock fails to become publicly traded you may also lose all or part of your investment   risks related to the offering   as there is no minimum for our offering if only a few persons purchase shares they will lose their investment without the company being able to make a significant attempt to implement its business plan   since there is no minimum amount of shares that must be sold directly by the company under this offering if a limited number of shares are sold we may not have enough capital to fully implement our proposed plan of operations as such we may not be able to meet the objectives we state in this prospectus or eliminate the going concern modification in the reports of our auditors as to uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern if we fail to raise sufficient capital we would expect to have insufficient funds for our ongoing operating expenses any significant lack of funds will curtail the development and growth of our business and may cause our business to fail if our business fails investors will lose their entire investment   weare a developmentstage company and we have no operating history therefore we may never be able to carry out our proposed plan of operations or achieve any significant revenue or profitability    we are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise and we have not generated any revenues to date any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon the successful development and implementation of our proposed communications product and its successful marketing and sale which are subject to numerous risk factors as set forth herein accordingly we may not be able to successfully carry out our plan of operations and investors may lose their entire investment   we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares   this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through arraya wilaiphan our sole officer and director who will receive no commissions or other remuneration from any sales made mr wilaiphan will offer the shares to friends family members and business associates however there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless mr wilaiphan is successful in selling all of the shares and we receive the maximum amount of proceeds from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our plan of operations          we may not be able to further implement our business strategy unless sufficient funds are raised in this offering   we may not realize sufficient proceeds from this offering to further business development or to provide adequate cash flow for our planned business activities as of august   we had  cash on hand and have sustained a net loss of  we have not generated any revenue from our operations to date at this rate we expect that we will not be able to continue operations without obtaining additional funding or beginning to generate revenue accordingly we anticipate that additional funding will be needed for general administrative expenses the design and development of our proposed communications offering business development and marketing costs   our sole officer and director arraya wilaiphan has agreed to lend the company up to  in funds so it can remain a current issuer there is no written agreement with mr wilaiphan given past expenditures the company anticipates that it will require approximately  per quarter to remain a current issuer  the company will be able to conduct its business with current funding for an additional three quarters at this rate of expenditure   we do not currently have any arrangements for financing and our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors including general market conditions investor acceptance of our plan of operations and initial results from our business operations there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us failure to secure additional financing will cause us to go out of business if this happens you could lose all or part of your investment   if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility the sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all   because our sole officer and director currently owns all of our outstanding common stock investors may find that decisions influenced by him are inconsistent with the best interests of other stockholders   arraya wilaiphan our sole officer and director currently owns all of the outstanding shares of our common stock and upon completion of this offering will likely own a large percentage of our outstanding common stock accordingly he may have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control of our company factors that could cause his interests to differ from the interests of other stockholders include the impact of corporate transactions on the timing of business operations and his ability to continue to manage the business given the amount of time he is able to devote to our company while we have no current plans with regard to any merger consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets the interests of our sole officer and director may still differ from the interests of other stockholders   there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   as of august   the company has not generated revenue has no certainty of earning revenue in the future and has a working capital deficit and a net loss of  since inception these factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to generate future revenue will depend on a number of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include general economic conditions market acceptance of our proposed product and competitive efforts due to these factors we cannot anticipate with any degree of certainty what our revenue will be in future periods as such our independent certified public accountants have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise you should carefully consider our independent certified public accountants comments when determining if an investment in the company is suitable          we are an emerginggrowth company under the jobs act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors   we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  or the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act of  as amended for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates   we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed  billion if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a threeyear period or if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million   because our company is a shell company there are restrictions imposed upon the transferability of unregistered shares and you will not be able to resell your shares in certain circumstances    we are a shell company within the meaning of rule  promulgated pursuant to securities act of  as amended because we have nominal assets and nominal operations accordingly the securities sold in this offering can only be resold through registration under section  the securities act of  as amended section  if available for nonaffiliates or by meeting the conditions of rule i which will potentially reduce liquidity of our securities another implication of us being a shell company are enhanced reporting requirements imposed on shell companies and that we cannot file registration statements under section  of the securities act of  as amended using a form s a short form of registration to register securities issued to employees and consultants under an employee benefit plan additionally though exemptions such as under section  of the securities act of  as amended may be available for nonaffiliate holders of our shares to resell their shares because we are a shell company a holder of our securities may not rely on the safe harbor from being deemed statutory underwriter under section  of the securities act of  as amended as provided by rule  to resell his or her securities only after we i are not a shell company and ii have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by section  or d of the securities exchange act of  as amended as applicable during the preceding  months or for such shorter period that we may be required to file such reports and materials other than form k reports and have filed current form  information with the us securities and exchange commission reflecting our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of not less than  months can our securities be resold pursuant to rule  form  information is generally speaking the same type of information as we are required to disclose in this prospectus but without an offering of securities these circumstances regarding how rule  applies to shell companies may hinder your resale of your shares of the company being a shell company will also negatively impact on our ability to attract additional capital through subsequent unregistered offerings    we may be unable to comply with disclosure controls and procedures necessary to make required public filings   we currently have no fulltime employees although we intend to add personnel following this offering given our limited resources we may be unable to maintain effective controls to insure that we are able to make all required public filings in a timely manner if we are successful in having our common stock listed on a stock exchange or quotation service and if we do not make all public filings in a timely manner our shares of common stock may be delisted and we could also be subject to regulatory action andor lawsuits by stockholders   as a section d filer we will not be a fully reporting company   we will not be subject to the proxy rules under section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended the prohibition of shortswing profits under section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended the thirdparty tender offer rules or the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of sections d and g of the securities exchange act of  as amended if we have less than three hundred shareholders following the fiscal year in which our registration statement becomes effective our periodic reporting obligations under section a will be automatically suspended under section d of the securities exchange act of  as amended   risks related to our business   key management personnel may leave the company which could adversely affect the ability of the company to continue operations   we are entirely dependent on the efforts of araya wilaiphan our sole officer and director because of the time and effort that he devotes to messagebgone inc mr wilaiphan is in charge of overseeing all business development strategies supervising anyall future personnel including any consultants or contractors that we will engage to assist in developing our proposed communications product and the establishment of our future sales and marketing efforts the loss of mr wilaiphan or other key personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we do not maintain key person life insurance on our officers directors or key employees our success will depend on the performance of mr wilaiphan and our ability to attract and motivate other key personnel          shareholders may have difficulties enforcing their legal rights under united states securities laws because our sole officer and director resides outside of the united states   while we are a nevada corporation our sole officer and director resides in the province of chachoengsao in thailand his ability to travel to the united states is dependent on a number of factors some of which may be outside of his control these include availability financial geographical and personal matters and passport and visa regulations although in person jurisdiction may be difficult to obtain our sole officer and director remains subject to his obligations as an officer and director of a nevada corporation and the federal securities laws applicable to officers and directors of united states corporations however no assurances can be made that our sole officer and director will be able to attend any event in the united states in a timely manner or at all therefore an investor may not be able to effect service of process on our sole officer and director in the united states or enforce a judgment against our sole officer and director additionally courts in the kingdom of thailand may not recognize or enforce united states judgments   presently the companys sole officer and director has other outside business interests and as such he is not devoting all of his time to the company   our sole officer and director arraya wilaiphan has other outside business activities but he is committed to devote approximately  hours per week to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times when mr wilaiphan is unavailable which may lead to periodic interruption in the implementation of our business plan such delays could have a significant negative effect on the success of our business   our sole officer and director has no direct experience in communications or software development   arraya wilaiphan our sole officer and director has no direct experience in communications or software development as a result he may not be fully aware of many of the specific requirements relating to these areas of business mr wilaiphans decisions and choices may not take into account the business marketing or sales strategies that are commonly deployed in the industry consequently our operations earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to his lack of experience in these areas as a result we may have to suspend or cease operations which will result in the loss of your investment   compensation may be paid to our officers directors and employees regardless of our profitability such payments may negatively affect our cash flow and our ability to finance our business plan which would cause our business to fail   arraya wilaiphan our sole officer and director is not presently receiving compensation however he and any future employees of our company may be entitled to receive compensation payments and reimbursements regardless of whether we operate at a profit or a loss any compensation received by mr wilaiphan or the board of directors which currently consists only of mr wilaiphan or any other personal that mr wilaiphan in his capacity as sole officer and director as applicable will determine from time to time we expect to reimburse our sole officer and director and any future personnel for any direct outofpocket expenses they incur on behalf of us   we may be unable to acquire or retain subscribers   we must acquire customers to subscribe to our proposed communications product in order to generate revenue and achieve profitability if customers do not perceive our proposed communications product to be of high value and quality or if we fail to introduce a product that is customized to the needs and interests of our customers we may not be able to acquire or retain customers   we believe that many of our subscribers will originate from wordofmouth and nonpaid referrals from other subscribers and therefore we must ensure that those subscribers remain satisfied and loyal to our company in order to continue receiving those referrals once we establish a subscriber base if our efforts to satisfy our established subscribers are not successful we may not be able to acquire new subscribers in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business or we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenses in order to acquire new customers a decline in the number of subscribers or in subscriber satisfaction would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations          we currently have no subscribers to our proposed communications product we have not identified any subscribers and we cannot guarantee we ever will have any subscribers even if we obtain subscribers there is no guarantee that we will generate a profit if we cannot generate a profit we will have to suspend or cease operations you are likely to lose your entire investment if we cannot sell our proposed communications product at a price and in a quantity that generates a profit   there are no substantial barriers to entry into the marketplace for the product we intend to develop and sell   since our proposed communications product has yet to be developed other persons may develop the same or a substantially similar product and bring it to market before we do alternatively other persons may attempt to copy aspects of our business including our website design product or marketing materials any encroachment upon our corporate information including the unauthorized use of our brand name the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated against us for infringement upon another companys proprietary information or improper use of their trademark may affect our ability to create brand name recognition cause customer confusion andor have a detrimental effect on our business litigation or proceedings before united states or international trademark offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and domain name andor to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others any such infringement litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations andor the results of operations   we plan to conduct international business transactions and will be exposed to local business risks in different countries which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations   we intend to market and sell our proposed communications product internationally and we expect to have customers located in many countries our international operations will be subject to the risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including but not necessarily limited to     · new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions         · potentially adverse tax consequences including the imposition or increase of taxes on transactions or withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments         · risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments         · legal restrictions on doing business in or with certain nations certain parties andor certain products and         · local economic political and social conditions including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability   we may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing factors in a timely and effective manner in the locations where we intend to do business consequently the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our operations and upon our financial condition and results of operations   since our proposed communications product will be available for subscription over the internet in foreign countries and we will have customers residing in foreign countries foreign jurisdictions may require us to qualify to do business in their countries we may be required to comply with certain laws and regulations of each country in which we conduct business including laws and regulations currently in place or which may be enacted related to internet sales and communications services available to the residents of each country from online sites located elsewhere          failure to comply with existing us and nonus privacy laws and regulations or the enactment of new privacy laws or regulations could adversely affect our business   a variety of us and nonus laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of consumer data existing privacyrelated laws and regulations are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations in addition us and nonus legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or enact new laws regarding privacy matters we intend to post privacy policies and practices concerning the collection use and disclosure of subscriber data on our website several us states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any datarelated consent orders us federal trade commission requirements or orders or other us or nonus privacy or consumer protectionrelated laws regulations or industry selfregulatory principles could result in claims proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities which could adversely affect our business in addition a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business   the failure of thirdparty systems or thirdparty service and software providers upon which we will rely could adversely affect our business   we will rely on certain thirdparty computer systems or thirdparty service and software providers including data centers technology platforms backoffice systems internet service providers and communication facilities any interruption in these thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance or quality could adversely affect our business if our arrangement with any thirdparty is terminated we may not be able to find alternative systems or service providers on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we plan to host our website and serve all of our potential subscribers from thirdparty internet servers which will be located at various data center facilities problems faced by these data center locations or with the telecommunications network providers with whom they may contract could adversely affect the experience of our subscribers if these data centers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity or close without adequate notice this could have an adverse effect on our business any changes in thirdparty service levels at these data centers or any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with these services could harm our reputation and adversely affect the performance of our proposed communications product interruptions in these services might reduce our sales revenues subject us to potential liability and thereby adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we cannot guarantee that our website will operate or our proposed communications product will function without interruption or error we are bound only by a best efforts obligation as regards the operation and continuity of service although we are not liable for the fraudulent access to data andor accidental transmission through viruses or other harmful conduct in connection with the use of our website or proposed product disruption of our communications service would adversely affect our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows   there is a risk that we may be unable to continue to provide our proposed communications product or continue operations if we experience uninsured losses or an act of god   we may but are not required to obtain comprehensive liability and other business insurance of the types customarily maintained by businesses similar to our own there are certain types of extraordinary occurrences however which may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable for example in the event of a major earthquake our computer systems could be rendered inoperable for protracted periods of time which would impair our ability to maintain our website market and sell our proposed communications product and collect revenues thus adversely affecting our financial condition in the event of a major civil disturbance our operations could also be adversely affected if such an uninsured loss should occur we could lose significant revenues and financial opportunities in amounts that would not be partially or fully compensated by insurance proceeds          we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively mange the growth of our company   we anticipate experiencing rapid growth in demand for our proposed communications product we expect the number of our consultants service providers employees and customers to increase over time once we launch our sales and marketing campaign and we expect our growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and product offerings could place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources we will need to manage multiple relationships with various consultants customers website developers and other third parties to effectively manage the growth of our company we will need to continually implement operational plans and strategies improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems and train and manage our future employee and thirdparty service provider base our inability to effectively manage the growth of our company would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   we will be subject to paymentsrelated risks   we plan to accept payment for subscriptions to our proposed communications product using a variety of methods including credit cards and debit cards as we offer new payment options to consumers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud not being a financial institution we cannot belong to or directly access credit card associations such as american express visa mastercard etc as a result we will have to rely on banks or payment processors to process transactions for us if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us our business and subscriber services will likely suffer substantial disruption for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we will be required to pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time raise our operating costs and lower our profitability we will also be subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected   risks related to our common stock   investing in the common stock of our company is a highly speculative investment and could result in the loss of your entire investment   a purchase of the shares offered in this prospectus is highly speculative and involves significant risks any person who cannot afford the loss of his or her entire investment should not purchase the offered shares our business objectives are also speculative and we may be unable to satisfy those objectives the shareholders of our company may be unable to realize a substantial return on their purchase of the offered shares or any return whatsoever and may lose their entire investment in our company for this reason each prospective purchaser of the offered shares should read this prospectus and all of its exhibits carefully and consult with their attorney business advisor andor investment advisor   in the event that our shares are publicly traded our stock price may be volatile   in the event that our shares are publicly traded the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various potential factors many of which will be beyond the companys control including the following      · changes in the reliability or availability of our proposed product by us or our potential competitors         · additions or departures of key personnel         · the companys ability to execute its business plan         · operating results that fall below expectations         · industry developments   in addition the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock           as a public company we will incur substantial expenses   upon declared effectiveness of this registration statement by the securities and exchange commission we will become subject to the information and reporting requirements of the us securities laws the us securities laws require among other things review audit and public reporting of our financial results business activities and other matters recent securities and exchange commission regulation including regulation enacted as a result of the sarbanesoxley act of  has also substantially increased the accounting legal and other costs related to becoming and remaining a securities and exchange commission reporting company if we do not have current information about our company available to market makers they will not be able to trade our stock the public company costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the securities and exchange commission and furnishing audited reports to stockholders will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we were privatelyheld these increased costs may be material and may include the hiring of additional employees andor the retention of additional advisors and professionals as a result we may not have sufficient funds to grow our operations additionally our failure to comply with the us securities laws could result in private or governmental legal action against the company andor our officers and directors which could have a detrimental effect on our business and finances the value of our common stock and the ability of stockholders to resell their stock   we have not yet adopted certain corporate governance measures   the sarbanesoxley act of  as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the securities and exchange commission the new york and american stock exchanges and the nasdaq stock market as a result of the sarbanesoxley act requires the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance these measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges or the nasdaq stock market because we are not presently required to comply with many of these corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than necessary we have not yet adopted these measures   because our sole director is nonindependent we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees as a result our sole director has the ability among other things to determine his own level of compensation until we comply with such corporate governance measures regardless of whether such compliance is required the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions conflicts of interest and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations   in the event that our shares are publicly traded they may trade under  per share and thus will be a penny stock   in the event that our shares are publicly traded and our stock trades below  per share our stock would be known as a penny stock which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given prior to the purchase of any penny stock the us securities and exchange commission has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions depending on market fluctuations our common stock could be considered to be a penny stock a penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors for transactions covered by these rules the brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities in addition he must receive the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase he must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser consequently the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them these disclosures require acknowledgement that the investor understands the risks associated with buying penny stocks and can absorb the loss of the entire investment penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume consequently the price of the stock is often volatile and an investor may not be able to buy or sell the stock when desired          in the event that our shares are publicly traded finra rules may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock   the financial industry regulatory authority finra has adopted rules that relate to the application of the securities and exchange commissions penny stock rules and require that a brokerdealer have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending the investment prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers in the event that our shares are publicly traded and are considered to be a penny stock these finra requirements will make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock further many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions as a result fewer brokerdealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock reducing a shareholders ability to resell shares of our common stock   if we are dissolved it is unlikely that there will be sufficient assets remaining to distribute to shareholders   in the event of our dissolution any proceeds realized from the liquidation of our assets will be distributed to shareholders only after all the claims of our creditors are satisfied in that case the ability of purchasers of the offered shares to recover any portion of the purchase price for the offered shares will depend on the amount of funds realized and the claims to be satisfied   investors will pay more for our common stock than the pro rata portion of our assets are worth as a result investing in our common stock may result in an immediate loss   the offering price and other terms and conditions regarding our shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective criteria of value additionally since we have recently formed and have only a limited operating history and no earnings the price of the offered shares is not based on our past earnings no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares   the arbitrary offering price of  per common share is substantially higher than the net tangible book value of  per share of our common stock our assets do not substantiate a share price of  per share this premium in share price applies to the terms of this offering and does not attempt to reflect any forwardlooking share price subsequent to our obtaining a listing on any exchange or becoming quoted on either the overthecounter bulletin board or the otc markets if ever          our management could issue additional shares or create and issue additional classes of shares thereby diluting our current shareholders equity   we have  authorized shares of common stock with a par value of  per share of which  shares of common stock are currently issued and outstanding if this offering is fully subscribed  shares of common stock will be issued and outstanding after the offering terminates we only have a single class of shares ie common stock and do not anticipate creating any additional classes of shares in the foreseeable future our management could without the consent of our then existing shareholders issue substantially more shares or create and issue additional classes of shares potentially causing a large dilution in the equity position of our then existing shareholders additionally large share issuances by us would generally have a negative impact on our share price it is possible that due to additional share issuance or the creation and issuance of additional classes of shares you could lose a substantial amount or all of your investment   we do not have an escrow or trust account for investor subscriptions   invested funds for this offering will not be placed in an escrow or trust account accordingly if we file for bankruptcy protection or creditors file a petition for involuntary bankruptcy against us investor funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws as such investors will lose their investment and their funds will be used to pay creditors and will not be used for developing our business   we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future   we do not anticipate paying dividends on either our common stock or on any class of preferred stock that may be created and issued in the foreseeable future rather we plan to retain earnings if any for the operation growth and expansion of our business          use of proceeds   our offering is being made on a selfunderwritten basis therefore no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed the offering price per share is  for the duration of the

operations on page    there is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire amount of this offering the chart on page  details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only  or  or  of this offering   if less than  of this offering is sold we will have to reduce both our development and marketing plans in order to try to guarantee the success of the development of our business in this situation we will prioritize spending based on the viability of the company therefore we will allocate the majority of the funds raised to first hire thirdparty software developers to develop our communications product and second to hire thirdparty web developers to develop our website thereafter if sufficient funds are available we will invest in hiring third parties to perform quality assurance testing support services and internet marketing   determination of offering price   the price of the current offering is fixed at  per share for the duration of the offering as there is no established public market for our shares the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to our shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective criteria of value in addition no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares            dilution   the price of the current offering is fixed at  per share for the duration of the offering this price is significantly greater than the price paid by our sole officer and director for common equity since the companys inception on august   our sole officer and director paid  per share a difference of  per share lower than the share price in this offering anyone investing in our common stock through this offering will immediately have significant dilution of his or her common stock    dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing shareholders the following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing shareholders   existing shareholder if  of the shares are sold   price per share       net tangible book value per share before offering       potential gain to existing

developmentstage company that intends to develop market and sell a subscription communications service providing secure pointtopoint email messages and attachments to date our operations have been limited to researching the marketplace for our proposed communications product and the issues entailed in developing this product as well as the preliminary design and development of our website we have not yet implemented our business model or undertaken development of our proposed communications product to date we have generated no revenues from our operations there can be no assurances that our efforts to develop our proposed communications service will succeed or that we will be able to market our proposed communications service if developed    our business   we intend to develop launch market and sell via subscription what will be depending on user preferences the most secure closed pointtopoint email system available today at the present time privacy breeches in communications between friends family members corporate employees and even lovers are daily events malicious attacks on personal and corporate data are difficult to control particularly given todays open communications services and cloud storage offerings our proposed closed messaging system will be designed to alleviate the majority of security concerns inherent in the most popular open style text and email communications systems available today          our proposed messagebgone application mba is not an email system per se nor is it a replacement for conventional email and will not accept messages sent through other email or communications providers the mba will also not permit messages to be sent via interface with other email or communications providers only email messages created within the mba application and sent between mba users will be allowed this will create a completely closed and secure pointtopoint communications system between mba subscribers allowing them to send unlimited messages in the format of email together with portable document format pdf attachments if desired once subscribed an mba user will be able to download either a windows or macbased software application that will facilitate the exchange of secure encrypted messages and attachments between mba subscribers within the closed system   market opportunity   some of the weakest links in computer security result from the combination of computers utilizing operating systems such as windows and osi together with web browsers such as safari ™ and explorer ™ with a multitude of known and everemerging security issues any messaging system running within a web browser can only be as secure as the browser itself and can readily lend itself to security breeches due to browser security shortcomings rather than security issues with the computer program itself therefore instead of being a web browserbased computer application the mba will function as a lowlevel application that will not interact with either computer operating systems or web browsers   by writing lowlevel code that will operate independently below a computers operating system and outside of any web browser there is little chance that a breech of the operating system or browser security will have any impact on the security of the mba for added security we intend to block the functionality of some operating system hot keys such as print screen and screen capture to assist in the containment of the received message we will also recommend other security precautions to our users in an effort to help them identify and remove malware keylogging technologies and other types of spyware that could affect a mba users message security   every message and attachment sent via the mba will be encrypted on the users desktop utilizing aes  bit encryption and will then be uploaded to be stored on the messagebgone server where it will remain encrypted until downloaded and unencrypted by the recipient mba user additional security features will include no message logging no password logging and no internet protocol logging or retention additionally when a message is deleted from the messagebgone server it is truly gone forever no copies of the message will ever be stored on either the senders or the recipients computer   the mba will allow a user to compose and send messages in the format of email attaching a pdf if desired and view messages and pdf attachments only in the mba there will be no way to save a message or an attachment  only the ability to view it once the messages intended recipient downloads unencrypts and views the message andor attachment it will be automatically deleted from the messagebgone server forever when the recipient closes their mba if a message is sent to a user and is undelivered for a period of five days individual users may choose a shorter auto delete period it will be also be permanently deleted from the server the messagebgone server and the mba will have no directory of users therefore a message author will need to know the mba address of the recipient and type it into the application on the creation of every message once a message is opened in the mba it will remain on the users screen for five minutes and will then permanently autodelete additionally the application will close in  seconds if there is no user interaction   the company will setup severs in various countries depending on the most favorable hosting and security issues for example germany does not require severs to store a traffic logs of ip addresses and visitors the website that will be designed to allow customers to subscribe to and download the mba service and will accept both traditional credit cards paypal and alternative bitcoins hyper wallets payment methods that will give customers additional levels of security with the option of total anonymity if a mba customer should choose to use an anonymous payment system such as bitcoins this mba user would be anonymous even to us should an mba user also choose to utilize their own onetime aes  bit encryption key for every message they would enjoy the greatest level of security and anonymity available in the industry as it could take hundreds or even thousands of years to decrypt a single message if it where ever to be intercepted          employees and employment agreements   we have no employees other than our sole officer and director arraya wilaiphan mr wilaiphan is also employed elsewhere has the flexibility to work on our company approximately fifteen hours per week and may be prepared to devote additional time to our operations if required   we presently do not have pension health annuity insurance stock options profit sharing or similar benefit plans however we may adopt such plans in the future there are presently no personal benefits available to our director for time spent as a director   managements discussion and analysis or plan of operation   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this registration statement and prospectus the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this registration statement and prospectus particularly in the section entitled risk factors which begins on page    our audited financial statements are stated in us dollars and are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap   company overview   we are a developmentstage company that intends to provide a subscriptionbased highly secure closed pointtopoint communications service for messages and attachments we have recently commenced business operations and have not generated any revenues to date   plan of operations   over the twelvemonth period commencing upon the effective date of this prospectus we intend to develop our corporate website and the messagebgone application mba in addition to launching sales and marketing activities   within  days of this prospectus becoming effective we intend to design the look and feel of our website we will use a third party design service like  designs or a similar service to design our website our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on page    within  days of this prospectus becoming effective we will hire a third party development firm to build our website and develop the mba we anticipate hiring a firm located in eastern europe india or china to undertake these tasks we expect the initial release of the mba within  days of this prospectus becoming effective we will initially develop the mba for use on both the windows and mac platforms and will seek to develop the mba for use on osi and android platforms in the future our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on page           within  days of this prospectus becoming effective we anticipate developing our marketing materials user guide and sales guide we will also research publications that cater to our target market and attempt to get editorials in these publications to create additional product awareness our marketing efforts will be primarily internetbased and may include some or all of the following     · display advertising  using web banners or banner advertisements placed on thirdparty websites to drive traffic to our website and thereby increase awareness for our proposed products         · search engine marketing  promoting our website by increasing its visibility in search engines through the use of paid placement contextual advertising and paid inclusion or through the use of free search engine optimization techniques         · search engine optimization  improving the visibility of our website in search engines via natural or unpaid organic or algorithmic search results         · social media marketing – seeking to increase and gain traffic and attention to our website through creating and maintaining a presence on a variety of social media sites   traditional eproduct marketing utilizing social media nonspam email fax blasts and press releases will also be utilized to increase product awareness our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on page  we expect to complete this phase within  days of the effective date of this prospectus   we may attempt to raise additional money through private placements public offerings or longterm loans in order to expand and enhance our proposed product offerings enhance our presence in the marketplace enter into different facets of the marketplace increase our product sales and grow our business we will also continue to refine our proposed product and optimize our internedbased marketing efforts from the market feedback we expect to receive we do not at this point in time have cost or timing estimates for these endeavors   at present arraya wilaiphan our sole officer and director through his investment in our common stock has invested  in our company mr wilaiphan is willing to make additional financial commitments if required but the total amount that he is willing to invest has not yet been determined at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering however we intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the overthecounter bulletin board or the otc markets for which there is no assurance if we need additional cash but are unable to raise it we will either suspend development and marketing operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely other than as described in this paragraph we have no other financing plans   if we are unable to complete any phase of our development or marketing efforts because we do not have enough capital we will cease our development and or marketing operations until we raise sufficient funds attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult as such if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment   we do not plan to hire additional employees at this time our sole officer and director will be responsible for the initial phases of our plan of operations once we are ready to begin development of our website and the mba we plan to hire independent consultants to do so   we have no current plans preliminary or otherwise to merge with any other entity          liquidity and capital resources   as of august   we had  in cash on hand and in the bank we believe that this amount will clearly not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months and as such we will need to raise proceeds through this offering or our sole officer and director will need to make additional financial commitments to our company neither of which is guaranteed our sole officer and director arraya wilaiphan has agreed to lend the company up to  in funds so it can remain a current issuer there is no written agreement with mr wilaiphan the company will be able to conduct its business with current funding for an additional three quarters at its rate of expenditure   in order for us to completely satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months if this offering is not fully subscribed we will require additional equity financing most likely in the form of private placements of common stock there is no additional offering planned at present    we believe that if subsequent private placements are successful this may allow us to operate our business to a point where we are generating sales revenues however additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and thus we could fail to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months   if we are unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through private placements we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be extremely difficult and perhaps impossible for a new developmentstage company to secure however if such financing were to be available because we are a developmentstage company with little or no operations we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with highrisk loans and be subject to abovemarket interest rates at such time as these funds may be required we would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth in addition to managing the debt load if we cannot raise additional proceeds through private placements or debt financings we would be required to cease business operations as a result an investor would lose all of their investment   the staged development of our business operations including our website and the mba will continue over the twelvemonth period immediately following the effective date of our registration statement other than hiring independent consultants to design and develop our website and the mba and engage in marketing activities we do not anticipate hiring any other independent consultants we do not expect to purchase any significant equipment or facilities and we do not anticipate hiring any employees our current material commitments include the total costs of the planned offering as provided herein estimated at    our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated any revenues and no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing anticipated in this offering accordingly we must raise cash from sources other than from the sale of our proposed communications product our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering we must raise cash to implement our business strategy and stay in business if this offering is not fully subscribed we will likely not have adequate funds for us to operate for at least twelve months in addition to raising additional capital our success or failure will be determined by our ability to launch our website develop the mba and successfully market and sell the mba   offbalance sheet arrangements   we currently have no offbalance sheet arrangements including outstanding derivative financial statements offbalance sheet guarantees interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts we do not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts   intellectual property   we intend in due course subject to legal advice to apply for trademark protection andor copyright protection in the united states canada and other jurisdictions   we intend to aggressively assert our rights under trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property including product design product research and concepts and recognized trademarks these rights are protected through the acquisition of trademark registrations the maintenance of copyrights and where appropriate litigation against those who are in our opinion infringing these rights          while there can be no assurance that registered trademarks and copyrights will protect our proprietary information we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to and diversion of effort by our company we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy   regulatory matters   we are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations of data storage in general the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory andor supervisory requirements   environmental laws   we have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws   market for common equity and related stockholder matters   there is currently no trading market for our common stock we do not have any common stock subject to outstanding options or warrants and there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into our common stock none of our issued and outstanding common stock is eligible for sale pursuant to rule  under the securities act of  rule  as currently in effect allows a person who has beneficially owned shares of a companys common stock for at least twelve months to sell within any threemonth period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of

of the subject companys common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on form  with respect to the sale   sales of common stock under rule  are also subject to manner of sale provisions notice requirements and the subject company must be current in its public information filings   under rule k a person who is not one of the subject companys affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least two years is entitled to sell shares without complying with the manner of sale public information volume limitation or notice provisions of rule    as of the date of this prospectus persons who are our affiliates hold  shares of our common stock that may be sold pursuant to rule  after august   rule  applies to the  shares of our common stock except that subparagraph k of rule  states that all shares owned by affiliates will continue to be subject to the resale limitations imposed by rule  for so long as the shareholder remains an affiliate of our company three months after such persons cease to be affiliates of our company sales may be made after the twoyear period from the issue date without rule  limitations under rule k   we are registering  shares of our common stock under the securities act of  as amended for sale there is currently one holder of record of our common stock   we have not declared any dividends on our common stock since the inception of our company there is no restriction in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that will limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock however we do not anticipate declaring and paying dividends to our shareholders in the near or foreseeable future          shares of our common stock may be subject to rules adopted by the us securities and exchange commission which regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stock is defined to be any equity security that has a market price less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions if we establish a trading market for our common stock our common stock will most likely be covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or an annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a format prescribed by the us securities and exchange commission this document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock marketplace the brokerdealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to trade our securities   interests of named experts and counsel   no expert or counsel is named in this prospectus

misstatement the company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting our audits included consideration of internal control over fmancial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal

also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall fmancial statement presentation we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion   in our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the financial position of messagebgone inc as of august   and the

end of august  the company intends to develop market and sell the most secure closed pointtopoint messaging system available today   going concern   to date the company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of  as at august   the company has working capital equity of  the company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations accordingly these factors raise substantial doubt as to the companys ability to continue as a going concern the company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required as of august   the company has funded initial expensed through advances from the president these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty   note  – summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the financial statements present the balance sheet statements of operations stockholders equity and cash flows of the company these financial statements are presented in the united states dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states   use of estimates and assumptions   preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less the company did not have cash equivalents as of august     financial instruments   all significant financial assets financial liabilities and equity instruments of the company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows interest rate risk and credit risk where practical the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed          loss per common share   the basic earnings loss per share are calculated by dividing the companys net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year the diluted earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the companys net income loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity diluted earnings loss per share are the same as basic earnings loss per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the company   income taxes   the company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment   stockbased compensation   the company follows asc  stock compensation which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions asc  is a revision to sfas no  accounting for stockbased compensation and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinionno  accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance asc  requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award with limited exceptions incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized the company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options as at august   the company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options accordingly no stockbased compensation has been recorded to date   recent accounting pronouncements   in august  the fasb issued asu no  presentation of financial statements – going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern asu  asu  which is effective for annual reporting periods ending after december   extends the responsibility for performing the goingconcern assessment to management and contains guidance on how to perform a goingconcern assessment and when goingconcern disclosures would be required under us gaap the company does not anticipate that the adoption of asu  will have a material impact on its financial statements   in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  development stage entities topic  elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including an amendment to variable interest entities guidance in topic  consolidation asu  asu  removes the definition of a development stage entity from the asc thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from gaap in addition asu  eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information in the statements of operations cash flows and stockholders equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity  disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage asu  is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein early adoption is permitted the company has elected to adopt asu  effective with this registration statement on form s and its adoption resulted in the removal of previously required development stage disclosures          note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   recent accounting pronouncements continued   the company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations   note  – capital stock   the companys capitalization is  common shares with a par value of  per share no preferred shares have been authorized or issued   as of august   the company has not granted any stock options and has not recorded any stockbased compensation   on august   the company issued  common shares at  per share to the sole director and president of the company for cash proceeds of    note  – income taxes   a reconciliation of the provision for income taxes at the united states federal statutory rate compared to the companys income tax expense as reported is as follows       august             net loss before income taxes      income tax rate     income tax recovery       nondeductible        valuation allowance change                  provision for income taxes    –             the significant components of deferred income tax assets at august   are as follows       august     net operating loss carryforward       valuation allowance                 net deferred income tax asset    –     the amount taken into income as deferred income tax assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carry forwards that is more likelythannot to be realized from future operations the company has chosen to provide a full valuation allowance against all available income tax loss carry forwards the company has recognized a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset since the company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years the valuation allowance is reviewed annually when circumstances change and which cause a change in managements judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income   as of august   the company has no unrecognized income tax benefits the companys policy for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items as tax expense no interest or penalties have been recorded during the year ended august   no interest or penalties have been accrued as of august   as of august   the company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions   the tax year from  and forward remain open to examination by federal and state authorities due to net operating loss and credit carry forwards the company is

marketcompetition analysis   some of the weakest links in computer security result from the combination of computers utilizing operating systems such as windows and osi together with web browsers such as safari ™ and explorer ™ with a multitude of known and everemerging security issues any messaging system running within a web browser can only be as secure as the browser itself and can readily lend itself to security breaches due to browser security shortcomings rather than security issues with the computer program itself therefore instead of being a web browserbased computer application the mba will function as a lowlevel application that will not interact with either computer operating systems or web browsers   by writing lowlevel code that will operate independently below a computers operating system and outside of any web browser there is little chance that a breach of the operating system or browser security will have any impact on the security of the mba for added security we intend to block the functionality of some operating system hot keys such as print screen and screen capture to assist in the containment of the received message we will also recommend other security precautions to our users in an effort to help them identify and remove malware keylogging technologies and other types of spyware that could affect a mba users message security   every message and attachment sent via the mba will be encrypted on the users desktop utilizing aes  bit encryption and will then be uploaded to be stored on the messagebgone server where it will remain encrypted until downloaded and unencrypted by the recipient mba user additional security features will include no message logging no password logging and no internet protocol logging or retention additionally when a message is deleted from the messagebgone server it is truly gone forever no copies of the message will ever be stored on either the senders or the recipients computer   the mba will allow a user to compose and send messages in the format of email attaching a pdf if desired and view messages and pdf attachments only in the mba there will be no way to save a message or an attachment  only the ability to view it once the messages intended recipient downloads unencrypts and views the message andor attachment it will be automatically deleted from the messagebgone server forever when the recipient closes their mba if a message is sent to a user and is undelivered for a period of five days individual users may choose a shorter auto delete period it will be also be permanently deleted from the server the messagebgone server and the mba will have no directory of users therefore a message author will need to know the mba address of the recipient and type it into the application on the creation of every message once a message is opened in the mba it will remain on the users screen for five minutes and will then permanently autodelete additionally the application will close in  seconds if there is no user interaction   the company will setup severs in various countries depending on the most favorable hosting and security issues for example germany does not require severs to store a traffic logs of ip addresses and visitors the website that will be designed to allow customers to subscribe to and download the mba service and will accept both traditional credit cards paypal and alternative bitcoins hyper wallets payment methods that will give customers additional levels of security with the option of total anonymity if an mba customer should choose to use an anonymous payment system such as bitcoins this mba user would be anonymous even to us should an mba user also choose to utilize their own onetime aes  bit encryption key for every message they would enjoy the greatest level of security and anonymity available in the industry as it could take hundreds or even thousands of years to decrypt a single message if it were ever to be intercepted              table

increase our product sales and grow our business we will also continue to refine our proposed product and optimize our internedbased marketing efforts from the market feedback we expect to receive we do not at this point in time have cost or timing estimates for these endeavors   at present arraya wilaiphan an officer and director through his investment in our common stock has invested  in our company mr wilaiphan is willing to make additional financial commitments if required but the total amount that he is willing to invest has not yet been determined at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering however we intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the overthecounter bulletin board or the otc markets for which there is no assurance if we need additional cash but are unable to raise it we will either suspend development and marketing operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely other than as described in this paragraph we have no other financing plans   if we are unable to complete any phase of our development or marketing efforts because we do not have enough capital we will cease our development and or marketing operations until we raise sufficient funds attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult as such if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment   an officer and director will be responsible for the initial phases of our plan of operations once we are ready to begin development of our website and the mba we plan to hire independent consultants to do so              table of contents      going concern   our auditor has indicated in their reports on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended august   and august   that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations deficit in equity and the need to raise additional capital to fund operations a “going concern” opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities   results of operations   fiscal year ended august   compared to the period from august   date of inception to august     we did not earn any revenues from august   inception to august     expenses for the year ended august   totaled  consisting primarily of office and general expenses of  and professional fees of  resulting in a net loss of  expenses for the period from august   date of inception to august   totaled  consisting primarily of office and general expenses of  resulting in a net loss of  the decrease in office and general expenses from fiscal  to fiscal  was primarily due to the decrease in expenses relating to filing fees the increase in professional fees from fiscal  to fiscal  was due to the increase in accounting and legal fees activities during the period   capital resources and liquidity   our auditor’s report on our august   financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business since our director maybe unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next  months we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans see “august   audited financial statements – auditors report”   as of august   we had  of cash compared to  of cash as of august   we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from financing activities will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next  months to date the company has incurred operating losses since inception of  as at august   the company has a working capital deficit of    the company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty   we expect to incur marketing and professional and administrative expenses as well expenses associated with maintaining our filings with the commission we will require additional funds during this time and will seek to raise the necessary additional capital if we are unable to obtain additional financing we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities which could harm our business plans financial condition and operating results additional funding may not be available on favorable terms if at all the company intends to continue to fund its business by way of equity or debt financing and advances from related parties any inability to raise capital as needed would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   if we cannot raise additional funds we will have to cease business operations as a result investors in the company’s common stock would lose all of their investment              table of contents     off

as shown in the financial statements accompanying this prospectus we have had no revenues to date and have incurred only losses since our inception we have had no operations and have been issued a going concern opinion from our auditors based upon our reliance upon the sale of our common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations   risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this prospectus before investing in our common stock you are urged to carefully review and consider the section entitled risk factors beginning on page    of this prospectus if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed currently shares of our common stock are not publicly traded in the event that shares of our common stock become publicly traded the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks resulting in the loss of all or part of your investment in the event our common stock fails to become publicly traded you may also lose all or part of your investment   risks related to the offering   as there is no minimum for our offering if only a few persons purchase shares they will lose their investment without the company being able to make a significant attempt to implement its business plan   since there is no minimum amount of shares that must be sold directly by the company under this offering if a limited number of shares are sold we may not have enough capital to fully implement our proposed plan of operations as such we may not be able to meet the objectives we state in this prospectus or eliminate the going concern modification in the reports of our auditors as to uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern if we fail to raise sufficient capital we would expect to have insufficient funds for our ongoing operating expenses any significant lack of funds will curtail the development and growth of our business and may cause our business to fail if our business fails investors will lose their entire investment   we are a developmentstage company with a limited operating history and may never be able to carry out our proposed plan of operations or achieve any significant revenue or profitability   we are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise and we have not generated any revenues to date any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon the successful development and implementation of our proposed communications product and its successful marketing and sale which are subject to numerous risk factors as set forth herein accordingly we may not be able to successfully carry out our plan of operations and investors may lose their entire investment   we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares   this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through arraya wilaiphan our sole officer and director who will receive no commissions or other remuneration from any sales made mr wilaiphan will offer the shares to friends family members and business associates however there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless mr wilaiphan is successful in selling all of the shares and we receive the maximum amount of proceeds from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our plan of operations          we may not be able to further implement our business strategy unless sufficient funds are raised in this offering   we may not realize sufficient proceeds from this offering to further business development or to provide adequate cash flow for our planned business activities as of august   we had  cash on hand and have sustained a net loss of  we have not generated any revenue from our operations to date at this rate we expect that we will not be able to continue operations without obtaining additional funding or beginning to generate revenue accordingly we anticipate that additional funding will be needed for general administrative expenses the design and development of our proposed communications offering business development and marketing costs   we do not currently have any arrangements for financing and our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors including general market conditions investor acceptance of our plan of operations and initial results from our business operations there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us failure to secure additional financing will cause us to go out of business if this happens you could lose all or part of your investment   if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility the sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all   because our sole officer and director currently owns all of our outstanding common stock investors may find that decisions influenced by him are inconsistent with the best interests of other stockholders   arraya wilaiphan our sole officer and director currently owns all of the outstanding shares of our common stock and upon completion of this offering will likely own a large percentage of our outstanding common stock accordingly he may have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control of our company factors that could cause his interests to differ from the interests of other stockholders include the impact of corporate transactions on the timing of business operations and his ability to continue to manage the business given the amount of time he is able to devote to our company while we have no current plans with regard to any merger consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets the interests of our sole officer and director may still differ from the interests of other stockholders   there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   as of august   the company has not generated revenue has no certainty of earning revenue in the future and has a working capital deficit and a net loss of  since inception these factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to generate future revenue will depend on a number of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include general economic conditions market acceptance of our proposed product and competitive efforts due to these factors we cannot anticipate with any degree of certainty what our revenue will be in future periods as such our independent certified public accountants have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise you should carefully consider our independent certified public accountants comments when determining if an investment in the company is suitable          we are an emerginggrowth company under the jobs act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors   we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  or the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act of  as amended for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates   we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed  billion if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a threeyear period or if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million   we may be unable to comply with disclosure controls and procedures necessary to make required public filings   we currently have no fulltime employees other than our sole officer and director although we intend to add personnel following this offering given our limited resources we may be unable to maintain effective controls to insure that we are able to make all required public filings in a timely manner if we are successful in having our common stock listed on a stock exchange or quotation service and if we do not make all public filings in a timely manner our shares of common stock may be delisted and we could also be subject to regulatory action andor lawsuits by stockholders   as a section d filer we will not be a fully reporting company   we will not be subject to the proxy rules under section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended the prohibition of shortswing profits under section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended the thirdparty tender offer rules or the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of sections d and g of the securities exchange act of  as amended if we have less than three hundred shareholders following the fiscal year in which our registration statement becomes effective our periodic reporting obligations under section a will be automatically suspended under section d of the securities exchange act of  as amended   risks related to our business   key management personnel may leave the company which could adversely affect the ability of the company to continue operations   we are entirely dependent on the efforts of araya wilaiphan our sole officer and director because of the time and effort that he devotes to messagebgone inc mr wilaiphan is in charge of overseeing all business development strategies supervising anyall future personnel including any consultants or contractors that we will engage to assist in developing our proposed communications product and the establishment of our future sales and marketing efforts the loss of mr wilaiphan or other key personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we do not maintain key person life insurance on our officers directors or key employees our success will depend on the performance of mr wilaiphan and our ability to attract and motivate other key personnel          shareholders may have difficulties enforcing their legal rights under united states securities laws because our sole officer and director resides outside of the united states   while we are a nevada corporation our sole officer and director resides in the province of chachoengsao in thailand his ability to travel to the united states is dependent on a number of factors some of which may be outside of his control these include availability financial geographical and personal matters and passport and visa regulations although in person jurisdiction may be difficult to obtain our sole officer and director remains subject to his obligations as an officer and director of a nevada corporation and the federal securities laws applicable to officers and directors of united states corporations however no assurances can be made that our sole officer and director will be able to attend any event in the united states in a timely manner or at all therefore an investor may not be able to effect service of process on our sole officer and director in the united states or enforce a judgment against our sole officer and director additionally courts in the kingdom of thailand may not recognize or enforce united states judgments   presently the companys sole officer and director has other outside business interests and as such he is not devoting all of his time to the company   our sole officer and director arraya wilaiphan has other outside business activities but he is committed to devote approximately  hours per week to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times when mr wilaiphan is unavailable which may lead to periodic interruption in the implementation of our business plan such delays could have a significant negative effect on the success of our business   our sole officer and director has no direct experience in communications or software development   arraya wilaiphan  our sole officer and director has no direct experience in communications or software development as a result he may not be fully aware of many of the specific requirements relating to these areas of business mr wilaiphans decisions and choices may not take into account the business marketing or sales strategies that are commonly deployed in the industry consequently our operations earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to his lack of experience in these areas as a result we may have to suspend or cease operations which will result in the loss of your investment   compensation may be paid to our officers directors and employees regardless of our profitability such payments may negatively affect our cash flow and our ability to finance our business plan which would cause our business to fail   arraya wilaiphan  our sole officer and director is not presently receiving compensation however he and any future employees of our company may be entitled to receive compensation payments and reimbursements regardless of whether we operate at a profit or a loss any compensation received by mr wilaiphan or the board of directors which currently consists only of mr wilaiphan or any other personal that mr wilaiphan in his capacity as sole officer and director as applicable will determine from time to time we expect to reimburse our sole officer and director and any future personnel for any direct outofpocket expenses they incur on behalf of us   we may be unable to acquire or retain subscribers   we must acquire customers to subscribe to our proposed communications product in order to generate revenue and achieve profitability if customers do not perceive our proposed communications product to be of high value and quality or if we fail to introduce a product that is customized to the needs and interests of our customers we may not be able to acquire or retain customers   we believe that many of our subscribers will originate from wordofmouth and nonpaid referrals from other subscribers and therefore we must ensure that those subscribers remain satisfied and loyal to our company in order to continue receiving those referrals once we establish a subscriber base if our efforts to satisfy our established subscribers are not successful we may not be able to acquire new subscribers in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business or we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenses in order to acquire new customers a decline in the number of subscribers or in subscriber satisfaction would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations          we currently have no subscribers to our proposed communications product we have not identified any subscribers and we cannot guarantee we ever will have any subscribers even if we obtain subscribers there is no guarantee that we will generate a profit if we cannot generate a profit we will have to suspend or cease operations you are likely to lose your entire investment if we cannot sell our proposed communications product at a price and in a quantity that generates a profit   there are no substantial barriers to entry into the marketplace for the product we intend to develop and sell   since our proposed communications product has yet to be developed other persons may develop the same or a substantially similar product and bring it to market before we do alternatively other persons may attempt to copy aspects of our business including our website design product or marketing materials any encroachment upon our corporate information including the unauthorized use of our brand name the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated against us for infringement upon another companys proprietary information or improper use of their trademark may affect our ability to create brand name recognition cause customer confusion andor have a detrimental effect on our business litigation or proceedings before united states or international trademark offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and domain name andor to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others any such infringement litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations andor the results of operations   we plan to conduct international business transactions and will be exposed to local business risks in different countries which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations   we intend to market and sell our proposed communications product internationally and we expect to have customers located in many countries our international operations will be subject to the risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries including but not necessarily limited to     · new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions         · potentially adverse tax consequences including the imposition or increase of taxes on transactions or withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments         · risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments         · legal restrictions on doing business in or with certain nations certain parties andor certain products and         · local economic political and social conditions including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability   we may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing factors in a timely and effective manner in the locations where we intend to do business consequently the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our operations and upon our financial condition and results of operations   since our proposed communications product will be available for subscription over the internet in foreign countries and we will have customers residing in foreign countries foreign jurisdictions may require us to qualify to do business in their countries we may be required to comply with certain laws and regulations of each country in which we conduct business including laws and regulations currently in place or which may be enacted related to internet sales and communications services available to the residents of each country from online sites located elsewhere          failure to comply with existing us and nonus privacy laws and regulations or the enactment of new privacy laws or regulations could adversely affect our business   a variety of us and nonus laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of consumer data existing privacyrelated laws and regulations are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations in addition us and nonus legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or enact new laws regarding privacy matters we intend to post privacy policies and practices concerning the collection use and disclosure of subscriber data on our website several us states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any datarelated consent orders us federal trade commission requirements or orders or other us or nonus privacy or consumer protectionrelated laws regulations or industry selfregulatory principles could result in claims proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities which could adversely affect our business in addition a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our business   the failure of thirdparty systems or thirdparty service and software providers upon which we will rely could adversely affect our business   we will rely on certain thirdparty computer systems or thirdparty service and software providers including data centers technology platforms backoffice systems internet service providers and communication facilities any interruption in these thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance or quality could adversely affect our business if our arrangement with any thirdparty is terminated we may not be able to find alternative systems or service providers on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we plan to host our website and serve all of our potential subscribers from thirdparty internet servers which will be located at various data center facilities problems faced by these data center locations or with the telecommunications network providers with whom they may contract could adversely affect the experience of our subscribers if these data centers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity or close without adequate notice this could have an adverse effect on our business any changes in thirdparty service levels at these data centers or any errors defects disruptions or other performance problems with these services could harm our reputation and adversely affect the performance of our proposed communications product interruptions in these services might reduce our sales revenues subject us to potential liability and thereby adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we cannot guarantee that our website will operate or our proposed communications product will function without interruption or error we are bound only by a best efforts obligation as regards the operation and continuity of service although we are not liable for the fraudulent access to data andor accidental transmission through viruses or other harmful conduct in connection with the use of our website or proposed product disruption of our communications service would adversely affect our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows   there is a risk that we may be unable to continue to provide our proposed communications product or continue operations if we experience uninsured losses or an act of god   we may but are not required to obtain comprehensive liability and other business insurance of the types customarily maintained by businesses similar to our own there are certain types of extraordinary occurrences however which may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable for example in the event of a major earthquake our computer systems could be rendered inoperable for protracted periods of time which would impair our ability to maintain our website market and sell our proposed communications product and collect revenues thus adversely affecting our financial condition in the event of a major civil disturbance our operations could also be adversely affected if such an uninsured loss should occur we could lose significant revenues and financial opportunities in amounts that would not be partially or fully compensated by insurance proceeds          we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively mange the growth of our company   we anticipate experiencing rapid growth in demand for our proposed communications product we expect the number of our consultants service providers employees and customers to increase over time once we launch our sales and marketing campaign and we expect our growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and product offerings could place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources we will need to manage multiple relationships with various consultants customers website developers and other third parties to effectively manage the growth of our company we will need to continually implement operational plans and strategies improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems and train and manage our future employee and thirdparty service provider base our inability to effectively manage the growth of our company would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   we will be subject to paymentsrelated risks   we plan to accept payment for subscriptions to our proposed communications product using a variety of methods including credit cards and debit cards as we offer new payment options to consumers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud not being a financial institution we cannot belong to or directly access credit card associations such as american express visa mastercard etc as a result we will have to rely on banks or payment processors to process transactions for us i f these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us our business and subscriber services will likely suffer substantial disruption for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we will be required to pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time raise our operating costs and lower our profitability we will also be subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected   risks related to our common stock   investing in the common stock of our company is a highly speculative investment and could result in the loss of your entire investment   a purchase of the shares offered in this prospectus is highly speculative and involves significant risks any person who cannot afford the loss of his or her entire investment should not purchase the offered shares our business objectives are also speculative and we may be unable to satisfy those objectives the shareholders of our company may be unable to realize a substantial return on their purchase of the offered shares or any return whatsoever and may lose their entire investment in our company for this reason each prospective purchaser of the offered shares should read this prospectus and all of its exhibits carefully and consult with their attorney business advisor andor investment advisor   in the event that our shares are publicly traded our stock price may be volatile   in the event that our shares are publicly traded the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various potential factors many of which will be beyond the companys control including the following      · changes in the reliability or availability of our proposed product by us or our potential competitors         · additions or departures of key personnel         · the companys ability to execute its business plan         · operating results that fall below expectations         · industry developments          in addition the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock   as a public company we will incur substantial expenses   upon declared effectiveness of this registration statement by the securities and exchange commission we will become subject to the information and reporting requirements of the us securities laws the us securities laws require among other things review audit and public reporting of our financial results business activities and other matters recent securities and exchange commission regulation including regulation enacted as a result of the sarbanesoxley act of  has also substantially increased the accounting legal and other costs related to becoming and remaining a securities and exchange commission reporting company if we do not have current information about our company available to market makers they will not be able to trade our stock the public company costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the securities and exchange commission and furnishing audited reports to stockholders will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we were privatelyheld these increased costs may be material and may include the hiring of additional employees andor the retention of additional advisors and professionals as a result we may not have sufficient funds to grow our operations additionally our failure to comply with the us securities laws could result in private or governmental legal action against the company andor our officers and directors which could have a detrimental effect on our business and finances the value of our common stock and the ability of stockholders to resell their stock   we have not yet adopted certain corporate governance measures   the sarbanesoxley act of  as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the securities and exchange commission the new york and american stock exchanges and the nasdaq stock market as a result of the sarbanesoxley act requires the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance these measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges or the nasdaq stock market because we are not presently required to comply with many of these corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than necessary we have not yet adopted these measures   because our sole director is nonindependent we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees as a result our sole director has the ability among other things to determine his own level of compensation until we comply with such corporate governance measures regardless of whether such compliance is required the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions conflicts of interest and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations   in the event that our shares are publicly traded they may trade under  per share and thus will be a penny stock   in the event that our shares are publicly traded and our stock trades below  per share our stock would be known as a penny stock which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given prior to the purchase of any penny stock the us securities and exchange commission has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions depending on market fluctuations our common stock could be considered to be a penny stock a penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors for transactions covered by these rules the brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities in addition he must receive the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase he must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser consequently the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them these disclosures require acknowledgement that the investor understands the risks associated with buying penny stocks and can absorb the loss of the entire investment penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume consequently the price of the stock is often volatile and an investor may not be able to buy or sell the stock when desired          in the event that our shares are publicly traded finra rules may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock   the financial industry regulatory authority finra has adopted rules that relate to the application of the securities and exchange commissions penny stock rules and require that a brokerdealer have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending the investment prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers in the event that our shares are publicly traded and are considered to be a penny stock these finra requirements will make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock further many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions as a result fewer brokerdealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock reducing a shareholders ability to resell shares of our common stock   if we are dissolved it is unlikely that there will be sufficient assets remaining to distribute to shareholders   in the event of our dissolution any proceeds realized from the liquidation of our assets will be distributed to shareholders only after all the claims of our creditors are satisfied in that case the ability of purchasers of the offered shares to recover any portion of the purchase price for the offered shares will depend on the amount of funds realized and the claims to be satisfied   investors will pay more for our common stock than the pro rata portion of our assets are worth as a result investing in our common stock may result in an immediate loss   the offering price and other terms and conditions regarding our shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective criteria of value additionally since we have recently formed and have only a limited operating history and no earnings the price of the offered shares is not based on our past earnings no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares   the arbitrary offering price of  per common share is substantially higher than the net tangible book value of  per share of our common stock our assets do not substantiate a share price of  per share this premium in share price applies to the terms of this offering and does not attempt to reflect any forwardlooking share price subsequent to our obtaining a listing on any exchange or becoming quoted on either the overthecounter bulletin board or the otc markets  if ever          our management could issue additional shares or create and issue additional classes of shares thereby diluting our current shareholders equity   we have  authorized shares of common stock with a par value of  per share of which  shares of common stock are currently issued and outstanding if this offering is fully subscribed  shares of common stock will be issued and outstanding after the offering terminates we only have a single class of shares ie common stock and do not anticipate creating any additional classes of shares in the foreseeable future our management could without the consent of our then existing shareholders issue substantially more shares or create and issue additional classes of shares potentially causing a large dilution in the equity position of our then existing shareholders additionally large share issuances by us would generally have a negative impact on our share price it is possible that due to additional share issuance or the creation and issuance of additional classes of shares you could lose a substantial amount or all of your investment   as we do not have an escrow or trust account for investor subscriptions   invested funds for this offering will not be placed in an escrow or trust account accordingly if we file for bankruptcy protection or creditors file a petition for involuntary bankruptcy against us investor funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws as such investors will lose their investment and their funds will be used to pay creditors and will not be used for developing our business   we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future   we do not anticipate paying dividends on either our common stock or on any class of preferred stock that may be created and issued in the foreseeable future rather we plan to retain earnings if any for the operation growth and expansion of our business

offering the chart on page    details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only  or  or  of this offering   if less than  of this offering is sold we will have to reduce both our development and marketing plans in order to try to guarantee the success of the development of our business in this situation we will prioritize spending based on the viability of the company therefore we will allocate the majority of the funds raised to first hire thirdparty software developers to develop our communications product and second to hire thirdparty web developers to develop our website thereafter if sufficient funds are available we will invest in hiring third parties to perform quality assurance testing support services and internet marketing   determination of offering price   the price of the current offering is fixed at  per share as there is no established public market for our shares the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to our shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective criteria of value in addition no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares          dilution   the price of the current offering is fixed at  per share this price is significantly greater than the price paid by our sole officer and director for common equity since the companys inception on august   our sole officer and director paid  per share a difference of  per share lower than the share price in this offering anyone investing in our common stock through this offering will immediately have significant dilution of his or her common stock   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing shareholders the following tables compare the differences of your investment in our shares with the investment of our existing shareholders   existing shareholder if  of the shares are sold   price per share       net tangible book value per share before offering

our authorized common stock consists of  shares of common stock par value  per share the holders of our common stock    have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available if and when declared by our board of directors        are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation dissolution or winding up of our affairs  do not have preemptive subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights and  are entitled to one noncumulative vote per share on all matters on which stockholders may vote   we refer you to the bylaws of our articles of incorporation and the applicable statutes of the state of nevada for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities   preferred stock   at this time we have not created nor anticipate creating any class of preferred stock the bylaws of our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors without stockholder action to provide for the creation and issuance of preferred stock in one or more classes and to determine with respect to each such class the voting powers if any which voting powers if granted may be full or limited designations preferences and relative participating option or other special rights and the qualifications limitations or restrictions relating thereto   preemptive rights and noncumulative voting   our stockholders do not have preemptive rights to acquire additional shares of stock or securities convertible into shares of stock issued by our company also our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights which means that the holders of more than  of the outstanding shares voting for the election of directors can elect all of the directors to be elected if they so choose and in that event the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors after this offering is completed if fully subscribed arraya wilaiphan our present stockholder will own  of our outstanding shares          cash dividends   as of the date of this prospectus we have not declared or paid any cash dividends to stockholders the declaration of any future cash dividend will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings if any our capital requirements and financial position our general economic condition and other pertinent conditions it is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but rather to reinvest future earnings if any in our business operations   antitakeover provisions   there are no nevada antitakeover provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control sections  through  of the nevada revised statutes relate to control share acquisitions that may delay so as to make it more difficult to acquire our company or change the control of our company however these provisions only apply when we have  or more stockholders of record at least  of whom have addresses in the state of nevada appearing on our stock ledger and we do business in nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation neither of the foregoing events seems likely to occur currently we have no nevada shareholders and since this offering will not be made in the state of nevada no shares will be sold to nevada residents further we do not do business in nevada directly or through an affiliate corporation and we do not intend to do business in the state of nevada in the future accordingly there are no antitakeover provisions that have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition or a change in our control   stock transfer agent   we have not engaged the services of a transfer agent at this time however within the next twelve months we anticipate doing so until a transfer agent is retained we will act as our own transfer agent   legal proceedings   we are not a party to any material legal proceedings and to our knowledge no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by any party   description of business   business development   we are a developmentstage company incorporated on august   in the state of nevada with a fiscal year end of august  we do not own or lease any property the only employee of the company is its sole officer and director arraya wilaiphan we are a developmentstage company that intends to develop market and sell a subscription communications service providing secure pointtopoint email messages and attachments to date our operations have been limited to researching the marketplace for our proposed communications product and the issues entailed in developing this product as well as the preliminary design and development of our website we have not yet implemented our business model or undertaken development of our proposed communications product to date we have generated no revenues from our operations   our business   we intend to develop launch market and sell via subscription what will be depending on user preferences the most secure closed pointtopoint email system available today at the present time privacy breeches in communications between friends family members corporate employees and even lovers are daily events malicious attacks on personal and corporate data are difficult to control particularly given todays open communications services and cloud storage offerings our proposed closed messaging system will be designed to alleviate the majority of security concerns inherent in the most popular open style text and email communications systems available today          our proposed messagebgone application mba is not an email system per se nor is it a replacement for conventional email and will not accept messages sent through other email or communications providers the mba will also not permit messages to be sent via interface with other email or communications providers only email messages created within the mba application and sent between mba users will be allowed this will create a completely closed and secure pointtopoint communications system between mba subscribers allowing them to send unlimited messages in the format of email together with portable document format pdf attachments if desired once subscribed an mba user will be able to download either a windows or macbased software application that will facilitate the exchange of secure encrypted messages and attachments between mba subscribers within the closed system   market opportunity   some of the weakest links in computer security result from the combination of computers utilizing operating systems such as windows and osi together with web browsers such as safari ™ and explorer ™ with a multitude of known and everemerging security issues any messaging system running within a web browser can only be as secure as the browser itself and can readily lend itself to security breeches due to browser security shortcomings rather than security issues with the computer program itself therefore instead of being a web browserbased computer application the mba will function as a lowlevel application that will not interact with either computer operating systems or web browsers   by writing lowlevel code that will operate independently below a computers operating system and outside of any web browser there is little chance that a breech of the operating system or browser security will have any impact on the security of the mba for added security we intend to block the functionality of some operating system hot keys such as print screen and screen capture to assist in the containment of the received message we will also recommend other security precautions to our users in an effort to help them identify and remove malware keylogging technologies and other types of spyware that could affect a mba users message security   every message and attachment sent via the mba will be encrypted on the users desktop utilizing aes  bit encryption and will then be uploaded to be stored on the messagebgone server where it will remain encrypted until downloaded and unencrypted by the recipient mba user additional security features will include no message logging no password logging and no internet protocol logging or retention additionally when a message is deleted from the messagebgone server it is truly gone forever no copies of the message will ever be stored on either the senders or the recipients computer   the mba will allow a user to compose and send messages in the format of email attaching a pdf if desired and view messages and pdf attachments only in the mba there will be no way to save a message or an attachment  only the ability to view it once the messages intended recipient downloads unencrypts and views the message andor attachment it will be automatically deleted from the messagebgone server forever when the recipient closes their mba if a message is sent to a user and is undelivered for a period of five days individual users may choose a shorter auto delete period it will be also be permanently deleted from the server the messagebgone server and the mba will have no directory of users therefore a message author will need to know the mba address of the recipient and type it into the application on the creation of every message once a message is opened in the mba it will remain on the users screen for five minutes and will then permanently autodelete additionally the application will close in  seconds if there is no user interaction   the company will setup severs in various countries depending on the most favorable hosting and security issues for example germany does not require severs to store a traffic logs of ip addresses and visitors the website that will be designed to allow customers to subscribe to and download the mba service and will accept both traditional credit cards paypal and alternative bitcoins hyper wallets payment methods that will give customers additional levels of security with the option of total anonymity if a mba customer should choose to use an anonymous payment system such as bitcoins this mba user would be anonymous even to us should an mba user also choose to utilize their own onetime aes  bit encryption key for every message they would enjoy the greatest level of security and anonymity available in the industry as it could take hundreds or even thousands of years to decrypt a single message if it where ever to be intercepted          employees and employment agreements   we have no employees other than our sole officer and director arraya wilaiphan mr wilaiphan is also employed elsewhere has the flexibility to work on our company approximately fifteen hours per week and may be prepared to devote additional time to our operations if required   we presently do not have pension health annuity insurance stock options profit sharing or similar benefit plans however we may adopt such plans in the future there are presently no personal benefits available to our director for time spent as a director   managements discussion and analysis or plan of operation   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this registration statement and prospectus the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this registration statement and prospectus particularly in the section entitled risk factors which begins on page     our audited financial statements are stated in us dollars and are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap   company overview   we are a developmentstage company that intends to provide a subscriptionbased highly secure closed pointtopoint communications service for messages and attachments we have recently commenced business operations and have not generated any revenues to date   plan of operations   over the twelvemonth period commencing upon the effective date of this prospectus we intend to develop our corporate website and the messagebgone application mba in addition to launching sales and marketing activities   within  days of this prospectus becoming effective we intend to design the look and feel of our website we will use a third party design service like  designs or a similar service to design our website our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on page    within  days of this prospectus becoming effective we will hire a third party development firm to build our website and develop the mba we anticipate hiring a firm located in eastern europe india or china to undertake these tasks we expect the initial release of the mba within  days of this prospectus becoming effective we will initially develop the mba for use on both the windows and mac platforms and will seek to develop the mba for use on osi and android platforms in the future our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on page            within  days of this prospectus becoming effective we anticipate developing our marketing materials user guide and sales guide we will also research publications that cater to our target market and attempt to get editorials in these publications to create additional product awareness our marketing efforts will be primarily internetbased and may include some or all of the following     · display advertising  using web banners or banner advertisements placed on thirdparty websites to drive traffic to our website and thereby increase awareness for our proposed products         · search engine marketing  promoting our website by increasing its visibility in search engines through the use of paid placement contextual advertising and paid inclusion or through the use of free search engine optimization techniques         · search engine optimization  improving the visibility of our website in search engines via natural or unpaid organic or algorithmic search results         · social media marketing – seeking to increase and gain traffic and attention to our website through creating and maintaining a presence on a variety of social media sites   traditional eproduct marketing utilizing social media nonspam email fax blasts and press releases will also be utilized to increase product awareness our anticipated expenditure on this effort is detailed in the table on page   we expect to complete this phase within  days of the effective date of this prospectus   we may attempt to raise additional money through private placements public offerings or longterm loans in order to expand and enhance our proposed product offerings enhance our presence in the marketplace enter into different facets of the marketplace increase our product sales and grow our business we will also continue to refine our proposed product and optimize our internedbased marketing efforts from the market feedback we expect to receive we do not at this point in time have cost or timing estimates for these endeavors   at present arraya wilaiphan our sole officer and director through his investment in our common stock has invested  in our company mr wilaiphan is willing to make additional financial commitments if required but the total amount that he is willing to invest has not yet been determined at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering however we intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the overthecounter bulletin board or the otc markets for which there is no assurance if we need additional cash but are unable to raise it we will either suspend development and marketing operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely other than as described in this paragraph we have no other financing plans   if we are unable to complete any phase of our development or marketing efforts because we do not have enough capital we will cease our development and or marketing operations until we raise sufficient funds attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult as such if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment   we do not plan to hire additional employees at this time our sole officer and director will be responsible for the initial phases of our plan of operations once we are ready to begin development of our website and the mba we plan to hire independent consultants to do so   we have no current plans preliminary or otherwise to merge with any other entity          liquidity and capital resources   as of august   we had  in cash on hand and in the bank we believe that this amount will clearly not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months and as such we will need to raise proceeds through this offering or our sole officer and director will need to make additional financial commitments to our company neither of which is guaranteed in order for us to completely satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months if this offering is not fully subscribed we will require additional equity financing most likely in the form of private placements of common stock there is no additional offering planned at present   we believe that if subsequent private placements are successful this may allow us to operate our business to a point where we are generating sales revenues however additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and thus we could fail to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months   if we are unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through private placements we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be extremely difficult and perhaps impossible for a new developmentstage company to secure however if such financing were to be available because we are a developmentstage company with little or no operations we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with highrisk loans and be subject to abovemarket interest rates at such time as these funds may be required we would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth in addition to managing the debt load if we cannot raise additional proceeds through private placements or debt financings we would be required to cease business operations as a result an investor would lose all of their investment   the staged development of our business operations including our website and the mba will continue over the twelvemonth period immediately following the effective date of our registration statement other than hiring independent consultants to design and develop our website and the mba and engage in marketing activities we do not anticipate hiring any other independent consultants we do not expect to purchase any significant equipment or facilities and we do not anticipate hiring any employees our current material commitments include the total costs of the planned offering as provided herein estimated at    our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated any revenues and no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing anticipated in this offering accordingly we must raise cash from sources other than from the sale of our proposed communications product our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering we must raise cash to implement our business strategy and stay in business if this offering is not fully subscribed we will likely not have adequate funds for us to operate for at least twelve months in addition to raising additional capital our success or failure will be determined by our ability to launch our website develop the mba and successfully market and sell the mba   offbalance sheet arrangements   we currently have no offbalance sheet arrangements including outstanding derivative financial statements offbalance sheet guarantees interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts we do not engage in trading activities involving nonexchange traded contracts   intellectual property   we intend in due course subject to legal advice to apply for trademark protection andor copyright protection in the united states canada and other jurisdictions   we intend to aggressively assert our rights under trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property including product design product research and concepts and recognized trademarks these rights are protected through the acquisition of trademark registrations the maintenance of copyrights and where appropriate litigation against those who are in our opinion infringing these rights          while there can be no assurance that registered trademarks and copyrights will protect our proprietary information we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to and diversion of effort by our company we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy   regulatory matters   we are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations of data storage in general the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory andor supervisory requirements   environmental laws   we have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws   market for common equity and related stockholder matters   there is currently no trading market for our common stock we do not have any common stock subject to outstanding options or warrants and there are no securities outstanding that are convertible into our common stock none of our issued and outstanding common stock is eligible

connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stock is defined to be any equity security that has a market price less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions if we establish a trading market for our common stock our common stock will most likely be covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or an annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a format prescribed by the us securities and exchange commission this document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock marketplace the brokerdealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to trade our

statements present the balance sheet statements of operations stockholders equity and cash flows of the company these financial statements are presented in the united states dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states   use of estimates and assumptions   preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less the company did not have cash equivalents as of august     financial instruments   all significant financial assets financial liabilities and equity instruments of the company are either recognized or disclosed in the

of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity diluted earnings loss per share are the same as basic earnings loss per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the company   income taxes   the company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized

enactment   stockbased compensation   the company follows asc   stock compensation  which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or

and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no    accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance  asc  requires measurement of the cost of employee
