largest highstrength monolithic wing ribs design freedom for oemsnew york  davenport iowabusiness wirearconic nyse arnc announced today that the installation of its new manufacturing technology – the very thick plate stretcher stretcher – is complete the stretcher produces highlydifferentiated aerospace and industrial plate the investment in the stretcher is backed by customer contracts including one with airbus valued at approximately  billion the project was completed on time with an investment of approximately  million approximately  million under budgetlocated at the company’s facility in davenport iowa the stretcher improves the performance of thick aluminum and aluminumlithium plate in aerospace and industrial applications the stretching process reduces stress introduced into the plate as part of the manufacturing process resulting in a part that is more easily machined and processed by customersin aerospace the stretcher will not only enable arconic to service the existing plate market but also allow airframe builders to make large wing ribs fuselage frames and bulkheads in new sizes and thickness for example one of the challenges composite wings face as they get larger is strength and stiffness and the aluminum plate from this stretcher will allow aircraft manufacturers to make aluminum wing ribs to address that issue in the industrial market plate from the stretcher can be used in manufacturing molds and chambers for applications such as semiconductors“this investment was made to expand arconic’s leadership in the aerospace market and create profitable growth in attractive industrial markets” said arconic chairman and chief executive officer klaus kleinfeld “the stretcher allows arconic to offer a variety of new products in aerospace we can now help aircraft engineers push the boundaries of design and performance in other industrial applications such as semiconductors and consumer electronics stretcher material helps increase productivity and reduce cost in both cases arconic will help create demand that we are uniquely positioned to meet and making all of this possible is our team in davenport who delivered this massive project on time

material offers arconic customers more design freedom and increased productivity in addition to enabling the production of the largest highstrength monolithic wing ribs in the industry the material from the stretcher will also allow aerospace engineers to design aircraft in new ways because plate of this size and scale is currently not available on the market for example arconic’s stretcher material allows airframers to create singlepiece parts which eliminates the need to join multiple pieces together resulting in better production efficiency and lower weightproduct shipments to aerospace customers are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of airbus was the first aerospace customer to include material from the new stretcher in the  billion contract announced last year stretcher material is also a part of an agreement arconic has with ami metals to support their contract with lockheed martin for production of the joint strike fighterindustrial applicationsthe stretcher can be used to make some of the thickest longest and widest plate for plastics manufacturing molds and on manufacturing chambers for the consumer electronics and semiconductor industries for example semiconductor manufacturers can use the thicker plate to increase the size of their manufacturing chambers allowing them to make larger andor more chips in the same amount of time increasing

search search why arconic inc stock plunged another  on tuesday bad pr from a london fire could be the least of arconics problems rich smith tmfditty jun   at pm what happened for the second day running arconic nysearnc stock declined tuesday closing the day down  after suffering a  decline monday so what the reason arconic fell today seems to be the same reason it fell yesterday arconic has been implicated as potentially responsible for the deaths of  people killed in the grenfell tower fire in london last week that said new facts entered the picture today after arconic released a statement after the close of trading monday   lamenting the loss of lives injuries and destruction following the grenfell tower fire and offering its deepest condolences to those affected arconic quickly shifted into damagecontrol mode the company admitted that it sold its reynobond pe product as one component of the overall cladding system on grenfell tower but it hastened to point out that several other parties were involved in the construction subsequently including a fabricator a facade installer and a general contractor in the end arconic said it was not involved in the installation of the system nor did we have a role in any other aspect of the buildings refurbishment or original design nevertheless arconic says it will no longer provide this product in any highrise applications regardless of local codes and regulations why is this stock still going down image source getty images now what on one hand that sounds like a prudent decision to make for safety reasons on the other hand it also looks more than a bit like an admission that arconic may bear some responsibility for the disaster which increases the chances that the company will incur financial penalties somewhere down the road at the very least by limiting the future use of this product arconic is also limiting the size of its addressable market for a company that was operating at a net loss even before this
