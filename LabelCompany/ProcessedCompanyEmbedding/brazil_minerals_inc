between the cities of apui and borba in a “gold belt” of the amazon as described in maps of the mining department this area has had illegal settlers who reportedly were able to extract several kilograms of gold monthly gold is found in conglomerate form yielding pebbles and pellets at depths starting as high as  feet and with better veins beginning at  feet historically large gold areas in

two subsidiaries mineração duas barras ltda “mdb” and rst recursos minerais ltda “rst” details regarding mdb and rst can be found in bmix’s latest annual report on form k “k” filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” on april   a copy of which can be accessed in the “investors” tab then “public fillings” in this website or at the sec’s website an excerpt of the descriptions of mdb and rst from the k is below i mineração duas barras ltda “mdb” mdb owns a large alluvial diamond and gold processing and recovery plant capable of processing upwards of  tons of gravel per hour of operation it is our best information that this plant was built by south african mining engineers hired for the task and cost  million to construct it is regarded as the largest such plant in latin america mdb has title to two mineral rights one is a mining concession for diamond gold and sand discussed below the other physically separated is an area for which we have submitted the application to mine both of the mdb mineral rights are located on the left margin of the jequitinhonha river in the state of minas gerais in brazil the jequitinhonha river valley is a wellknown area for diamond and gold production it has hosted alluvial production since the th century mdb’s plant mining concession and mineral right are all approximately one and half hour drive from montes claros brazil a city of approximately  people the first hour of the drive is on asphalt roads followed by a halfhour on dirt roads montes claros has the infrastructure needed by mdb and also benefits from having an airport with regular carrier service to large brazilian cities including são paulo and belo horizonte mdb’s mining concession mdb’s mining concession “concessão de lavra” covers an area of  acres it allows for the exploration and commercialization of diamonds gold and sand “concessão de lavra” is the highest level of mineral right in brazil it permits the owner to mine in perpetuity provided that environmental licenses are kept current and that mining guidelines are followed there are no liens or other encumbrances on mdb’s mining concession and there are no fees to be paid to maintain such claim therefore we have no outright payments to maintain mdb’s mining concession brazilian law guarantees the owner of the land from which the subsoil is mined a royalty of at least  of gross revenues however most brazilian mining companies negotiate with the landowner and pay a higher royalty rate as an incentive for greater cooperation mdb has a contract that pays the surface landowner a  royalty rate on any gross revenues from material mined in mdb’s titled mining concession additionally mdb pays “cefem” royalties to brazil’s tax authority if and when it sells diamonds and gold these royalty rates are fixed by federal decree and currently are  on diamond sales and  on gold sales mdb’s other mineral right “mdb″ mdb’s other mineral right covers an area of  acres in february  we filed with the mining department a detailed application with technical study for commercial mining of this area we also filed the appropriate permit with the environmental department we are monitoring both applications mdb has not been mined commercially before but prior to our ownership it has had prospector activity something viewed by experts as a positive sign in the plot within mdb for which initial commercial exploration is targeted our technical team identified both “grupiária” and alluvial gravel available for processing for diamonds and gold “grupiária” is a thicker rock mixture known locally for having a lower density diamond concentration but larger diamonds where they do occur anecdotally diamonds that are  to carats in weight are reported from such material although we have not had independent confirmation commercial exploration when permitted will be via opensky surface mining with a small moveable preprocessing structure which will filter and concentrate material for transport to our large diamond and gold processing plant we cannot estimate as to when mdb will be operating on a commercial basis although we have reason to believe it could be sometime in late  we intend to perform all of the necessary studies to move mdb to the mining concession status as soon as possible in the future there is no current recurring cost to the mining department to upkeep this area mineralization the previous owner of mdb’s mineral right performed detailed geological studies in part of mdb’s mining concession leading to the publication of an ni  technical report in  with an update in  as required by the rules of the canadian securities administrator the ni  report from  describes the existence of mineralized materials amounting to  cubic meters with the following concentrations for diamonds and gold  carats of diamonds per cubic meter and  milligrams of gold per cubic meter the previous owner also submitted its “plano de aproveitamento econômico” a bankable feasibility study to the mining department in accordance with the mining regulations of brazil we do not claim that mdb’s ni  technical reports and its bankable feasibility study are compliant with the secsanctioned industry guide  under the sec’s industry guide  no assertion can be made about reserves moreover industry guide  does not recognize the term “resources” ii rst recursos minerais ltda “rst” we acquired from two brazilian individuals unrelated to us  of rst for approximately  previously in  rst had been transacted for  million the buyer paid  million and subsequently was unable to pay the remainder because of the global financial crisis the rst mineral rights remained largely untouched until our acquisition rst has a storied history as holder of highly attractive areas for diamonds and gold most of its current mining concessions and mineral rights have never had landbased exploration performed properly many of the rst areas were owned before by mineração tejucana sa a famous brazilian mining company that lasted for decades and mined inside the jequitinhonha river by dredge boat currently rst has title to  mining concessions and several other mineral rights as seen in table attached above all of rst areas are for diamonds and some for gold as well all of them are located in the jequitinhonha river valley in the northern part of the state of minas gerais brazil some of the rst areas including one that is potentially very rich in diamonds and gold is located next to mdb’s plant and mining concession the quality of the rst areas is evidenced in an ni  technical report published in  we do not claim that rst’s ni  technical report is compliant with the secsanctioned industry guide  under the sec’s industry guide  no assertion can be made about reserves moreover industry guide  does not recognize the term “resources” rst has no recovery plant for diamonds and gold at this time we plan on initially utilizing mdb’s plant for such recovery

an industry guide  technical report on the properties owned by brazil minerals  per  pr the company now expects its brazilbased operations to be cash flow profitable by the second quarter of  or possibly sooner  pps projections updated to reflect the new tiny share structure table of contents  the company  the property  the people  frequently asked questions  the company brazil minerals inc otc bmix is a producer of diamonds gold sand and industrialized mortar the company also owns  mineral rights for gold and diamonds including  mining concessions the highest level of right to mine in brazil brazil minerals shortterm intention is to become a profitable company with virtually no debt growth in valuable assets bmix progress has been steady and can be measured in at least two quantifiable ways first in terms of mineral assets in early  the companys initial year of operations under the current business model and management team they had  mineral rights now bmix has  mineral rights in its subsidiaries as follows i  mineral rights that are mining concessions the highest level of mineral right in brazil “concessão de lavra” – all  mining concessions are diamond and gold and once concession also includes sand as a mineral ii  mineral rights for diamond and gold that have status just below mining concession “requerimento de lavra” which allows the company to apply for both an upgrade to mining concession and to conduct limited commercial mining iii  mineral rights for diamond and gold or solely gold in the research permit phase “autorização de resquisa” and iv  mineral rights for diamond and gold in the phase of application for research permit “requerimento de pesquisa” growth in product mix the second manner in which brazil minerals expanded as a company from  to now is in the product mix output from our brazilian subsidiaries in  the company produced and sold rough diamonds and gold in  they added polished diamonds in  bmix added sand and mortar a product made from their sand deep knowledge of brazil  strong culture unlike most other listed mining companies operating in brazil bmix team is comprised almost completely of brazilians all of whom have been handpicked the companys ceo and chairman spent years in the us venture capital and private equity and has modeled the company with the essential entrepreneur tenets of hardwork meritocracy and frugality share structure os  as of  verified by transfer agent httpswwwotcmarketscomstockbmixprofile shares held by the ceo his salary has been paid entirely in bmix common shares  as of

sand mdb operates a fullyoperational mining concession with the largest alluvial processing plant for diamonds and gold in latin america and has the brazilian permit to export its production bmix also owns  of rst recursos minerais ltda “rst” a brazilian company with  mining concessions and  other mineral rights for diamond and gold many of the rst areas are located near mdb’s plant and all of them are in the jequitinhonha river valley a wellknown area for diamonds and gold for over two centuries rst property was acquired from two brazilian individuals unrelated to the company  of rst for approximately  previously in  rst had been transacted for  million the buyer paid  million and subsequently was unable to pay the remainder because of the global financial crisis the rst mineral rights remained largely untouched until our acquisition on  brazil minerals announced that it obtained approval of a report regarding apuiborba gold project from the local mining department bmixs apuiborba project titled right covers  acres a surface area that is  larger than the island of manhattan in new york the project has potential mineralization of  million ounces of gold read more about this impressive property by following the two links below httpihadvfncompphppidnmonaarticle httpinvestorshubadvfncomboardsreadmsgaspxmessageid finally in august  bmix obtained three more large claims on goldproducing areas  a priority for an exploration license on a gold mineral right covering  acres in crixas extending to an adjacent municipality in the state of goias in central brazil the crixas area is one of the largest gold hubs in latin america it is home to several gold mines and projects from anglogold ashanti and cleveland mining which combined have disclosed potential reserves of more than  million ounces of gold httpihadvfncompphppidnmonaarticle  a mineral claim for gold covering  acres in the municipality of paracatu in the state of minas gerais paracatu is where the largest gold mine in brazil named morro do ouro is located morro de ouro is an openpit mine owned by global firm kinross gold with  reported proven and probable reserves of  million ounces of gold and annual production of  ounces of gold httpihadvfncompphppidnmonaarticle  a new mineral rights claim for gold covering  acres within the wellknown area in the state of minas gerais in brazil called iron quandrangle the closest larger city to this new claim is itabira this region known for both iron and gold mining has excellent logistics and is also close to the states capital belo horizonte

stock exchange venture listed vaaldiam resources ltd “vaaldiam” spent an estimated  million for detailed drilling and technical studies leading to the ni  geological report and bankable feasibility of the property as well as an estimated  million for removal of overgrowth on the property the total cost of development of mdb by vaaldiam is estimated at  million the link to the resultant ni  is below keep in mind that the official study was done for only  of the mdbs total concession area there is still a  chunk of mdbs property that has not been officially assayed and let’s not forget about the  ownership in adjacent rst properties that include  mining concessions and  other mineral rights for diamond and gold httpwwwbrazilmineralscomwpcontentuploadsduasbarrasnipdf what the heck is ni  read below httpsenwikipediaorgwikinationalinstrument excerpt from the bmix ni  the numbers are astounding some thoughts and reflections on them can be found in stervcs excellent post below httpinvestorshubadvfncomboardsreadmsgaspxmessageid to make things even better a qualified geologist has started to prepare an industry guide  technical report on the properties owned by brazil minerals this study will permit the company to publish information on all of its gold and diamond potential to the us markets as the industry guide  format is the reporting standard currently acceptable by the us securities and exchange commission the sec httpihadvfncompphppidnmonaarticle to fully appreciate the magnitude of the bmix potential with their owned mdb property it is most useful to look at the performance of the previous owner vaaldiam launched production at duas barras in september  and produced  carats of diamonds valued at an average  per carat in the first  months of operation gross sales revenues from the mine to date including  ounces of gold recovered for the period september  through july  reached  million httpwwwdiamondsnetnewsnewsitemaspxarticleid moreover during february  a  carat diamond was recovered at the duas barras mine which is the largest diamond recovered to date at this mine this diamond was sold in the second quarter for us or us per carat httpglobaldocumentsmorningstarcomdocumentlibrarydocumentcffemsdocoriginal rst mining permits were received on  per pr below httpihadvfncompphppidnmonaarticlesymbolbmix the company now has all of the required permits for rst area the previous operator in these areas had an annual diamond production as high as  carats in  and as low as  carats in  from the data set available the previous operator essentially did not mine inland which is where bmix will focus its efforts read the related pr below httpwwwbrazilmineralscomwpcontentuploadsbmixprjulpdf first gold yields from the rst

exchange venture listed vaaldiam resources ltd “vaaldiam” at a cost of approximately  million to the best of bmix’s knowledge the diamond and gold processing plant at duas barras is the largest alluvial recovery plant of its kind in latin america in addition to a large stationary mdb plant bmix is now transitioning into portable miniplants that are highly scalable and can be deployed at

questions q bmix dd is impressive but doesnt all this seem too good to be true why is bmix trading so low a bmix is trading so low because in  the company was in urgent need of cash to seize the remaining  ownership of the mdb property as well as  ownership of all rst properties before they were usurped by another party to make it possible in a timely manner the company resorted to toxic financing which was simply the fastest option at the time this move was essential for longterm viability of bmix then while the company was in its weakest first quarter of  historically due to brazilian weather the toxic lenders proceeded to do what they do best  dump their holdings all at once with disregard for the stocks pps the simple concept of supply and demand came into play the toxic debt resulted in too many shares supplied too fast and there was not enough demand at the time to absorb all of the shares at higher prices since that time the company has continued to build a solid foundation for a longterm successful production of diamonds and gold and was not aggressively focusing on its stock price in particular now that the production is afoot and the company is expecting to be cash flow positive by the end of q i expect them to start working towards strengthening their stock valuation as well q so what do you think is fair pps for bmix a i will provide two different perspectives below  combining revenue streams from gold diamonds sand mortar and royaltybased partnerships bmix can reasonably make m net profit as early as end of fy  an average pe ratio for mining companies is  it is often higher than that for younger mining companies with many virgin claims but lets consider the worst case scenario of  just to be conservative so with a net income of m the os count of m given the worstcase scenario of maxed out as and the pe ratio of  that comes out to  per share mm   x    reflecting upon the revenues obtained by the previous operator of bmix property m in net bmix profit for the year is very doable for  and the pe of  is very conservative considering how many claims with future potential bmix possesses add to that the upcoming hype from the penny traders who are starved for the stocks that actually have net profits and the pps potential here extends way beyond the  even at a maxed out as of m this obviously represents a huge return from these levels  in september  goldman small cap research report pinned a target market cap for bmix at  m x  httpwwwbrazilmineralscomwpcontentuploadsgoldmansmallcapresearchreportbmixpdf given that the companys current os is  the above market cap corresponds to a pps of  also keep in mind that this target was established before all the new developments for instance bmix has acquired many more property rights since then established additional cash flow from sand and mortar sales as well as developed royaltygenerating partnerships so arguably a reasonable market cap target should be significantly higher today q the property seems like a real winner  hundreds of thousands of carats of documented diamond reserves in only  of the entire area of the mineral rights available at mdb is utmost impressive but the natural question is why then the previous owner failed a to answer this i will quote the ceo himself from one of the recent interviews the issue with the previous company was that it had  employees elsewhere in brazil taking hold of ground for exploration it had huge huge research costs so any semblance of profitability from diamond production was diluted by expenses elsewhere the company also had  employees at the mine — we have  — and it had five vice presidents at the mine while we have one general manager in summary vaaldiam the previous company had  workers elsewhere in brazil in various exploratory nonrevenue projects when the  financial crisis hit the markets vaaldiam left brazil due to being unable to satisfy local social security payments and other demands initially bmix acquired a  stake in mdb and subsequent rounds of acquisition have brought the percentage ownership to  and then finally to  ownership as of today q how do we know that the ceo is not just using the shareholders here does dr fogassa have any skin in the game a of course the ceo has a lot of vested interest in bmix dr fogassa now owns over m common shares of bmix as of the last filing httpsihadvfncompphppidnmonaarticle dr fogassa graduated from mit then harvard medical school and then harvard business school trust me when i say that he could be making a big chunk of money out there by either practicing medicine in a nice group in boston or even more so by staying at goldman sachs as a medicaltechnological financier instead he dropped everything and went allin into his baby company  brazil minerals moreover instead of burning through the precious and scarce startup capital he decided to pay his own salary in common bmix shares instead of cash from my personal conversation with the ceo he spends most of his days submerged in bmix business  and what does he get in return only common bmix shares dr fogassa is a man in his late s boasting credentials that are nothing short of stunning who gave up several types of lucrative jobs where he could be making k per year from a cushy airconditioned office in boston or nyc and is instead spending his days in dirt and gravel in brazil while getting only bmix common shares in return the man is as invested in this company as it gets if you ask me q are there any research reports on bmix a sure in september  goldman small cap research issued a report in which they called brazil minerals “the most attractive revenuegenerating mining stock” read the full report below httpwwwbrazilmineralscomwpcontentuploadsgoldmansmallcapresearchreportbmixpdf q any interviews with the ceo that i should check out a i think one of the best interviews with dr fogassa was done by

montes claros brazil click here for highresolution versionmorepasadena camarketwired  nov    brazil minerals inc  otc  bmix  the company or bmix announced today that its hercules brand of mortars beat established competition from national brands becoming the first choice for use in a new story residential building in montes claros a city of approximately  people located  miles from bmixs mortar factoryfor the past few weeks bmixs hercules mortar line has been submitted to analysis and usage tests by the construction and engineering companies responsible for this building in this situation hercules mortars bested much larger providers because of product quality in addition bmixs hercules subsidiary received high marks for customer service and competitive pricing conversations are ongoing regarding a potential large sale in which bmixs hercules mortar line would be used for tiling of all of the internal areas and each of the four residential units per floor in this story building while there is no contractual sale yet the results obtained in the analytical phase of this process already bode well for future sales opportunities with local construction and engineering companies a photograph of this particular building accompanies this releaseadditionally bmixs hercules mortar line has recently been accepted and bought for distribution by pontual one of the largest retailers of tiles and other construction supplies in montes claros given that the brazilian economy is contracting approximately  this year in the worst recession in decades and that the construction industry has had in  its worst year since  the fact that the hercules mortar line is selling more every month is an indication of progress despite strong headwinds from such economic background the primary reason for hercules to be gaining market share is due to the quality of its product line two factors may explain such advantage  the high quality of bmixs sand obtained from the duas barras mine and which is used in the hercules mortar line and  proprietary processes put in place at the mortar factory to produce finer mortar whereas some of the national brands carry mortar that is quite sandy in texture the hercules mortar resembles the texture of cake mix ie much smoother this has led users to have a better product experiencein other news despite some heavy rains bmix has advanced the necessary improvements on the dirt road connecting its large diamond and gold processing plant to a new highly promising mining area seventyfive percent of the cement drainage canalization is completed as well as  of the work involved in layering rocks to provide surface traction for heavy trucks a map of the road is attached to this release bmixs diamond and gold processing plant is
