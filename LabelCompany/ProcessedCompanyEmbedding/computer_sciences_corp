virginia protests the issuance of a task order to northrop grumman systems corporation of mclean virginia under request for technical and cost proposals rtcp no  issued by the department of the treasury internal revenue service irs for infrastructure shared services iss the rtcp was issued under an existing multipleaward indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity contract known as the total information processing support services  contract tipss for information technology services its csc argues that the agency’s evaluation of offerors’ proposals and resulting award decision were improper we deny the protest background the rtcp was issued on september   under the provisions of federal acquisition regulation far subpart  to existing tipss its contract holders contracting officer co statement oct   at   the solicitation contemplated the award of a hybrid fixed‑price and costplusfixedfee task order for a year base period with four year options rtcp performance work statement pws at   the solicitation stated that task order award would be made on a bestvalue basis through an integrated assessment of six evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance technical approach key personnel project management corporate experience past performance and costprice hereinafter cost rtcp at  the rtcp also specified that the noncost factors when combined were more important than cost id at  four offerors including northrop and the incumbent csc submitted proposals by the november   closing date co statement oct   at  an agency technical evaluation committee tec evaluated offerors’ noncost proposals the irs established a competitive range consisting of northrop’s and offeror c’s proposals id thereafter the agency held discussions with the offerors in the competitive range and established a january   closing date for receipt of final proposal revisions fpr id at  on december   after receipt of a debriefing csc filed a protest with our office challenging its exclusion from the competitive range on january   the agency informed our office that it was taking corrective action by including csc in the competitive range irs letter to gao jan  based on the agency’s announced corrective action we dismissed csc’s protest as academic computer scis corp b jan   northrop and offeror c submitted their fprs by the previouslyestablished january   due date co statement oct   at  after csc’s prior protest was dismissed the irs issued an amendment to revise the rtcp’s adjectival rating system id shortly thereafter the agency held discussions with csc and offeror d and requested fprs id after receipt of fprs the agency evaluated the proposals which resulted in the following ratings for northrop and csc   northrop csc technical approach good good key personnel excellent good project management good good corporate experience good good past performance good good cost   agency report ar tab  source selection decision document ssdd at  the source selection authority ssa determined that the proposal submitted by northrop which was both the most highlyrated technically and the lowest cost represented the best value to the government id at  the agency issued northrop the task order on september  co statement oct   at  after receiving a debriefing csc filed the current protest with our office  discussion csc’s protest raises numerous issues regarding the agency’s evaluation and resulting award decision first csc challenges the agency’s evaluation under all of the solicitation’s noncost factors csc also alleges that discussions were unequal and misleading finally csc argues that the award decision was flawed and not properly documented we have considered all of the issues and arguments raised by csc’s protest and although we do not address them all find they provide no basis on which to sustain the protest the evaluation of offerors’ technical proposals including the determination of the relative merits of proposals is primarily a matter within the contracting agency’s discretion since the agency is responsible for defining its needs and the best method of accommodating them highmark medicare servs inc et al b‑ et al oct    cpd ¶  at  in reviewing an agency’s evaluation we will not reevaluate the proposals but will examine the record of the evaluation to ensure that it was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria as well as with procurement law and regulation id a protester’s mere disagreement with a procuring agency’s judgment is insufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably id technical approach evaluation in challenging the agency’s evaluation of proposals under the technical approach factor csc argues that if the agency had properly considered the risks associated with northrop’s proposed approach which relied upon subcontractors to perform a majority of the task order work northrop would have received a lower rating protest nov   at  protest nov   at  with respect to the technical approach factor the rtcp required offerors to describe their approach for completing the work identified in the pws rtcp at  the solicitation stated that the agency would consider whether an offeror’s technical approach demonstrates a clear understanding of the work to be performed and outlines an effective efficient achievable approach for accomplishing the task order requirements within applicable time frames id the rtcp did not indicate that the agency would consider under this factor the extent of the offeror’s reliance on subcontractors or request offerors to identify how work would be allocated between the prime contractor and subcontractors see id northrop’s technical proposal described various best practices methodologies and processes that the company intended to use to perform the rtcp’s requirements but did not indicate the amount of work that would be performed by its subcontractors ar tab  northrop fpr technical proposal §§  instead this information was located in northrop’s cost proposal which provided a breakdown of the labor hours assigned to northrop and its subcontractors ar tab  northrop fpr cost proposal after completing a review of northrop’s final technical proposal the agency’s tec issued a final consensus report which analyzed and evaluated the methodologies best practices and processes that northrop proposed to perform the rtcp’s requirements ar tab  tec evaluation of northrop at  the technical consensus evaluation report did not address northrop’s decision to subcontract out a majority of the work as this was not information required to be provided in offerors’ technical submissions id csc contends that the agency’s evaluation of northrop’s technical approach proposal was unreasonable because it failed to account for the risks associated with northrop’s decision to subcontract such a large amount of the work protest nov   at   protest nov   at  the protester specifically points to the fact that northrop’s proposal would subcontract approximately  of the overall work protest nov   at  furthermore the protester alleges that this concern was raised by the agency’s cost analyst but the concern was ignored or not properly addressed by the tec the contracting officer and the ssa id at  csc argues that if the agency had properly evaluated northrop’s subcontracting risk northrop would not have received a good rating under the technical approach evaluation factor id at  on this record we find that the agency reasonably evaluated the awardee’s technical approach although the protester accurately observes that northrop plans to subcontract most of the work under this task order csc fails to identify anything in the rtcp that would require the agency to downgrade northrop’s technical approach proposal because of this fact an agency’s evaluation must among other things be consistent with the solicitation metalcraft marine inc b‑ b‑ nov    cpd ¶  at  as discussed above the rtcp required the agency to evaluate an offeror’s ability to demonstrate a clear understanding of the work and its ability to outline an effective efficient and achievable approach for accomplishing the work under the solicitation rtcp at   the agency’s record reflects that the irs reviewed northrop’s offer against the rtcp’s stated evaluation criteria and reasonably assigned a rating of good under that factor we also disagree with csc’s contention that the agency improperly ignored these concerns when they were raised by its cost analyst the subcontracting concerns identified by the irs cost analyst were limited to the impact of the level of subcontracting on the agency’s ability to complete its cost realism analysis they were not concerns about northrop’s technical approach for example the cost analyst’s report to the contracting officer indicated that “since the technical evaluation does not address the subcontract costs an adequate cost realism review could not be performed” ar tab  cost analysis report aug   at  these concerns are unrelated to and different from whether the awardee’s proposal should have been downgraded under the technical approach factor because of potential subcontracting risks moreover the record demonstrates the agency was aware of and reasonably considered northrop’s reliance on subcontractors for example the contracting officer raised various concerns about northrop’s reliance on subcontractors during negotiations in addition in documenting the award decision the ssa recognized the concerns about subcontracting identified in the review of northrop’s initial proposal but concluded that these concerns had been appropriately addressed during negotiations ar tab  ssdd at  in sum csc’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment is insufficient to establish that the agency acted unreasonably highmark medicare servs inc et al supra key personnel evaluation csc next argues that the agency’s evaluation of offerors’ proposals under the key personnel factor was unreasonable and evidenced unequal treatment protest sept   at  protest nov   at   protest nov   at  the protester alleges that features in its proposal that were identical to northrop’s were not assessed as strengths or significant strengths while the same features were assessed as significant strengths for northrop id the rtcp required an offeror to demonstrate that its key personnel had the relevant skill sets and past experience to successfully execute the offerors’ technical approach rtcp at  the rtcp emphasized the importance of the relevance amount and duration of an offeror’s key personnel experience id at   offerors’ key personnel proposals were limited to five resumes each of which were limited to two pages id the tec rated csc as good and northrop as excellent under the key personnel evaluation factor ar tab  ssdd at  in evaluating csc the irs identified one significant strength ar tab  tec evaluation of csc at  specifically the agency credited csc for all five of its proposed key personnel found that they were qualified and found that all five had direct experience supporting irs requirements id the tec determined that this was a significant strength because it would ensure “zero ramp up time and knowledge transfer” and because csc’s key personnel would be able to immediately begin performing id with regard to the agency evaluation for northrop under this factor the irs identified three significant strengths ar tab  tec evaluation of northrop at  like csc northrop was credited for all five of its proposed key personnel based on their qualifications and their direct experience with irs iss requirements id additionally northrop was also credited for proposing key personnel who were identified as information technology it subject matter experts id the technical evaluators concluded that this was a significant strength in northrop’s proposal because it demonstrated an excellent understanding of the support required under the solicitation’s pws and because the individuals were “known quantities within the irs” id finally the agency assigned northrop a significant strength because the blend of expertise offered was highly appropriate for the required work id the irs also concluded that northrop’s key personnel had the engineering backgrounds necessary to exceed the requirements established by the task order id csc argues among other things that it should have received a higher rating than good because it also proposed key personnel with experience across multiple engineering disciplines and because its personnel were more experienced than northrop’s protest nov   at   the protester also alleges unequal treatment because the agency assigned northrop a significant strength for proposing personnel across multiple engineering disciplines but failed to do the same for csc id with respect to northrop’s offer the protester alleges that northrop should not have received an excellent rating because the significant strengths assigned to it by the agency lack a factual basis for example the protester alleges that one of northrop’s key personnel does not have direct relevant experience with similar irs efforts protest nov   at  protest nov   at  the protester also alleges that the agency improperly assigned a significant strength to northrop for proposal features that were accounted for in other already identified significant strengths protest nov   at  protest nov   at  after reviewing the record we find that the agency reasonably evaluated both offerors’ under the key personnel factor that the significant strengths assessed are factually supported by underlying documents and that the proposals were evaluated equally with regard to the protester’s arguments that it should have received a higher rating for its experienced key personnel or alternatively was treated unequally because it likewise offered key personnel across multiple engineering disciplines the facts do not support csc’s allegations our review of the record reveals differences between the personnel proposed by the two companies that support the distinctions drawn by the agency for example all five of the resumes submitted by northrop state that each individual is an “it subject matter expert” ar tab  northrop fpr technical proposal §  furthermore all five of northrop’s key personnel have resumes reflecting engineering experience id this is not the case with all five of the resumes of the key personnel submitted by csc see ar tab  csc fpr §  for example at least one of the key resumes submitted by csc indicates that the individual is a business subject matter expert rather than an it subject matter expert id §  moreover that same individual’s resume fails to identify direct experience as an engineer id these along with other differences between the resumes of the two offerors provide a reasonable basis for the agency evaluators to assign different ratings to the csc and northrop proposals the record also reflects that the agency valued the fact that the entire northrop key personnel team was made up of it subject matter experts ar tab  tec evaluation of northrop at  while the evaluation team recognized the importance of personnel with program and project management backgrounds the agency placed a premium on “the provision of highly skilled and experienced staff to perform the work” explaining that personnel with this type of background would be “the best way to ensure successful projects at the least cost” id despite csc’s allegations that the agency’s evaluation of proposals under the key personnel factor was unreasonable and evidenced unequal treatment our review of the record shows no support for that contention project management evaluation csc next raises multiple challenges to the evaluation of its and northrop’s proposals under the project management factor protest nov   at  ‑ protest nov   at  csc contends that these allegations establish disparate treatment and provide evidence of the agency’s unequal evaluation id to evaluate the project management factor the agency required offerors to demonstrate expertise in certain subject matter areas rtcp at   the rtcp identified the subject matter areas as follows program management project management and strategic planning id offerors were required to demonstrate that they could effectively perform these requirements in accordance with the rtcp’s performance work statement id both csc and northrop received good ratings for the project management evaluation factor ar tab  ssdd at  in evaluating csc the agency assigned two strengths and one significant strength ar tab  tec evaluation of csc at  the first strength was given to the protester for offering indepth knowledge of the requirement and for proposing what would likely be a successful project management approach for current and future work id the second strength was based on csc’s proposed use of processes and methodologies that would enable the protester to start new work within  hours id the agency identified this as a strength because it would preserve processes from the prior task order to the new one enabling the agency’s requirements to be met quickly and flexibly id the irs also credited csc with a significant strength for providing access to a large pool of qualified personnel with the credentials necessary to allow them to immediately begin performing the requirements of the task order id with regard to the evaluation of northrop’s proposal the irs assigned it one strength because it demonstrated a thorough understanding of the support required by the agency ar tab  tec evaluation of northrop at  the tec also assigned northrop’s proposal one significant strength because its “program management team is completely staffed with qualified experienced managers and personnel and almost completely staffed with managers and personnel with extensive direct irs iss experience” id at  the agency evaluators identified this feature as significant because they concluded it would result in a transition that was quick uneventful not costly and because it was likely that the team would be able to respond favorably to challenges under the rtcp id csc alleges that like northrop its proposal would involve no transition risk due to the experienced personnel offered but unlike northrop csc did not receive a significant strength for this aspect of its offer protest nov   at   protest nov   at  specifically csc alleges that because it proposed to retain the incumbent program management team under the predecessor task order because the revisions it made to its initial offer focused on offering senior personnel with direct relevant experience and because these features would ensure zero ramp up time and knowledge transfer csc should have received an additional strength protest nov   at  protest nov   at  we find the agency’s evaluation to be reasonable and equal here the record establishes that the agency credited csc’s proposal with strengths for “indepth knowledge of the requirement” “using processes and methodologies that will enable new work to commence in as few as  hours” and for ensuring access to “qualified experienced personnel” ar tab  tec evaluation of csc at  although the agency did not use the same wording to identify the strengths offered by the two proposals we find that the irs did provide csc with credit for the very features it complains were ignored although csc may believe it is entitled to higher ratings for various aspects of its proposal or that the agency did not recognize the experience of the project management team the evaluation of offerors’ technical proposals including the determination of their relative merits is primarily a matter within the contracting agency’s discretion highmark medicare servs inc et al supra csc’s disagreement here does not provide a basis for us to sustain its protest id corporate experience evaluation csc also protests the agency’s corporate experience evaluation specifically the protester alleges that the agency’s assignment of a rating of good to northrop’s proposal under this factor deviated from the rtcp’s stated evaluation scheme the solicitation instructed offerors to identify two projects that were similar to the size scope and complexity of the rtcp’s performance work statement rtcp at   the projects were to demonstrate the offerors’ ability to successfully manage and perform prior contracts like the effort being solicited id as relevant to this protest in order to receive a good rating for this factor an offeror had to submit a proposal that contained some significant strengths id at  by contrast a satisfactory rating was reserved for those proposals that contained no or very few significant strengths some minor weaknesses and no deficiencies id at  northrop received a good rating under the corporate experience evaluation factor ar tab  ssdd at  in its evaluation of northrop’s corporate experience the tec identified two strengths neither of which were characterized as significant strengths ar tab  tec evaluation of northrop at  the first strength was assigned because the evaluators found that the five contracts identified by northrop were of similar size scope and complexity to the performance work statement id additionally the tec recognized that three of the five contracts were “levelofeffort type contracts” id the second strength was assigned for identifying a contract that demonstrated northrop’s ability to support diverse integration environments id the evaluators did not identify any deficiencies or weaknesses related to northrop’s contracts id at  the technical evaluators assigned a good rating to northrop under the corporate experience factor because they concluded that northrop’s proposal “exceeds the requirements of the rctp” id at  csc contends that northrop’s corporate experience rating was improper because the rtcp’s definition of a good rating requires an offeror to have at least one significant strength protest nov   at   protest nov   at  the protester argues that because the agency did not identify any significant strengths northrop should be rated satisfactory for this evaluation factor id in response the agency contends that although no significant strengths were identified the tec assigned the good rating to northrop’s proposal because it concluded that the proposal exceeded the requirements of the rtcp and did not properly fall under the rtcp’s definition of a satisfactory proposal co statement nov   at  supplemental legal memo at  here the record shows that the agency reasonably applied its discretion in deciding to rate northrop good rather than satisfactory under the corporate experience factor the agency’s definition for a satisfactory rating expressly required a proposal to be evaluated as containing “some minor weaknesses” which is not the case here rtcp at  rather the evaluation team concluded that northrop’s “proposal exceeds the requirements of the rctp” and identified no weaknesses for this evaluation factor ar tab  tec evaluation of northrop at  moreover the protester has not identified any instances where the agency unequally applied such discretion under similar circumstances for these reasons we see no basis to conclude that the agency acted improperly in assigning this rating highmark medicare servs inc et al supra determination of relative merit is within agency’s discretion past performance evaluation csc argues that the agency’s evaluation of northrop’s past performance was unreasonable because northrop’s subcontractors not northrop will perform most of the work here protest nov   at   protest nov   at  an agency’s evaluation of past performance including its consideration of the relevance scope and significance of an offeror’s performance history is a matter of discretion which we will not disturb unless the agency’s assessments are unreasonable or inconsistent with the solicitation criteria simmec training solutions b aug    cpd ¶  at  where a protester challenges an agency’s past performance evaluation we will review the evaluation to determine if it was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation’s evaluation criteria and procurement statutes and regulations and to ensure that it is adequately documented falcon envtl servs inc b b july    cpd ¶  at  a protester’s disagreement with the agency’s evaluation judgments concerning the merits of past performance does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable sam facility mgmt inc b july    cpd ¶  at  the rtcp stated that an offeror’s past performance would be evaluated based on information from the past performance information retrieval system and on questionnaires from references listed in each offerors’ proposal rtcp at  the agency was to evaluate an offeror’s ability to manage contracts similar in size scope and complexity to the one contemplated by the solicitation id the rtcp specifically stated that past performance would be determined relevant when “an offeror has been confronted with the kinds of challenges and risks contemplated by the solicitation” id at  offerors were also required to provide a brief description of the project and describe how that performance was relevant id northrop provided five past performance references in its proposal ar tab  northrop fpr technical proposal §  the irs received questionnaires back from two of the five references ar tab  northrop past performance questionnaires at  one past performance questionnaire was received from the air force’s national air and space intelligence center for work northrop performed on an automated virtual information processing support system id at ‑ the other was from the department of homeland security dhs for enterprise network service support id at  in its past performance evaluation of northrop the irs identified two strengths one of which was considered significant ar tab  tec evaluation of northrop at  the agency’s evaluation found that the air force contract compared favorably to the rtcp’s requirements because it was a costplus fixedfee contract valued at  million for the design development and maintenance of information systems id at  the agency also found that the dhs contract compared favorably to the rtcp’s requirements because it was a  billion contract for operation maintenance and enhancement of enterprise network services id the irs identified this as a significant strength id csc argues that the contract reference information submitted by northrop is irrelevant for the purposes of the past performance evaluation conducted by the agency because its actual performance of the work under the task order is nominal protest nov   at   protest nov   at  the protester alleges that since the awardee’s proposal indicates that northrop will be performing a very small portion of the total work identified in the task order the agency should disregard northrop’s past performance information in its entirety and rate the offeror as neutral for this factor protest nov   at  in spite of these allegations csc provides essentially no legal basis to support its argument moreover the protester identifies no solicitation provision requiring the agency to evaluate the proposal in this manner id for example csc cites to no statute regulation or prior precedent that would prohibit the agency from considering the past performance information submitted by northrop because its offer indicates that it will subcontract a majority of the required work rather csc contends that the evaluation scheme it would have chosen under this procurement is “a corollary of the general rule that an agency may credit the past performance of a parent or affiliate only if the resources will demonstrably be brought to bear on the proposed performance” id at  we decline to create such a “corollary” rule while we agree that northrop’s decision to subcontract almost all of the work under the task order is a unique feature of its proposal the rtcp did not require the agency to downgrade an offeror based on the amount of work the company proposed to subcontract rather it required the agency to evaluate an offeror’s ability to manage contracts similar in size scope and complexity to the one completed by the solicitation in addition in the event there is subsequent poor performance of this effort this poor performance will be assessed against northrop so it is not as if northrop can be completely removed from this situation our review of the agency’s evaluation confirms that the good rating assigned to northrop was in accordance with the stated criteria identified in the rtcp moreover the past performance questionnaires used here directly addressed whether an offeror was capable of managing its subcontractors the final question on the past performance questionnaire specifically asked respondents “how well did the contractor effectively manage its subcontractors” ar tab  northrop past performance questionnaires at   of the two questionnaires that were returned one stated that northrop “manages well all its subcontractors be they one of many types of small businesses or large businesses” id at  here the record not only reflects that the agency evaluated northrop’s past performance in accordance with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria but also included information to affirm that northrop was in fact capable of managing its subcontractor workforce accordingly we find that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable discussions finally csc argues that the irs misled it during discussions protest sept   at  protest nov   at  protest nov   at  the protester also alleges that the discussions conducted by the agency were unequal and inconsistent protest nov   at  protest nov   at  it is a fundamental principle of negotiated procurements that discussions when conducted must be meaningful that is discussions must identify deficiencies and significant weaknesses in an offeror’s proposal that could reasonably be addressed so as to materially enhance the offeror’s potential for receiving award pai corp b aug    cpd ¶  at  spherix inc b b‑ dec    cpd ¶  at  to satisfy the requirement for meaningful discussions the agency need only lead an offeror into the areas of its proposal requiring amplification or revision epsilon

states utilities servs inc b june    cpd ¶  at  while offerors must be given an equal opportunity to revise their proposals and the far prohibits favoring one offeror over another discussions need not be identical rather discussions must be tailored to each offeror’s proposal far §§ d e worldtravelservice b mar    cpd ¶  at  as discussed above the irs initially did not include csc’s proposal in the competitive range co statement oct   at  subsequently the irs placed csc back into the competitive range id the agency proceeded to open discussions with the protester on concerns it identified with the protester’s initial technical and cost proposal id with respect to the protester’s cost proposal the irs noted that the average blended rate proposed by csc for certain contract line items appeared “very lowperhaps disturbingly low” ar tab  csc discussion items at  in this regard the agency expressly stated that it wanted to have a very good understanding of csc’s proposed costs in order to ensure that it would be able to decide if they were fair and reasonable id with respect to the protester’s technical proposal the irs expressed a variety of different concerns first the agency expressed concern with csc’s ability to “deliver the most qualified experienced resources and complete work successfully the first time on schedule and within budget” in light of an initial proposal that appeared to focus on reducing costs id the irs also identified unease with the proposed key personnel offered by csc’s initial proposal id specifically the agency indicated that the nonincumbent key personnel staff initially identified by csc might conflict with csc’s representation that its proposal offered zero transition risk to the irs id this concern was identified because csc’s initial proposal indicated that the majority of the key personnel had little or no prior irs iss experience id the agency characterized this potential conflict as a “minimal weakness” id finally the irs also noted that it was worried about csc’s corporate experience because new rather than incumbent personnel were being proposed by csc’s initial offer id after discussions concluded csc submitted final proposal revisions that restructured and changed the key personnel labormixstaffing and cost aspects of its initial proposal ar tab  csc fpr protest sept   at  the following table identifies the ratings assigned to csc before and after negotiations concluded   csc initial proposal csc fpr technical approach satisfactory good key personnel satisfactory good project management good good corporate experience good good past performance good good cost   co statement oct   at  the protester contends that the agency misled it during discussions specifically csc alleges that “in order to fully address the agency’s stated concerns csc was forced to raise its proposed costprice” protest sept   at  essentially csc argues that during discussions the irs induced it to increase its cost proposal so that csc’s proposal would be more expensive than northrop’s and that the agency failed to give csc the credit it deserved for the revisions it made to its technical proposal protest sept   at  protest nov   at  protest nov   at  additionally csc contends that the agency’s discussions with csc and northrop were inconsistent and unequal protest nov   at  protest nov   at  the protester alleges that even though both csc and northrop offered similar average blended costs for certain contract line items the irs advised csc that its price was too low while advising northrop that its price was too high comments at  we disagree with the protester’s allegations as they relate to the agency’s discussions csc’s arguments rely largely on assumptions inferences and a selective reading of the record first as pointed out by the agency the record confirms that the irs did not mandate that csc make revisions to its proposal rather the agency was requesting additional explanation to understand how csc intended to perform at the cost it proposed further the negotiation items relied on by csc expressly rebut many of the allegations it raises for example with respect to the agency’s identification of csc’s low costs the text of the negotiation memorandum stated that the irs was discussing its concerns about csc’s “perhaps disturbingly low” costs because it needed “to have a very good understanding    before these rates are deemed fair and reasonable” ar tab  negotiation items at  with regard to the protester’s allegation that the irs failed to explain why it asked csc to increase its pricing while at the same time it was asking northrop to reduce the costs in its proposal the record shows that the protester’s characterization of the record is not entirely accurate although csc argues that northrop’s final cost was in line with the initial cost proposed by csc which the agency characterized as disturbingly low the record shows that there was a  million difference between northrop’s final and csc’s initial cost moreover the fact that csc’s proposal was evaluated as having a cost that was higher than northrop’s after the protester revised its offer does not in and of itself establish that the irs attempted to induce the protester to raise its cost proposal to a level that exceeded northrop’s we also find nothing unreasonable about the agency’s decision to direct csc’s attention to the concerns that were identified with csc’s initial technical proposal for example the agency expressly stated that it was raising the concerns it identified with csc’s key personnel because of the potential conflict that a new leadership team might create with csc’s representation that its proposal presented no transition risk for the irs id the record reflects that this discussion led to an improvement in the protester’s technical ratings thereby making its proposal more competitive in this regard the increased technical ratings demonstrate that the agency’s discussions were in fact meaningful we decline to sustain csc’s protest on these grounds when the record reflects that both parties were given an equal opportunity to revise their proposals and although the discussions were not identical they were tailored to the specifics of each offeror’s proposal award decision finally csc contends that the agency’s award decision was unreasonable however this contention is based upon its arguments that its and northrop’s proposals were unreasonably evaluated protest nov   at  since as explained above we find that the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and the record establishes that the agency’s evaluation and subsequent award decision was adequately documented csc’s allegations do not provide a basis for overturning the award determination the protest is denied susan a poling general counsel  the rtcp was subsequently amended six times unless specified otherwise all references are to the final version of the solicitation  csc and offeror d were initially excluded from the competitive range co statement oct   at   the agency also decided to include the proposal of offeror d in the competitive range  since the value of this task order is greater than  million the procurement is within our jurisdiction to hear protests related to the issuance of task orders under multipleaward idiq contracts  usc § fb  csc’s protest also alleges that it should have received a higher technical approach factor rating because among other reasons it proposed staff resources with a proven track record of engaging new subcontractors in response to specialized irs requirements protest sept   at  in response to the protester’s allegations the agency provided a detailed rebuttal in its agency report csc’s comments on the agency report however failed to address the agency’s responses consequently we consider the protester to have abandoned these arguments and will not consider them further see organizational strategies inc b feb    cpd ¶  at  n  northrop’s cost proposal provided a breakdown which demonstrated that of the  total labor hours proposed  would be performed by subcontractors ar tab  northrop fpr cost proposal  we note for the record that csc did not challenge the agency’s cost realism evaluation  although we discuss only two examples of the specific arguments raised by csc regarding the agency’s key personnel evaluation we have reviewed each of the protester’s arguments and find no basis to sustain the protest  moreover even assuming that csc should have received a higher rating or northrop deserved a lower rating under the project management factor csc fails to show that it was prejudiced competitive prejudice is an essential element of every viable protest we will not sustain a protest even if deficiencies are found where the record does not demonstrate that the protester would have had a reasonable chance of receiving award but for the agency’s actions west sound services group llc b b july    cpd ¶  at  leisure‑lift inc b b‑ sept    cpd ¶  at  even if csc were rated more highly than northrop for the project management factor northrop would remain higherrated under the more important key personnel factor furthermore northrop submitted a lower cost proposal which csc does not challenge as such even if csc successfully established that an error occurred in this aspect of the agency’s evaluation it would not be able to show that it had a reasonable chance of receiving the award  in its initial protest csc alleged that it should have been rated higher under the corporate experience evaluation factor because it is the incumbent contractor because it offered more incumbent personnel and because one of the projects it submitted should have been given more weight by the agency protest sept   at  as the agency addressed this issue in its report and csc did not respond in its comments we consider this protest ground to be abandoned  the contracting officer states that the “tet concluded that northrop’s proposal was better than a satisfactory because northrop’s proposal did not just ‘meet the requirements’ it ‘exceeded’ them” co statement nov   at   in this regard csc argues that the irs “advised csc that it valued technical experience and tried to push up csc’s costprice all while pushing down northrop’s costprice” supplemental comments at

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order
