todays remarks include forwardlooking statements and there are number of risks that could cause our future results to differ materially from our expectation you can learn more about these risks in the press release that we issued earlier this afternoon and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the sec these documents are available on the investor relations page of our website at wwwsgicom we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements i would now like to pass the call on to jorge titinger jorge jorge titinger thank you annie welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today we made solid progress on our strategic priorities during the quarter with one notable exception the short fall on the top line which i will expand on in a moment during the quarter we grew our inmemory hpda business organically signed a significant oem agreement with hewlettpackard enterprise and continued to see success with our platform strategy for hpc we improved our margins partially paid down our expensive debt and despite lower than expected revenues reduced our breakeven to its lowest point in the last several years with an increasing contribution from the high growth hpda business a more favorable product mix and ongoing operational efficiencies we achieved profitability on a nongaap basis for the second consecutive quarter the strides we have made to improve our operating and financial model are taking hold we experienced a revenue shortfall in the third quarter mainly linked to one of our largest and more consistent federal customers this customer has been very satisfied with our product performance and service todare and as such we believe we will be successful in winning future business for the time being however the bidding process is delayed the lower outlook for the federal business together with a push out of two large deals is resulting in a much lower than anticipated q revenue picture and will impact us for the next couple quarters while some federal spending from the approved budget began during the quarter most of the funding flowthrough has been slower than anticipated to trickledown due to ongoing participation challenges over specific departmental allocations and recent changes to technical evaluation criteria outside of federal we furthered our strategy of diversifying our hpc business in life sciences and advanced manufacturing design we are continuing to pursue large hpc deals to establish incumbency and drive future incremental and repeat business across multiple us government agencies higher education and research and aerospace not only are we adding new hpc customers but we are also seeing existing customers purchase new products and leverage the unique scalability and performance of our systems by adding compute capacity one example of this is our ongoing relationship with total a platform hpc customer for over a decade as one of the largest integrated oil and gas companies in the world total recently increased their compute power of its sgi pangea supercomputer by adding i capacity to achieve performance of  petaflops for the equivalent of more than  laptops combined the storage capacity of pangea was also increased to  petabytes or the equivalent of six million dvds today pangea is the number one computer in the oil and gas industry and among the top  most powerful computers worldwide in hpda the appetite for compute storage and analytics continues to increase and is laying the foundation for the market to reach new heights our uv product line is an excellent solution to address the needs of the high end of this market this is where we see the greatest potential for exponential penetration profitability and future growth to set us apart from our peers as part of our comprehensive effort to ramp our hpda business and become a leading player in the inmemory market we are building a variety of direct and indirect sales channels with leading global server companies like dell and hpe and a number of global system integrators resellers cloud and technology providers these relationships provide significant opportunities in the enterprise as they enable us to leverage the longestablished customer intimacy of our partners as a result our sgi branded hpda pipeline continues to post strong growth and currently stands at nearly  million we remain focused on addressing both onpremise and cloudbased implementations for hana and we have established relationships with several of the leading providers for hosted hana solutions we are seeing strong success with this model and currently have six customers running hana in the cloud on sgi infrastructure early in the quarter we announced perhaps the most significant milestone in our emerging inmemory hpda business we signed a nonexclusive oem agreement with hewlettpackard enterprise the largest x vendor in the world to exponentially increase our gotomarket capabilities broaden our sam and capture a larger share of the asocket enterprise market for hpe our uv product fills out their suite of offerings through this market hpe has purchased initial systems and trained its sales force and we continue to expect them to ramp and contribute significantly to revenues in fiscal  last september we announced that we have surpassed shipments of  terabytes of inmemory hana appliances to a variety of new and existing customers as of the third quarter we have now shipped in excess of  terabytes while still early the high number of repeat customers we are seeing is validating the value proposition that our solution brings to the enterprise based on discussions with industry analysts we believe we now rank among the top three providers for scaleup hana appliances in the world measured by terabytes shipped we are working aggressively to leverage existing hpda partners and attract new ones to expand our reach into the enterprise we have the potential to significantly increase engagement and revenue with customers across all but given the newness of these relationships particularly with hpe it is premature to provide specific guidance on the linearity of the ramp despite the delayed spending by federal customers we are executing well on a number of our strategic priorities we are diversifying and targeting select hpc vertical markets including life and earth sciences and advanced manufacturing design we are seeing momentum in our inmemory hpda product line for the enterprise and have made substantial progress through direct sales partnerships and reseller agreements and we are actively focusing on driving operational efficiencies we believe all of the building blocks are in place for us to achieve future growth and profitability now i will turn the call over to mack mack asrat good afternoon everyone and thank you jorge i will start by discussing our third quarter financial performance and then review our outlook as a reminder many of the financial measures that i will be discussing are on nongaap basis unless otherwise indicated a full reconciliation to our gaap financial results is provided in our press release for the third quarter we achieved our profitability objectives for the second consecutive quarter despite revenue coming in below our expectations total revenue was  million  higher than the comparable quarter a year ago and  lower than last quarter the yearoveryear increase resulted from significant strength we saw in our european operations as well as continued momentum in our hpda business the sequential decrease was largely due to delays in federal spending as jorge outlined earlier our federal business contributed a very modest  million or  of total revenue this quarter compared to  million or  of revenue last quarter our nonfederal business which includes commercial and international public sector was  million this quarter compared to  million last quarter and  million last year the strong nonfederal results were due to significant growth in europe including one of our largest customer installations in the earth sciences vertical we are also very encouraged with the growth in our hpda business and are on track to achieve our goal of  of revenue from uv product line this fiscal year now let me turn to our market sectors revenue from the public sector which includes both us and foreign governments as well as higher education and research was approximately  of total while revenue from the commercial sector was  this compares to a  split last quarter approximately  of total revenue came from direct sales while  was driven by systems integrators and other channel partners compared to  split last quarter domestic revenue was  in the quarter while international revenue was  compared to  split last quarter we had two customers each of which accounted for more than  of total revenue this quarter nongaap gross margin was  this quarter up  basis points sequentially the increase was primarily due to product mix as the uv product line and services accounted for a greater portion of total revenue in addition we are being very disciplined with the quality of deals we are targeting and winning to ensure profitable growth nongaap operating expenses were  million in the quarter down approximately  million from last quarter and  million from last year these improvements reflect our ongoing commitment to continued operational efficiencies and execution nongaap operating profit was approximately  million in the third quarter compared with  million last quarter and a  million operating loss in last years comparable quarter our third quarter results included approximately  million of depreciation expense despite the lower revenue we achieved nongaap earnings of  per share in the third quarter compared with  per share last quarter and a loss of  per share in last years third quarter on a gaap basis earnings were positive at  per share and included a  million gain from the sale of noncore assets turning to the balance sheet we ended the third quarter with a total cash balance of  million versus last quarters  million and generated  million of free cash flow we achieved an  day improvement in our cash to cash cycle versus last quarter through focused working capital management also todate we have paid down a portion of the term loan and secured  million of debt in japan at a much lower rate of approximately  now our march balance sheet includes  million of the term loan and  million of new lowcost debt now let me turn to our outlook due to the significant impact of the slowdown in our federal business we are lowering our fourth quarter revenue expectations to at least  million we continue to expect achieve a slight profitability in the fourth quarter with gross margins and operating expenses similar to that of the third quarter for the fiscal year we now expect revenue of at least  million and also expect to remain profitable we believe the slowdown in the federal business is temporary and as a result we are taking appropriate temporary measures to maintain our cost envelope and continue to apply rigorous deal discipline to ensure profitable growth with that i would like to turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from alex kurtz with sterne your line is open alex kurtz yes thanks jorge can you hear me okay jorge titinger i can hear you alex alex kurtz hi good afternoon so  million comes out of your annual guidance here and i really want to make sure we all understand what happened was this book business thats not getting funding or is this turns business that you have to go win was there more than one or two agencies lets start there jorge titinger yes sure so theres two main things in federal and then federal are really two things one is an agency that has been pretty consistent close to  spender with us for many years and we are basically that is mostly turns business so there was not necessary backlog of that and basically its not coming in there has been changes in leadership in that agency and with that some redirection of the decision criteria for spending so that is the biggest portion of the delta there was one other agency where basically we actually have won the business and their data center is not ready and will not be ready on time to book this quarter so that one is clearly just a delay and then we had two international deals that basically were pushed out one to two quarters and then the other three quarters from the whole decision process so those are the main contributors to the whole delta and frankly we had a bit of a perfect storm in q alex kurtz so just to clarify that first federal agency that you are talking about would remain missed was there a shift in their use of different competitors and is this agency inside the military intelligence agencies or is it outside of that jorge titinger yes so we have not lost the business to anybody like i said earlier new rejustification of the spending thats been asked by the new leadership and they are looking at when and how to deploy the assets that they need so we are in the process of trying to understand the new direction if there is one or if this is truly just a delay but we have internal coaches as you can imagine and up until two weeks ago this was doable inside of the quarter the portion thats related to that agency so we are really just trying to get closer to the new team there and understand is it temporary is this a permanent change we are being very conservative in our outlook for this particular customer not only for q but also for the next quarter until we really have a better picture of what might happen alex kurtz okay jorge just last questions for me so this customer did not have of funding problem there was more of a strategic change in how they want to allocate dollars is that fair jorge titinger yes well we are not sure if there is a strategic change what we are hearing is that they are being asked to justify all of their purchases but from what we can tell it is not a funding issue alex kurtz okay all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mike kelleher with da davidson your line is open mike kelleher okay great lets stay on that topic for a little bit if we look at the guidance going forward is this issue the only issue thats affecting at the federal government are there other agencies that are hesitating are there other deals are slipping out in other places jorge titinger yes so from the last call you remember we guided everybody towards the lower end of our guidance then right so we are seeing some delays and we are actually seeing more delays than we expected form this pulling the trigger on that decision what we are learning is that the whole process of going from through budget to appropriation of actually having that money flow through the different agencies is slower and in many cases more competitive like who is going to get the money at what time than we had anticipated this is the only agency where we are also hearing about a potential change in criteria which is why until we understand that we dont know how to account for this as purely for how long a delay from the other agencies if you remember the one that didnt have the data center ready the moment the data center is ready those tools are going to go get installed and revenued so at the moment its tied to this one agency only mike kelleher but there are large sizeable deals that you have seen slip out that you were expecting sooner is that true jorge titinger not in federal listen in federal is only the one delay for the data center and then the deals that slipped out were actually two international deals indiscernible mike kelleher okay all right i will get back in the queue thanks jorge titinger okay operator thank you our next question comes from rich kugele with needham  co your line is open rich kugele thank you good afternoon two question from me what do you mean by criteria jorge are you talking about the specs of the system can you just define criteria jorge titinger so we are still trying to understand what that means our internal contact there are having to rejustify their systems where to be deployed how do we deploy et cetera so putting that into a category of potential criteria change i dont know the specifics right now to actually be able to answer again with the level of detail that i would like to but again this has been a customer of ours for a very long time they are very happy with the performance of the systems that we ship for years now and they have been a consistent buyer of our product so we know its not dissatisfaction with either technical performance and stability or any of that we actually get accolades from them on that all the time and i dont know how much of it is just the change in leadership that is validating what they are going to spend versus other thing that might be part of that rich kugele and just as a followup to that do you believe that this is something that gets resolved during the course of the quarter and we can enter the next fiscal year clean or do you think you cold linger into the next jorge titinger yes at the moment we are not counting on revenue from this customer for this quarter and next rich kugele okay and then mack when it comes to the balance sheet how much did you just explicitly pay off on the debt side and what are your plans for the rest of the debt mack asrat sure so as mentioned we had a  million balance at the end of march  million of it is now related to the new loan we got in japan so we have been paying little portion of the debt all along so its now down to  million at end of march during the quarter specifically we actually paid  million of that debt of the term loan rich kugele okay and whats the intention with the rest are you going to refinance it pay more down mack asrat yes so we are going to continue to proceed with our current capital strategy which is paying off the debt and we are looking for opportunities to refinance the balance we are always looking at also working capital requirements that we have as we look the next few quarters so we are trying to do the right balancing act but we are pretty much going to continue to do what we did this quarter which is continue to chip away at the debt and look for better cost of capital financing elsewhere rich kugele okay thats it for me thank you operator thank you our next question comes from joan tong with sidoti your line is open joan tong hi my questions are regarding the cash flow and then mack you mentioned that you are going to look at the working capital need to be honest the next couple of quarters it doesnt look like there will be a whole lot of growth because of this particular situation you have here why do we need really working capital to support growth when there is none and then why wont you give us a definitive answer in terms of paying down the debt mack asrat sure so joan the working capital requirements typically initiate several quarters before the deals actually revenue so we have a pretty healthy pipeline of both large deals in hpc as well as pretty fair healthy opportunities in hpda side so its not just the next quarter or two we are actually looking out beyond that to see what our working capital requirements are so as soon as we are able to say more on that we will provide more information but we are looking at the pretty healthy growth as we look out several quarters not just the next quarter or two joan tong thank you mack asrat sure operator operator instructions our next question comes from aaron rakers with stifel your line is open aaron rakers yes hi guys thanks for taking the question i was just curious if you could talk a little bit about first of all what you are seeing in the competitive landscape and on that topic this last week or so we saw an announcement out of ibm about halliburton taking some hpc workloads into the cloud i am just curious if what you are seeing are customers asking you about cloud do you see cloud as a competitive dynamic in hpc and then i do have a followup jorge titinger sure so yes thanks for the question certainly the number of conversations about deployment in the cloud has been increasing and so we see as an inevitable path to some hpc jobs will be running in the cloud now i dont think this is standard lowend cloud right so there will be deployments of hpc hardware hpc connectivity et cetera that are offered in a cloud environments business clouds where essentially the customers will rent instead of buy so we definitely see that chatter increase for example in our hpda business its not quite hpc but fairly similar we are we are deploying a fair number systems in cloud environments already and for a lot of our customers today the way they deploy our systems is in private cloud environment so we have in the past talked about nasa ames really running their large computer in cloud environments so no question i think there is going to be more and more that goes to the cloud especially some of the jobs that require fewer nodes to actually run the job so we definitely see that and one of our key strategic areas of focus for the near future is cloud so we that agree with you there while we are not seeing it necessarily folks are running they are very small thousands and thousands of users very small thousands of jobs in low end hardware clouds really bidding for hpc deals aaron rakers okay and then i am just curious when we look at your obviously positive your relationship with hpe i am just curious of how we how we should think about the trajectory of that going out over the next couple of quarters even if you can talk about any of the way of the training everything else thats involved in moving that relationship forward and when that becomes material to your overall revenue jorge titinger sure so as you know we signed i dont remember exactly but about six weeks ago the actual agreement that they hpe train i am just going to say over  times more salespeople than we have right so its a significant increase on feet on the street selling this solution we have said before and we continue to believe that with them the total revenue for the uv product line will double next year so its a very significant contribution from that agreement the thing that we dont know yet which is why i said earlier its a little too early to talk about the timing of the ramp whether its pretty linear quartertoquarter or whether it would be a little more backend loaded we will know a lot more as we start working more closely with hpe but we have had initial revenue which we frankly we are accounting this fiscal year but we see them as a significant contributor for the hpda business in fiscal  and beyond aaron rakers okay and then a final quick question would be when you look at one of the opportunities that seems to exist out there in the market of hpc looking at the ibm install base where do you stand on currently seeing those opportunities present themselves in terms of projects and bids et cetera in particular on the blue gene side of whether you are seeing some of those opportunities themselves up jorge titinger yes so theres two types of opportunities with ibm basically stepping out of the normal market if you will they are still very very good in the real highend and so we are actually winning a number of exidataplex customers and that is fairly standard cluster business for us and its pretty much open to many many of the people we compete with and we have won a fair number of those with blue gene specifically we are in conversations with a number of the blue gene current users who are looking to upgrade or move on to the next solution as the opportunity to actually move on to the next computer comes around and we have a number of potential blue gene replacement deals in our pipeline we have not yet seen a blue gene replacements todate so they are all out some in fiscal  and some little beyond fiscal  we believe we are wellpositioned with the ice x product to be able to deliver the topology and the performance that blue gene users need aaron rakers great thank you very much jorge titinger thank you operator and your next question comes from alex kurtz with sterne your line is open alex kurtz yes jorge just a quick followup for me when it comes to omnipath how does it not look not really interested about how you have executed on it in q or q but when you think about the end of the year as far as your part of your pipeline how do you think thats going to trend as we look to q and q as far as customers looking to omnipath as a potential interconnect choice in your cluster business jorge titinger good question what we are seeing today is at least from the customers that we are talking to there is fair amount of interest for omnipath  that is yet out in the market omnipath  we are not seeing a lot of differentiation between what anyone can do today in omnipath  so we have a little bit of interest people who want to check it out and see how it works but the bulk of the interest is really on the next generation omnipath so i dont know if i have detail as far as particularly the next couple of quarters of how our pipeline looks indiscernible omnipath alex kurtz okay well maybe thats setting up a followup a couple of quarters from now thanks jorge jorge titinger yes we will look into that specifically so we can answer in more detail alex kurtz okay jorge just a followup then if you guys did have customers adopt omnipath does that mean there is more dollars for you potentially in a deal whats the economic impact for sgi jorge titinger the answer is it depends right it depends on whether because as you know alex these procurements are not necessarily on a fixed price right and so we think that having just the competitive environment between infiniband and omnipath will provide an opportunity to lower the cost of the total solution right but if everybody is offering the same thing and it gets down to price competition much of the savings will potentially end up being passed to the customers and it will depend on each deal how much of a delta the equipment provider will be able to keep but it definitely having more than one solution we think is definitely a good deal for the industry and for us alex kurtz all right thanks jorge jorge titinger thank you operator thank you we have a followup from the line of joan tong with sidoti your line is open joan tong thank you all my question is related to again on the federal side just we saw the budget details came out regarding the national strategic computing initiative the nsci the obama executive order it seems like directionally the number is looking really decent i am just wondering how we should take that into  number i know its still early but you talk about federal is being weak things got pushed out none of those get lot so i am just wondering is there any read into how we should think about fiscal  jorge titinger yes so joan we are not giving  guidance yet but we definitely see growth in  in a number of areas right and one of the see the timing of nsci isnt immediate there is a lot of discussions there is a lot of definitional work thats going on which we are a big part of those discussions we are part of the group thats actually looking at that there has been an expansion of the focus not just for compute hardware it isnt just about excess scale computing but also being able to analyze exabytes of data so there is now more of a balanced solution thats being look forward to actually we think plays well to our portfolio our cluster solutions and our shared memory solutions but it is a multiyear initiative where i think  at least our fiscal  will be very beginning of nsci deployments but we do see growth in our verticals we see growth in hpc verticals i mean we see growth in our hpda business and we will continue to focus on the operational efficiencies that we drive on an ongoing basis to make sure that the growth and we see is profitable growth joan tong thank you operator thank you that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks jorge titinger i want to thanks everybody for

magazine linkedin facebook twitter google youtube rss search for northern california jorge titinger returned silicon graphics international to profitability by  pm edt september   jorge titinger’s first day as president and ceo of technical computing leader silicon graphics international corp was feb   — and the next day instead of having time to ease into his new role he was telling investors about the company’s shortcomings the quarter before “there were a lot of questions about the direction of the company why the miss happened and why it was not visible to the prior leadership team” titinger says what happened the prior quarter was that the company reiterated guidance in early december  the then ceo left in middecember and the chairman of the board stepped in as acting ceo by the time the books were closed and the earnings were announced the company did not meet guidance “even though it was reiterated less than a month before the end of the quarter the actual results were worse from an earnings perspective than had been expected” titinger says “that coupled with the departure of the leadership produced some significant concerns in the investment community” while titinger was new to his ceo role he wasn’t unfamiliar with sgi he had worked for the company which delivers high performance computing server storage data center cloud computing solutions and professional services a few decades prior and had a good grasp of the organization “i had the luxury of being able to do a pretty detailed due diligence before joining so i had some level of understanding of what needed to be done” titinger says of the more than employee  million company “i was able to focus on talking to the investment community about what changes were necessary to get the company back on the right track” following the investor conference titinger had to develop a plan to move sgi forward “it was a great way to come into the company by facing the folks that i need to keep talking to in the future” titinger says “while it was a little adversarial because the results that the company had achieved the prior quarter were not what they were expecting these are people who want to see what we are planning on doing how we are turning things around and they’ll be cheering for us that’s how i approached it” here’s how titinger came into a struggling sgi and got the company on the right track   find what needs fixing to better understand why the company wasn’t performing up to snuff the quarter before titinger’s arrival he spent the first several weeks and months diagnosing issues that needed to be fixed “i spent a lot of time traveling meeting with customers meeting with suppliers and meeting with the different groups inside the company to get more clarity on the cause and effect of the issues we had to fix” titinger says after coming into the company he realized there were certain business practices missing without those practices in place it wasn’t a surprise that the results were unknown one of his commitments to sgi’s board of directors was to develop a strategic plan within three months that would guide the company down the path it needed to follow “the diagnosis involved a number of areas how good are our products in the markets that we’re competing in” he says “how good are our processes is our strategy the right strategy are there relationships with customers at the right level and lastly is our team the right team “i had spent the early part of my tenure here making sure we had clarity in those areas and where to develop action” a lot of the initial focus that titinger had in the turnaround was putting those business practices in place “my diagnosis of the business was that there was a misalignment between structure of incentives and the objectives that the company had especially with the sales force that was incented on bookings only and we were too complex for the size that we were” titinger says “sgi today is a combination of the old sgi and rackable systems inc and the combined company is still quite a bit smaller than the old sgi used to be but many of the business practices and processes were from a much larger complicated company “so we have spent a lot of time in this past year simplifying what we offer to the customers refocusing on certain vertical markets instead of trying to be everything for everybody” he says “the essence of the plan is focus simplify be able to deliver more value to a narrowed set of customers and then clean up the internal processes to make sure we don’t get in our own way when we’re working on behalf of fixing customers’ problems” the no  thing that helped titinger identify sgi’s trouble areas was his ability to listen “the tendency to come in with prefabbed solutions will be high” he says “anybody who’s gotten to the ceo level has had lots of successes and there’s a danger in thinking every problem can be solved the same way i would caution people to not just start applying your tool set into the situation but spend time listening and keep an open mind so you learn what is relevant in this particular situation”   take the next steps the next step after identifying issues in the business that needed fixing was to focus on three things “one was to set the strategy” titinger says “i view this as a key role for the ceo you’ve got to set the strategy you’ve got to drive the culture in the company that will be able to execute that strategy and then you have to have the right team in place “my next steps were exactly down that path who are we going to be and what are we going to do we had to shift the mood from despair to a cando attitude that was buried in the company a little bit so we had to make that come back up and then we had to strengthen the team significantly given the task we had to go fix” titinger had spent a lot of time talking to customers and employees who served customers — so that’s where the strategy focused “if the strategy doesn’t start with the customer chances are you’re going to have a hard time with market relevance” he says “based on those conversations and that analysis the focus was where we can differentiate and provide valueadded solutions to customers “we then mapped our markets from the perspective of where we could bring differentiated value but at the same time determine if they were markets that had growth and where we thought we could succeed we then narrowed down the market focus and narrowed down the product offerings to support those markets” titinger made sure he involved not only the executive team but people deeper in the organization who needed to execute this strategy during the development process in order to make it successful “strategy serves two purposes — no  is for the company to understand how it can bring differentiated value” he says “everything the company does has to support achieving that equally important is what you’re going to stop doing so you can dedicate your resources to those things that you need to do really really well” one of the biggest problems companies may have is saying no to things that either have been going on in the past or are great ideas but are ones that don’t add value to customers “that is the hardest part in the strategy when you’re figuring out what not to do” titinger says “it comes back to the customer you can have a great strategy that looks great internally but if it’s not interesting to your customers it’s going to be irrelevant”   deliver on the strategy with an internal goal of three months to deliver a strategy to the board of directors titinger started in march  and in may presented the strategy endorsed by the board the strategy was presented to investors in june “the strategy in the end really had three pillars” titinger says “no  was simplification of our focus on vertical markets and product offerings no  was a shift from an infrastructure provider to being a solution provider as a company and no  was operational excellence to improve those processes that were not necessarily the right ones” today sgi is right on track with the strategy and ahead of plans on the operational elements spoton with the simplification elements and making the kind of progress titinger wanted to make “given that we’re on track and maybe slightly ahead on the execution of the plan my assessment of the company is that we have done very well” he says “we have turned the company back to profitability within two quarters we’ve gone from thinking we needed to raise cash to actually generating cash “we have a much more focused product roadmap that addresses market needs we’ve improved the quality and capability of the senior team and that has longterm positive effects for the future of the company” with the new strategy in place sgi employees are enthusiastic and see a path to success “i’m excited about the possibilities the company has to add value to our customers” titinger says “i want our investors to view us as one of their best investments our customers to view us essential to their success and i want our employees to view sgi as the best place they can be” ●    takeaways
