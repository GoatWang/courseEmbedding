even given up on going to the grocery store just two blocks away” in  this simple statement from a friend was the start of it all he was a wheelchair user who did not like the negative attention he got while using his wheelchair in public he was seen as weak or ill someone who needed the help of a large imposing unsightly machine to help him get around as a friend we knew him to be amazingly independent fun loving and very social we wanted everyone to be able to see the true person the person we knew so we set out to create a mobility device that would empower our friend enable him to be himself and to do the things he wanted to with confidence and enthusiasm a mobility device that would change the way he felt in public and one that would change how the public felt about himafter a year of development we not only gave our friend a revolutionary new vehicle but we also exhibited our work at the  tokyo motor show we were overwhelmed by the positive reaction from all over the world we realized that many people desired this kind of innovation and new found freedom in the mobility industry we saw how meaningful what we were creating could be for people with mobility issuesthis is why we founded whillthrough ongoing development and production of personal evs we will challenge today’s conventions and improve the personal mobility experience as we do we will redefine the perception of wheelchairs and their limitations through innovative design and advanced technology nobody should be limited because they don’t feel comfortable with how they move from point a to point b we want every individual to be confident comfortable and independent please view the youtube video for more backgroundmanagement teamsugie satoshi founder ceosugie worked for nissan’s advanced
