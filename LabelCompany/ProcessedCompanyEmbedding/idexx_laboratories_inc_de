condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form �k we have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this annual report on form k in the glossary of terms and selected abbreviations description of business segments we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group cag water quality products water and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food which we refer to as livestock poultry and dairy lpd our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market opti medical with our pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in this annual report on form k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas during the second quarter of  we renamed our customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems line of business in the cag segment to veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems financial results were not adjusted as a result of this name change during the fourth quarter of  we modified our management reporting to rename idexx vetlab service and accessories to cag diagnostics service and accessories and reclassified the location of snap pro service plans previously located in cag diagnostics capital  instruments to cag diagnostics service and accessories the amount of revenue reclassified was  million during the year ended december   and  million during the year ended december   the amount reclassified was less than  million during the year ended december   certain costs not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption unallocated amounts these costs include costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate which primarily consist of our rd function regional or country expenses certain foreign currency revaluation gains and losses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currency and unusual items corporate support function costs such as information technology facilities human resources finance and legal health benefits and incentive compensation are charged to our business segments at predetermined budgeted amounts or rates differences from these predetermined budgeted amounts or rates are captured within unallocated amounts effective january   we modified our management reporting to the chief operating decision maker to provide a more comprehensive view of the performance of our operating segments by including the capitalization and subsequent recognition of variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs which adjusts the timing of cost recognition from when the variance is created to the period in which the related inventory is sold prior to january   the capitalization and subsequent recognition of these variances were not allocated to our operating segments and were instead reported under the caption unallocated amounts the segment gross profit and income loss from operations within this annual report on form k for the years ended december   and  has been retrospectively

unallocated amounts  na   na total company         the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business companion animal group our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by doing so we are able to build a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues cag diagnostics we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patients diagnostic results which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution to further increase our customer reach effective january   we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our annual contracts with our us distribution partners under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and idexx vetlab consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro mobile device are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once revenues from the associated proprietary idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro mobile device are recurring in nature in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the idexx vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instruments life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instruments life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november  we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred  million of instrument revenue in  which was fully recognized in  upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx was received we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december   these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately  units globally as compared to  units globally in  approximately  percent of  catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst analyzers which leads to additional testing by the customer as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables the lasercyte dx analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in  in addition we sell the procyte dx lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers as of december   these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately  units as compared to  units in  and  units in  a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer in  approximately  percent of procyte placements were made at competitive accounts we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx and lasercyte instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and a decrease in the associated recurring revenue stream our sedivue dx instrument which we launched in north america early in  and in the uk and australia in the fourth quarter of  is the first and only inclinic analyzer to provide urine sediment analysis this instrument and singleuse consumable system provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to automate the inhouse process of examining urine under a microscope we provide customers with sedivue dx consumables that are charged upon utilization which we refer to as payperrun as compared to other instruments where we charge upon shipment of consumables we reported total revenues of  million from sedivue dx instrument and payperrun sales during the year ended december   we seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our snap rapid assay tests by providing the snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record beginning in january of  with our proread software the snap pro mobile device will interpret results these features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro mobile device results can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products prior to  the snapshot dx was our primary inclinic solution for screening thyroid disease cortisol bile acids and interpreting snap rapid assay tests upon the launch of the total thyroxine t slide for use with our catalyst analyzers during  we experienced a decline in snapshot dx placements we reported revenues of  million from snapshot dx placements during the year ended december   which reflects approximately a  million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year we reported revenues of  million from snapshot dx during the year ended december   which reflects approximately a  million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year we will continue to service the existing snapshot dx install base our longterm success in the continuing growth of our cag recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention of their recurring revenues our ability to realize price increases based on our differentiated products and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary idexx vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our cag diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature for the year ended december   recurring diagnostic revenue which is both highly durable and profitable accounts for approximately  percent of our consolidated revenue our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our idexx vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in idexx vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing idexx vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians additionally we have found that veterinarian adoption of vetconnect plus drives utilization by spurring testing across all idexx diagnostic modalities in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once including the ability to utilize our snap pro mobile device we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing the expiration of a third partys us lateral flow patent in early  enabled competitors to launch single use tests that competed with several of our early generation snap rapid assay products including heartworm rt fivfelv combo test feline triple parvo and giardia these companies partnered with several of our former national distributors to gain market share by competing primarily on price in the second half of  we stabilized our market share on these products in part by communicating the significant superiority in test sensitivity for both our canine and feline lines over competing tests using the lateral flow platform and in part with more effective marketing and promotion programs our higher sensitivity in the detection of infectious diseases is due in part to our snap platform which is unique in using enzymelinked immunosorbent assays elisa technology test accuracy through specificity and sensitivity is a primary factor that customers value with these inhouse tests given the importance of detecting the presence of serious infectious diseases in the practice we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of a unique and proprietary test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings profitability in our lab business is supported in part by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve efficiencies when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form �k we have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this annual report on form k in the glossary of terms and selected abbreviations description of business segments we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group cag water quality products water and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food which we refer to as livestock poultry and dairy lpd our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market opti medical with our pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in this annual report on form k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas during the second quarter of  we renamed our customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems line of business in the cag segment to veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems financial results were not adjusted as a result of this name change during the fourth quarter of  we modified our management reporting to rename idexx vetlab service and accessories to cag diagnostics service and accessories and reclassified the location of snap pro service plans previously located in cag diagnostics capital  instruments to cag diagnostics service and accessories the amount of revenue reclassified was  million during the year ended december   and  million during the year ended december   the amount reclassified was less than  million during the year ended december   certain costs not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption unallocated amounts these costs include costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate which primarily consist of our rd function regional or country expenses certain foreign currency revaluation gains and losses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currency and unusual items corporate support function costs such as information technology facilities human resources finance and legal health benefits and incentive compensation are charged to our business segments at predetermined budgeted amounts or rates differences from these predetermined budgeted amounts or rates are captured within unallocated amounts effective january   we modified our management reporting to the chief operating decision maker to provide a more comprehensive view of the performance of our operating segments by including the capitalization and subsequent recognition of variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs which adjusts the timing of cost recognition from when the variance is created to the period in which the related inventory is sold prior to january   the capitalization and subsequent recognition of these variances were not allocated to our operating segments and were instead reported under the caption unallocated amounts the segment gross profit and income loss from operations within this annual

factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business companion animal group our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by doing so we are able to build a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues cag diagnostics we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patients diagnostic results which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution to further increase our customer reach effective january   we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our annual contracts with our us distribution partners under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and idexx vetlab consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro mobile device are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once revenues from the associated proprietary idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro mobile device are recurring in nature in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the idexx vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instruments life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instruments life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november  we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred  million of instrument revenue in  which was fully recognized in  upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx was received we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december   these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately  units globally as compared to  units globally in  approximately  percent of  catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst analyzers which leads to additional testing by the customer as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables the lasercyte dx analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in  in addition we sell the procyte dx lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers as of december   these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately  units as compared to  units in  and  units in  a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer in  approximately  percent of procyte placements were made at competitive accounts we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx and lasercyte instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and a decrease in the associated recurring revenue stream our sedivue dx instrument which we launched in north america early in  and in the uk and australia in the fourth quarter of  is the first and only inclinic analyzer to provide urine sediment analysis this instrument and singleuse consumable system provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to automate the inhouse process of examining urine under a microscope we provide customers with sedivue dx consumables that are charged upon utilization which we refer to as payperrun as compared to other instruments where we charge upon shipment of consumables we reported total revenues of  million from sedivue dx instrument and payperrun sales during the year ended december   we seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our snap rapid assay tests by providing the snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record beginning in january of  with our proread software the snap pro mobile device will interpret results these features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro mobile device results can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products prior to  the snapshot dx was our primary inclinic solution for screening thyroid disease cortisol bile acids and interpreting snap rapid assay tests upon the launch of the total thyroxine t slide for use with our catalyst analyzers during  we experienced a decline in snapshot dx placements we reported revenues of  million from snapshot dx placements during the year ended december   which reflects approximately a  million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year we reported revenues of  million from snapshot dx during the year ended december   which reflects approximately a  million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year we will continue to service the existing snapshot dx install base our longterm success in the continuing growth of our cag recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention of their recurring revenues our ability to realize price increases based on our differentiated products and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary idexx vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our cag diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature for the year ended december   recurring diagnostic revenue which is both highly durable and profitable accounts for approximately  percent of our consolidated revenue our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our idexx vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in idexx vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing idexx vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians additionally we have found that veterinarian adoption of vetconnect plus drives utilization by spurring testing across all idexx diagnostic modalities in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once including the ability to utilize our snap pro mobile device we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing the expiration of a third partys us lateral flow patent in early  enabled competitors to launch single use tests that competed with several of our early generation snap rapid assay products including heartworm rt fivfelv combo test feline triple parvo and giardia these companies partnered with several of our former national distributors to gain market share by competing primarily on price in the second half of  we stabilized our market share on these products in part by communicating the significant superiority in test sensitivity for both our canine and feline lines over competing tests using the lateral flow platform and in part with more effective marketing and promotion programs our higher sensitivity in the detection of infectious diseases is due in part to our snap platform which is unique in using enzymelinked immunosorbent assays elisa technology test accuracy through specificity and sensitivity is a primary factor that customers value with these inhouse tests given the importance of detecting the presence of serious infectious diseases in the practice we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of a unique and proprietary test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings profitability in our lab business is supported in part by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve efficiencies when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference    feb   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch most
