which notes were issued bearing  interest annually the notes as extended mature on august   and are unsecured the company had total notes payable to the related party of  at may    results of operations three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   the company incurred net losses of approximately  for the three months ended march   as compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended march   the approximate  decrease n net loss is due primarily to the following all numbers approximate a decrease in general and administrative expense of  due to mainly to decreases in consulting and contract labor expenses a  decrease in executive compensation due to a decrease in salaries and stock based compensation a  decrease in professional fees and a  decrease in noncash losses on investments partially offset by an increase in interest expense of  if we are able to raise substantial additional capital we expect to ramp up our operations which will cause our operating expenses to increase substantially liquidity and capital resources as of march  and may   we had virtually no cash on hand between january  and may   the company received gross proceeds from debt agreements of  additionally in order to fund our basic operations between january  and april   kae yong park a significant shareholder and her spouse howard baer together park have collectively made cash advances of  to fund our basic operations  of which has been repaid in addition  of the amount owed park has been recaptured for parks use of company personnel leaving a balance due of  as of may   we continue to have an immediate and urgent need for additional capital the lack of operating capital continues to materially and adversely affect our business operations due to the lack of operating capital we are unable to implement our business plan if the company does not receive a significant infusion of capital in the near term it is unlikely that the company will be able to continue as a going concern in which case investors would suffer a total loss of their investment in the company we have not yet realized significant operating revenues we are however incurring significant costs and expenses in connection with the development of our business implementation of our business plan and ongoing compliance costs associated with being a public company consequently we are currently experiencing ongoing negative cash flows from operations cash used in operating activities during the three months ended march   all numbers approximate was  a decrease of approximately  from the  used during the comparable prior period the  decrease in cash used by operations was due primarily to a  decrease in net loss partially offset by a  decrease in warrants issued for executive compensation noncash a  decrease in loss on securities noncash a  decrease in the change increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a  decrease in related party payables cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended march   was approximately  as compared to approximately  in the prior comparable period the all numbers are approximate  decrease is due primarily to a decrease of  in proceeds from the issuance of debt including convertible notes partially offset by a  decrease in repayments on notes the company is experiencing ever increasing difficulty raising capital from third parties cash provided by financing activities is insufficient to fund the companys basic operating activities if we are able to obtain additional funding and ramp up our operations our operations will use increasing amounts of cash in coming quarters unless and until we are able to generate revenue from our operating activities based on our current business plan we anticipate that our operating and website development activities will use approximately  in cash per month over the next twelve months or  million currently we have virtually no cash on hand and consequently we are unable to implement our current business plan we believe that our operations will not begin to generate positive cash flows until at least the fourth quarter of  assuming we secure sufficient funding in the near term to implement our business plan which we currently do not have accordingly we have an immediate and extremely urgent need for capital to fund our operating activities  in order to remedy this liquidity deficiency we are actively seeking to raise additional funds through the sale of equity and debt securities and ultimately we will need to generate substantial positive operating cash flows our internal sources of funds will consist of cash flows from operations but not until we begin to realize substantial revenues from the sale of services as previously stated we currently have no revenue and our operations are generating negative cash flows and thus adversely affecting our liquidity although we are attempting to raise additional funds through equity andor debt financing we are having great difficulty in securing any significant funding from unrelated third parties if we are able to secure sufficient funding in the near term to implement our business plan we expect that our operations could begin to generate significant revenues during the fourth quarter  which should ameliorate our liquidity deficiency if we are unable to raise additional funds in the near term we will not be able to implement our business plan and it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern since early  we have encountered great difficulty raising capital from unrelated third parties there is a significant risk that we will be unable to raise additional capital form unrelated third parties although kae yong park and howard baer have provided us with significant funds they are under no obligation to do so and at this time are unable to provide additional funding in the event we do not generate sufficient funds from revenues or financing through the issuance of common stock or from debt financing we will be unable to implement our business plan and pay our obligations as they become due any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations if the company does not receive a significant infusion of capital in the near term it is unlikely that the company will be able to continue as a going concern in which case investors would suffer a total loss of their investment in the company the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be required should the company be unable to recover the value of its assets or satisfy its liabilities see note  to the financial statements  liquiditygoing concern subject to the availability of funds which we currently do not have we expect to incur approximately  in website development expenditures over the next  months included in the  million estimate of cash required over the next twelve months the purpose of these expenditures will be for the development of various websitesportals we intend to create modifications and improvements on existing sites and acquisition of additional domain names we expect to fund these website development expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations and proceeds from equity financing if we are unable to generate positive cash flows from operations andor raise additional funds either through debt or equity we will be unable to fund our website development expenditures in which case there could be an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we intend to raise additional funds in the near term from the further sales of shares of common stock additional sales of common stock will reduce the percentage interest of existing shareholders in our company although it is possible we do not believe it is likely that we will raise additional funds through the sale of debt securities in the near term as described above in june  we issued kae yong park a promissory note in the principal amount of  as partial consideration for the acquisition of approximately  cannabis related internet domain names we have since paid  in principal to ms park the remaining balance of  is payable in thirtysix equal monthly installments commencing on the fifteenth day following the first month we realize at least  in gross revenue this remaining  balance is currently classified as a noncurrent liability we believe that we will be able to make the approximate  monthly payment when and if we achieve the monthly  revenue threshold which triggers our repayment obligation in addition as described above we are currently indebted to kae park a significant shareholder and howard baer her spouse in the aggregate amount of  which is secured by the companys assets as of april   with an effective date of january    of the principal due under the note evidencing this indebtedness is interest bearing at the rate of  annually with any remainder being noninterest bearing all amounts due under this note are payable on demand if demand for payment is made and we are unable to pay the amount due we would be in default and ms park and mr baer would have the right to sell our assets to satisfy the amounts due them under the promissory note
