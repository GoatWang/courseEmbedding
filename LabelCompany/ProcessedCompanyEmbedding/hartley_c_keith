learned that on march   an fda advisory panel voted overwhelmingly to recommend approval of provenge dendreon’s promising new treatment for prostate cancer as a result most financial analysts and investors expected that dendreon would have  a promising future however ten hedge funds out of a universe of  hedge funds held large numbers of dendreon put options bets against the company suggesting they expected dendreon would be derailed  at least seven of those hedge funds can be tied to michael milken or his close associates we had also learned that milken himself stood to profit if dendreon were to experience problems receiving fda approval this is because milken was the early financier and principal deal maker for proquest investments a fund that along with an affiliate controlled a company called novacea which was one of dendreon’s competitors in the race to produce a new treatment for prostate cancer meanwhile lindsay rosenwald a milken crony who once helped run a mafialinked brokerage called dh blair which specialized in pumping and dumping fake biotech companies controlled cougar biotechnology which was dendreon’s second competitor in the race to develop a new treatment for prostate cancer we had learned further that milken’s “philanthropic” outfit the prostate cancer foundation seems largely to be an extension of milken’s investment fund proquest this might explain why the prostate cancer foundation endorsed and provided financial support to novacea and cougar neither of which had shown that their treatments were safe or effective while snubbing its nose at dendreon in addition we had learned that in april  an fdacontracted physician dr howard scher who was also an executive and director of milken’s proquest investments and the chairman of milken’s prostate cancer foundation “therapeutic consortium” spearheaded an unprecedented lobbying effort to undermine the prescribed regulatory process and convince the fda to deny approval to dendreon — the first time in history that the fda went against an advisory panel’s recommendation to approve a drug destined for dying patients in the days before and after the lobbying effort dendreon was subjected to a blistering attack by naked short sellers who illegally flooded the market with millions of phantom shares to help drive down the company’s stock price this criminal naked short selling continued intermittently for much of the next two years while other events conspired to hobble dendreon a company that had completed multiple clinical trials that strongly suggested that its product provenge was capable of lengthening the lives of tens of thousands of men with prostate cancer…         “black wednesday at the fda” that is how dr mark thornton a former medical officer in the fda’s office of oncology products described the fda’s decision not to approve dendreon’s provenge  in an oped for the wall street journal dr thornton described vaccines such as provenge as the “holy grail of cancer treatment”  without directly referring to anyone by name dr thorton described dr scher’s lobbying effort as “arrogant” and “unprecedented” dr thornton added that when the fda succumbed  to that lobbying “the dawn of a new era in cancer immunotherapy was driven back into the night it will be years before we know the full impact of these decisions and how many cancer patients…have had their lives cut short as a result” this scandal infuriated many other physicians and patient advocates with  the exception of those affiliated with milken’s prostate cancer foundation some dendreon supporters took to the streets on june   there was a protest in front of the american society of clinical oncology two days later several prostate cancer advocacy groups rallied in washington on june  there was yet another protest this one attended by still more physicians who demanded to know why the fda had failed to approve dendreon’s treatment “i’d like to explain in the most basic of terms” said dr mark moyad of the university of michigan medical school at the june  rally “we think a mistake has been made we are here in a friendly way to start the process of correcting that mistake” that word — “friendly” – seems to me to perfectly describe dendreon’s supporters i might add  “intelligent” and “fair” and “engaged”  but the mainstream media played its customary role by portraying such advocates as vexatious wackos notwithstanding the fact that many of dendreon’s supporters were respected physicians “oncologists do not usually need bodyguards…” began a story in the washington post which was all about the dendreon “controversy”  the gist of this story was that people advocating for prostate cancer patients might somehow be dangerous – that it was strange how vocal they were it was strange that they used the internet to get the word out – and dr scher the physician who helped derail dendreon feared for his safety he had even received some “threats” nowhere in the story was it suggested that a great many prominent doctors were saying that the fda had made a “mistake” in failing to approve dendreon’s application nowhere was it mentioned that dr scher played a significant role in engineering this “mistake”  and nowhere was it mentioned that dr scher was egregiously conflicted due to his financial ties to michael milken’s investment fund and dendreon’s competitors novacea and cougar biotechnology essentially identical stories appeared in the philadelphia inquirer the new york times the boston globe the seattle times and on cnbc every one of these media outfits portrayed dendreon’s supporters as potentially dangerous lunatics every one of them stated unequivocally that dr scher had been “threatened”  yet not one of them specifically described the threats and as far as i can ascertain there were no “threats” clearly there was a new party line – dr scher was the victim given the near verbatim repetition of this party line in so many newspapers and given my experience working in the mainstream media i can say with near certainty that this was the work of an orchestrated public relations campaign – a campaign to distract attention from what was really happening to dendreon meanwhile dendreon remained one of the most manipulated stocks on nasdaq on the day that the washington post story appeared sec data showed that criminal naked short sellers had sold and failed to deliver more than  million dendreon shares following the mainstream media’s standard operating procedures no mention was made of this phantom stock in any of the stories on dendreon’s troubles         by june of  dendreon’s stock price was averaging around  – down from its early april high of  there was no way the company could raise more money on the stock market and so it had to significantly scale back its work on neuvenge a promising treatment that fought breast cancer in the same way that provenge fought prostate cancer in order to get enough cash to continue work on provenge dendreon issued over  million worth of convertible bonds sometimes hedge funds that buy a company’s convertible bonds are wellintentioned – they want the company to succeed so that the company can repay the loan but often hedge funds that buy convertible bonds do not have the company’s best interests at heart indeed deep capture has obtained an internal client presentation given by a wellknown investment bank that states that the single largest segment of investors in convertible bonds are hedge funds that actually intend to increase their bets against the companies that they are financing a convertible bond is debt that can be “converted” into stock a hedge fund lends a company say  million as repayment the hedge fund can either receive the  million plus interest at maturity or instead it can receive say  million shares in the company if the share price is  at the time of the loan those  million shares would be worth  million but if the share price rises to  the hedge fund can convert his  million loan into  million worth of stock if the hedge fund manager is a value investor who wishes the company well he will make his loan and wait for the stock to rise but there are various ways that convertible bonds can be put to malevolent use suppose a group of hedge funds have launched a full scale short selling attack against a company but the hedge funds want to short sell even more stock  to do that legally the hedge funds must first locate more stock to borrow and then sell it but sometimes there is simply no more stock available for short sellers to borrow now suppose the share price has already been significantly hammered so the company can no longer raise money through the stock market the hedge funds know this and the hedge funds are important clients of an investment bank so the hedge funds and the investment bank hatch a plan it works like this the investment bank tells the victim company that it can resolve the company’s cash problems by brokering a convertible bond offering if the company agrees the investment bank says “great but there’s just one hitch – you the company have to lend us the investment bank the shares that the company would normally keep on hand in case the bond holders convert to assuage any fears the investment bank might promise the company that it will not relend those shares to short sellers but will merely sell them to long buyers – people who want to invest in the company the company says “fine” and issues say  million worth of debt convertible to  million shares the company also agrees to that “hitch” — so now the investment bank has wangled a “stock loan” agreement that gives it exclusive rights to borrow those  million shares until such time as the bond holders convert meanwhile the investment bank returns to that group of hedge funds who agree to buy the convertible bonds as a means to extricating those  million shares from the company once the investment bank is in possession of those shares it cannot at least according to its agreement with the company lend them to the hedge funds for purposes of short selling but it can do one better it can broker swap contracts that oblige counterparties to pay the hedge funds a certain amount of money in the event that the company’s stock price decreases in value then the investment bank dumps those  million shares into the market all at once causing the stock price to further collapse meanwhile the hedge funds and the investment bank might be engaging in naked short selling – selling stock that has never been borrowed by anybody ie stock that does not exist if anyone asks about this illegal naked short selling the hedge funds say they thought they had “a locate” on stock that they could borrow and deliver if anyone asks the hedge funds to be more specific the hedge funds say that they had “located” and planned to borrow those  million shares that the investment bank had borrowed from the victim company if the sec notes that the investment bank had an agreement not to lend those shares to short sellers the hedge funds say they didn’t know about that of course the sec rarely asks any of these questions but the convertible bonds provide some immunity just in case as the stock price hits rock bottom the company depletes the cash it raised from the bond offering and the only way for the company to receive new funding is to issue more convertible bonds to the hedge funds or do one of those dreaded “death sprial” pipe deals if this were a game of chess it would now be “check” for the hedge funds the company knows that its stock price and its financing depend entirely on the hedge funds which are put in the position of being able to drive and trade ahead of the company’s business decisions this scheme might even allow a set of hedge funds to take control of say a  million company for a  million loan with the exception of the naked short selling most of this scheme’s elements can be found in the standard powerpoint presentations that some banks deliver to their hedge fund clients behind closed doors the investment banks market the scheme as a way to profit from volatility in the stock when the stock crashes the hedge funds make money from the swaps and their short selling if the stock subsequently increases in value the hedge funds can convert their bonds and use some of the proceeds to pay the counterparties to the swaps but sometimes the hedge funds intend to fully destroy the company they make plenty on their short positions and swaps and their bonds pull in some money during the bankruptcy proceedings sometimes during bankruptcy the hedge fund lenders get their hands on company assets such as blockbuster medical treatments that are actually worth considerably more than what they spent on their bonds at other times the ultimate goal is not to destroy the company outright but to crash the stock and then accumulate shares giving the hedge funds still more influence over company decisions and perhaps paving the way for a hostile takeover i do not know for certain the motivations of the hedge funds that bought dendreon’s convertible bonds i do not know if they engaged in naked short selling after all the identities of the naked short sellers and the real amount of failed trades they are generating are as far as the sec is concerned still a big secret remember that the sec says that releasing information about illegal naked short sales would reveal the criminal hedge funds’ “proprietary trading strategies” and the sec cannot have that i do know however that nearly every one of dendreon’s convertible bond holders are connected in important ways to michael milken or the seven affiliated hedge fund managers who held large numbers of put options in dendreon prior to the strange occurrences of march  this raises the suspicion that the convertible bond holders were not typical investors that is investors who put in capital hoping that the company would prosper instead the fact that the buyers of the converts were part of the same network that was placing large bets against dendreon and taking steps with help from milken’s “philanthropy” to derail dendreon’s treatment for prostate cancer raises the possibility that these bond investments were made as part of a strategy to manipulate dendreon’s stock price down  during which time members of this network would with help from milken’s prostate cancer foundation pump up the stock prices of dendreon’s “competitors” – the companies controlled by milken and his friends in the two years that these shenanigans were going on  american men died of prostate cancer which seemed to be of no concern to this particular network of miscreants but once the competing milkenconnected companies had been thoroughly pumped and then dumped on the news that their treatments were worthless it would perhaps be time to exert greater control over the one company–dendreon–that actually had a treatment that could extend lives as we will see members of the milken network – some of the hedge funds that bought the convertible bonds and some of the seven hedge funds that were betting big against dendreon in  – have as a group recently become the company’s largest shareholders their precise intentions however remain a mystery while we do not have photoperfect pictures of what was going on behind the scenes of dendreon’s bizarre trading the sec does not let that get public we do know that this paradoxical play of participating in a convertible bond in order to further a manipulative scheme against a company is in fact a standard play on wall street given this we would be remiss  not to name the colorful hedge funds that bought dendreon’s convertible bonds         as we have covered milken crony carl icahn founded the options department at gruntal  company which owed its existence to michael milken and was one of the more disreputable trading houses on the street ultimately gruntal was found to have employed several traders with ties to the mafia and soon after it was charged with a massive fraud and forced to pay what was then one of the largest fines in wall street history many of gruntal’s former employees ended up working for white rock capital which was run by the alleged russian mobster felix sater the fellow who was allegedly behind the threat to have deep capture reporter patrick byrne murdered if he did not end his crusade against naked short selling and the “deep capture” of important institutions as we also know when icahn left gruntal he handed over direction of the options department to milken crony ron aizer the first trader aizer hired was steve cohen who was reportedly investigated by the sec for trading on inside information provided by milken’s shop and later became “the most powerful trader on wall street” — the fourth of those seven hedge fund managers prescient enough to bet big against dendreon before milken’s other cronies derailed the company in  the second trader hired by aizer was a man named andrew redleaf who later went on to cofound two hedge funds — deephaven capital management and whitebox advisors  according to a media account posted on whitebox’s website redleaf’s family kept its investment accounts at drexel burnham lambert where michael milken was then running his stock manipulation and junk bond empire redleaf was recommended to aizer by andy stillman who was then managing drexel’s propriety options trading in later years redleaf became wellknown for investing in sun country airlines in partnership with tom petters who was recently arrested at gunpoint amid allegations that he had orchestrated a massive ponzi fraud in cahoots with a fellow named michael catain catain’s father jack catain was a genovese mafia enforcer and loan shark who had been involved along with michael milken in zzzz best a fraudulent carpet cleaning company run by barry minkow minkow was eventually imprisoned for the zzzz best fraud and when he was released he began a career as a selfdescribed “fraud investigator” he works in partnership with sam antar the convicted felon who masterminded a massive fraud in the s at an appliance retailer called crazy eddie antar who is close to milken and his network members of which once tried to help antar seize control of crazy eddie now spends most of his time on the internet smearing and threatening people who work to expose the crime of naked short selling for example antar once posted on the internet the names and address of deep capture reporter judd bagley’s young children antar writes with almost daily regularity that deep capture reporter patrick byrne is running a fraudulent company overstockcom though he has produced nothing to support his claims and every reputable person who has examined his arguments has concluded that they are absurd meanwhile antar has littered the internet with all manner of falsehoods about me—stating for example that i’m a drug addict and was fired from my last job ever the charmer antar has also let it be known that he is friendly with violent people including those who once ambushed me punched me in the face and suggested that i should stop working with patrick byrne it is interesting to note that these facts notwithstanding in  fortune magazine saw fit to grace its pages with a highly flattering  word profile of antar “it takes one to know one” fortune did this even as it acknowledged that “as wouldbe fraudbuster sam e antar has yet to notch his first kill although in fairness he doesn’t hold himself out to be a fulltime q detective ‘i don’t have  people working for me like the sec’ he says he hasn’t brought any companies down or caused any regulators to open any investigations” that is concerning a notorious swindler and convicted felon who threatens little girls smears other journalists is denounced by public officials and who has not actually been the source of any credible investigation that fortune can cite fortune published a perfectly complimentary puff piece as for the abovementioned andrew redleaf i noted that he is a founding partner in deephaven capital management in  deephaven was sanctioned by the sec for short selling  public companies almost all biotech firms on inside information that his hedge fund colleagues were giving the companies “death spiral” pipes finance as you will recall similar schemes have involved milken crony carl icahn the founder of gruntal’s options department jeffrey thorp son of the mafialinked card counter who was the most important figure in milken’s stock manipulation network during the s milken crony lindsay rosenwald who used to run the mafialinked dh blair the president of which was milken’s former national sales manager and gryphon partners which was tied to the mafialinked ninefingered anthony elgindy a naked short seller who is now serving an  year sentence for stock manipulation schemes and bribing two fbi agents my apologies for the repetition but there are some who are new to this and it is difficult for even the well initiated to keep track of so many miscreants so permit me to remind the reader that gryphon’s founder and lindsay rosenwald were among the seven colorful hedge fund managers who bet big against dendreon in march  just before the company was derailed by strange occurences engineered by milken’s cronies also among those seven hedge fund managers was steve cohen who was earlier in his career investigated for trading on inside information provided by milken’s shop and was the first trader hired at gruntal by milkencrony ron aizer andrew redleaf the second trader hired by aizer at gruntal is remember not just a cofounder of deephaven capital sanctioned for short selling on inside information that companies were to receive dubious financing but also the proprietor of whitebox advisors and whitebox advisors is among those hedge funds that bought convertible bonds issued by dendreon a company that suffered a twoyear sustained naked short selling attack while trying to bring to market a treatment for dying cancer patients         a hedge fund called dkr management also bought convertible bonds issued by dendreon dkr was founded by barry l klein and gary s davis previously klein worked for michael milken as the president of drexel burnham lambert trading davis also worked for milken at drexel in later years klein and davis founded the predecessor to aig trading group a unit of american international group aig trading group was later run by joseph cassano who had also been a milken employee at drexel while at aig cassano sold tens of billions of dollars worth of credit default swaps contracts that pay out if a company defaults on its debt to hedge funds and investment banks rolling stone magazine’s matthew taibbi who is one of the mainstream media’s finest journalists was among the first to establish that aig trading group and milken crony cassano destroyed aig which ultimately had to be nationalized by the us government – greatly contributing to the collapse of the financial system last fall since then several reports have also implicated cassano’s milkentied predecessors klein and davis meanwhile various government investigations are seeking to know whether short sellers acquired and manipulated the prices of aig’s credit default swaps as a way to weaken their target companies – including lehman brothers and bear stearns  the question that remains unanswered is whether the short sellers that bought credit default swaps from milken cronies cassano klein and davis were also members of the milken network which would mean that some members of the milken network wrecked the world while the other members of the network bet that they would another highly significant factor in the collapse of the financial system – as can be discerned from statements by countless officials and by reports in virtually every newspaper in the land though the newspapers seem content not to investigate the matter or state this explicitly – was the naked short selling of aig bear stearns lehman brothers fannie mae freddie mac and hundreds of other companies in the years leading up to the financial cataclysm and during the time when dendreon was under attack by naked short sellers certain hedge funds orchestrated an effective public relations campaign aimed at covering up the crime of naked short selling as part of this public relations campaign the hedge funds would regularly trot out a certain yale professor who would do his utmost to defend the criminals this professor’s favorite stratagem was to divert discussion away from illegal naked short selling and repeat over and over that legal short selling was good for the markets–a fact that was never in dispute the professor’s capacity for obfuscation was unmatched but he nonetheless became a favorite source for some members of the media he appeared regularly on cnbc and was quoted in dozens upon dozens of articles – all of which communicated the non sequitor that illegal naked short selling is not bad for the markets because legal short selling is good for the markets of course this is like arguing that sexual harassment is not bad because sex is good the name of this professor is owen lamont to this day the professor is still sought out by the press which dutifully regurgitates his baloney but the professor does not work for yale anymore now he works for the abovementioned dkr management one of the milkenconnected hedge funds that bought dendreon’s convertible bonds while dendreon was brutally attacked by criminal naked short sellers         there are interesting stories to be told about most every hedge fund that bought dendreon’s convertible bonds one of them eagle rock capital run by an iranian fellow named nadir tavakoli was once a controlling investor in the international fight league a promoter of ultimate fighting matches the other controlling investor in the international fight league which went bankrupt amidst allegations of ultimate fighting’s connections to the japanese yakuza and stories that fighters were committing suicides and murders at alarming rates was a “russian whiz kid” according to the media named dmitry balyasny the first things to know about dmitry balyasny are that he is closely affiliated with steve cohen and he is the seventh of those seven hedge fund managers who were betting big against dendreon by holding put options on the company’s stock after the fda advisory panel had recommended that provenge be approved and before milken’s cronies successfully lobbied the fda to ignore that recommendation so i will return to balyasny soon but first let’s continue with our list of hedge funds that held dendreon’s convertible bonds one was glg partners as we know from emails acquired in a lawsuit glg partners received updates on steve cohen’s attack on canadian insurer fairfax financial so it would be unsurprising if glg was also clued in to cohen’s attack on dendreon recall also that shortly before glg bought dendreon’s convertible bonds french authorities fined glg  for being part of an insider trading ring that included ubs o’conner a unit of ubs investment bank which until march  was led by former milken employee ken moelis and meditor capital a hedge fund also of course with ties to steve cohen that had just made a large investment in novacea the prostate cancer company that was then being promoted by milken’s fund and milken’s “philanthropy” as a competitor to dendreon in short glg was “in the mix” another outfit that bought lots of dendreon’s convertible bonds shortly after it was caught running an insider trading ring with meditor and glg partners was…ubs o’conner then there was quattro partners which bought dendreon bonds convertible into a more than a million dendreon shares the founding partner of quattro is named michael baldock he had a long career in biotech investing after spending time as an investment banker at michael milken’s drexel burnham lambert         another of the big investors  in dendreon’s convertible bonds was forest investment management a hedge fund controlled by a man named michael boyd prior to founding forest boyd was a partner in an outfit called forum capital markets boyd’s cofounder in forum was c keith hartley yet another of milken’s disciples from drexel burnham lambert boyd was also the cofounder of a brokerage called mcmahan securities one of his partners in that operation was santo maggio who later became chief executive officer of refco securities the brokerage that was allegedly processing the phantom stock sales of rhino advisors which illegally naked shorted companies after providing them with finance brokered by milken crony carl icahn’s ladenburg thalmann when refco was found to be fraudulently hiding  million worth of liabilities liabilities that many believe were related to naked short selling maggio pled guilty to two counts of securities fraud one count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud another of michael boyd’s many accomplishments is his son roddy refco employed roddy as a trader perhaps as a favor to his father’s former partner the criminal santo maggio but roddy soon abandoned the securities business to become a business journalist – first at the new york post and now at fortune magazine roddy boyd is a key figure among the small coterie of journalists who turn up repeatedly in deep capture‘s analyses like all members of the coterie roddy has spent several years trying to cover up the naked short selling scandal ridiculing anyone who mentions the crime or the remarkable coincidence of companies appearing on the reg sho list the sec’s list of companies suffering from naked short selling when those companies are the targets of a select group of hedge funds whose names will be familiar to the reader who has made it this far in addition to covering up naked short selling crimes roddy writes hatchet jobs on the public companies targeted by this same select group of short selling hedge funds the sources of the information in roddy’s stories are of course the short sellers themselves and most of the short sellers are as has been explained over and over tied to michael milken or his close associates for example roddy spent a great deal of time working with a soontobe arrested criminal named spyro contogouris who had been hired by a subsidiary of steve cohen’s sac capital to sabotage harass and trash fairfax financial as mentioned we have obtained a great number of emails between cohen jim chanos of kynikos associates and others in the network that was attacking fairfax in one email hedge fund manager chanos writes to journalist roddy boyd “your courtesy was a boon to me thank you” with the exception of roddy’s particular clique of journalists it is not typical for reporters to receive thank you notes for the “courtesies” that they have extended to help hedge funds make money another holder of dendreon’s convertible bonds was cnh partners run by todd pulvino who used to work for grosvenor capital grosvenor is managed by scott lederman who was the grad school roommate of steve cohen and later the chief operating officer of cohen’s sac capital while pulvino was presenting himself as a legitimate investor in dendreon’s debt was he in touch with steve cohen who had bet big against dendreon right before provenge was derailed by the unprecedented lobbying effort of milken’s other cronies we can’t say and we can’t say who was illegally naked short selling dendreon’s stock that remember is a big secret – “proprietary trading strategies”         on october   dendreon still desperate for capital to continue clinical trials that might eventually help its cancer treatment receive fda approval signed the paperwork on its first pipe deal a dreaded pipe – the sort of deal that dilutes equity and tends to attract naked short selling that sends a company’s stock into a “death spiral” the provider of this pipe finance was the azimuth opportunity fund managed by an outfit called acqua wellington asset management acqua wellington is controlled by a “prominent” investor named isser elishis in an otherwise flattering article herb greenberg – a journalist whose entire career was devoted to granting “courtesies” to hedge funds in the milken network – described elishis as the “banker of last resort” herb who disappeared from public sight after he was exposed by deep capture  now owns a company that ostensibly sells financial research to hedge funds in the milken network or arguably merely receives payment from them for the extensive string of “courtesies” that herb extended while working as a journalist among azimuth’s first forays into the markets was an investment in a company called sulphco which claimed to have a method for turning sulphrous crude into cleanburning oil elishis collaborated on this deal with sulphco’s principal investor zev wolfson who you will recall was the investor who financed milken cronies carl icahn saul steinberg john mulheren and various brokerages tied to the mafia naked short selling or both sec data shows that on the day that dendreon signed its pipe deal with azimuth naked short sellers flooded the market with more than  million phantom shares during the following week more than a million dendreon shares “failed to deliver” every day despite or perhaps because of the news that dendreon had enrolled  patients in a trial to confirm its earlier positive results putting provenge back on the track to fda approval         in the late s a fellow named jeffrey yass and his two friends eric brooks and kenneth brodie set up a partnership to place bets at horse racing tracks across the country on one single day at sportsman park in chicago they pulled in winnings of more than  this seemed somewhat excessive so sportsman park banned the three friends from its premises the punters filed a lawsuit claiming that sportsman park had violated their rights to visit a public facility at any rate jeffrey yass and eric brooks eventually abandoned the business of betting on horse races and instead pursued careers on wall street now they are “prominent” investors the proprietors of a midsized investment and trading house called susquehanna international in the spring of  susquehanna was introduced to dendreon by a placement agent lazard capital markets it is not clear why dendreon would want to do business with lazard after all lazard was home to the singing joel sendek who had been busily trashing dendreon in his research reports sendek had also been trumpeting dendreon’s competitor cougar biotechnology as the next big thing in cancer treatment in turn cougar biotechnology the company then controlled by milken crony lindsay rosenwald formerly of the mafiaaffiliated pumpanddump shop dh blair had been quoting sendek in its sec filings sendek’s endorsement cougar seemed to be suggesting was evidence that the company was making progress toward bringing its prostate cancer treatment to market this was odd because most pharmaceutical companies use data collected from clinical trials to demonstrate this not quotes from singing wall street analysts meanwhile it was widely understood that lazard’s stock loan department was one of the goto shops for hedge funds looking to short sell dendreon’s shares we cannot say that lazard was loaning phantom stock to the short sellers if it were that would be a big secret but lazard’s coziness with short sellers ought to have given dendreon pause there was also the fact that lazard capital had only recently been spun off from lazard ltd given that the two operations remained closely affiliated sharing business and so forth it might have been of some concern that the chairman of lazard ltd was bruce wasserstein a close associate of michael milken in “den of thieves” james stewart the pulitzer prize winning author quotes a criminal named denis levine as saying that wasserstein was “owned” by milken’s famous coconspirator ivan boesky given that denis levine was indicted for participating in boesky’s insider trading schemes one would think he knew of what he spoke but there is no hard evidence to support his allegation in any case dendreon followed lazard’s advice and did a “registered direct offering” with capital ventures international an affiliate of susquehanna the firm founded by yass and brooks a “registered direct offering” is similar to a pipe the difference being that the securities sold to the investor are registered with the sec and immediately tradable for most of march  naked short sellers were failing to deliver less than  shares per day as negotiations for the “registered direct offering” were underway the amount of phantom stock gradually increased and on the day the deal was signed april  at least  million phantom shares had been sold into the market and remained undelivered for the next two months more than one million dendreon shares remained “failed to deliver” every day this despite or perhaps because of the fantastic news on march   that the fda had agreed to an amended “special protocol assessment” which would enable the company to release one year ahead of schedule the results of an “impact” trial that seemed likely to confirm the company’s phase  trials showing substantial evidence that provenge was safe and effective as dendreon’s enemies must have known it would soon be impossible to stymie the company with arguments about data but stock manipulators were not yet ready to end their campaign against the company         to be continued…click here for chapter  if this article concerns you
