trigger it looks like goldmans troubles are getting in the way of the planned retirement of cfo david viniar  seen here before testifying to congress in april ap goldman sachs’ superstar cfo david viniar has been quietly considering making an exit from the firm where he’s spent his entire career sources tell the post viniar a threedecade goldman veteran considered one of the brightest financial minds on wall street told a handful of close associates as recently as last year about his desire to retire — but then quickly put those plans on the back burner when wall street’s most profitable firm ran into turbulence the roughgoing includes a civil fraud suit filed by the securities and exchange commission over marketing of mortgagerelated securities a federal criminal probe on the same matter and a civil suit brought by a hedge fund that bought a goldman cdo at the same time goldman’s oncevaunted reputation is being pilloried in public a goldman spokesman said that viniar “has no plans to retire anytime soon” still sources familiar with the matter say viniar’s earlier plan would have had him stepping down to pursue other interests as early as this year but those plans changed as it could be seen by the outside world that one of the firm’s top officers was abandoning ship “david is very much a team player and he’ll do whatever the firm asks of him” said one source added a second source “he’s so loyal he’s only going to do anything when the timing is appropriate” among partners and clients of the firm the bronxborn viniar who turns  years old next month is considered a rock star lauded as much for his ease at explaining complex transactions as for his unpretentious disarming manner viniar joined the firm back in  as an investment banker after graduating from harvard business school and has been the lead finance officer at the firm since  — just before the closely held private partnership launched a public offering of stock on the union college basketball team the lanky footinch viniar dubbed “bones” was a benchwarmer but within the halls of goldman viniar is viewed as one of the most valuable players credited with pushing the firm to take short bets against housing as the mortgage market was upending its rivals “under viniar the cfo job became a whole lot bigger said one former goldman source “he is a critical thinker who helped determine things like how much capital the firm set aside for certain lines of business” in fact one source said viniar’s various duties may be taken over by multiple goldman staffers when he decides to step down goldman slid

  am modal trigger goldman cfo david viniar put a simple spin on a murky episode in the financial crisis how the firm managed to be paid in full by collapsing aig ap it was designed to be a scolding of goldman sachs’ brass in search of assigning blame for the mortgage crisis — but it ended up revealing how little congress understands about the goldplated firm’s business some of goldman’s best and brightest minds yesterday faced a withering verbal assault from lawmakers who often betrayed their lack of understanding of goldman’s role in many of the transactions now drawing fire at one point michigan sen carl levin chairman of the senate subcommittee on permanent investigations accused goldman of being “rife with conflicts of interest” and declared the firm wasn’t worthy of trust many of the issues that were sticking points for members of the panel appeared to be rooted in different interpretations of goldman’s role as a socalled “market maker” or an entity that links buyers and sellers foulmouth senate curses out goldman twotiming top trader’s ‘fabulous’ defiance crudele former trader sounds off on the firm traders smelt blood in gs hearing while the senators repeatedly argued that goldman created securities solely for the purpose of betting against them goldman ceo lloyd blankfein and others fended off those charges by trying to explain that investors all of whom are savvy enough to understand the bank’s role weren’t interested in whether goldman was betting for or against a security it created “you keep using the word betting ‘against” blankfein exclaimed at one point to levin “we are principals” “the nature of the principal business and market making is that we are the other side of what our client wants to do” he said “and in the context of market making that is not a conflict i don’t think our clients care or should care if goldman is taking a short position” he added “i don’t view it as a conflict of interest” cfo david viniar told sen ted kaufman in explaining goldman’s dual role earlier in the day several members of the subcommittee tussled with former mortgagetrading desk boss dan sparks who argued goldman was under no obligation to disclose its position with a security it was selling because that position might change day to day “should you have told that client you were going short if you were” levin demanded of sparks “currently that is not an obligation” sparks said “i think it would create a number of issues because those positions change a lot and you don’t know what those positions are at any given moment” but the misunderstandings didn’t stop there at one point a number of senators declared that goldman had a fiduciary responsibility to be completely transparent about its activities with each security even though that responsibility doesn’t exist with market makers in another instance some lawmakers attempted to equate a futures contract to speculate on the price of corn with a structuredmortgage product like a collateralized debt obligation “it’s complicated” goldman ceo lloyd blankfein said at one point during his testimony “well a lot of these things are fairly complicated mr blankfein” sen john mccain fired back that exchange typified the more than nearly  hours of testimony that started out with current and former members of goldman’s mortgagetrading desk and wrapped up with blankfein among the highlights was testimony from fabrice tourre a goldman exec who was named in a civil fraud suit against goldman by the securities and exchange commission which has accused the bank of misleading investors about the involvement of billionaire hedge funder john paulson in a cdo called abacus on saturday goldman released a series emails from tourre’s work account the messages spoke about his take on the collateralized debt obligation cdo market that it is “a little like frankenstein turning against his own inventor” in earlier testimony yesterday tourre told the senate subcommittee that the emails “reflect badly on the firm and on myself and i wish i hadn’t sent these” markdecambrenypostcom share thisfacebooktwittergooglefacebook messengerwhatsappemailcopy share

httprdffreebasecomnsmeasurementunitdatedpercentage  if youre writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
