new page november  the business brotherhood of don and reg newman by maria scrivani family is a priority for reg and don newmanand not just because the brothers are in business together in fact noco energy corp founded by their father six decades ago owes its genesis to a growing familys needs in order to provide for his wife and son the newborn donald reginald b newman left a job that paid too little to start his own business a bill of sale dated july   tells part of the tale reg newman senior borrowed several hundred dollars to purchase a coaldelivery truck the invoice mentions the state trust company a predecessor of marine midland now hsbcstill banker to the newman enterprise reg senior calling his business the rb newman fuel company started delivering coal doortodoor in the city of tonawanda in  when more homes were being converted from coal to heating oil he added the latter product to his inventory by then reginald b newman ii had been born the second son in what was destined to be a family of successful business owners reg newman sr  rb newmans first fuel oil truck  our dad drove the truck himselfhe had maybe four or five employees don the family historian relates heating oil cost eight to ten cents a gallon as boys he and brother reg hung around their dads business then located on niagara street in the city of tonawanda they both worked there after school reg admitting i didnt love it but don was fully engaged i learned to fix furnaces and trucks he recalls by the time don graduated from high school in  the company had branched out selling gasoline and lubricants to small businesses the company began a relationship with mobil that continues to this day don armed with an engineering degree from carnegie mellon university went to work full time at noco in  pausing just once for a twoyear military stint in the mids dad still put me to work whenever i was home on leave he says while in the service don met the colonels daughter barbara lutz who became his wife in  during this time brother reg was studying business administration at northwestern university dreaming of a future that might not include noco i wanted to be in a company with some size he recalls after graduating he went to work for the ford motor company in dearborn michigan for a year in  two momentous events occurred reg married carol eggerss and he brought her back to western new york where he rejoined the family business this time he found his niche becoming in the words of don the ultimate salesman a oneman sales team for noco don was still doing the dirty work fixing furnaces and delivering fuel both brothers were happy and business blossomed in the booming s noco was acquiring smaller distribution companies and selling fuel to commercial fleet customers as well as heating oil to steel companies and manufacturing companies it meant a lot of long hours and hard work for us all don says reg and don newman  reginald b newman ii sister kathryn newman feld and donald f newman reginald b newman sr and ethel newman  tom newman  telecommunications field and nocos future mike newman  manager of dealer relations and real estate jim newman  executive vice president and bob newman  president of noco express a subsidiary  early on the newmans owned a retail gas station in the city of tonawanda where they also sold tires and repaired cars at night the brothers took turns manning the gas pumps this was the forerunner to the companys current chain of  retail gasoline shops in a recent interview for a business journal don noted we have continually diversified and expanded but unlike so many others in our business we have done it by staying within the petroleum industry in  noco acquired a terminal on grand island boulevard from the gulf oil corporation putting them in the liquid warehouse business in the mids don notes we went fullbore into the distribution of lubricants it was in  that the company name was officially changed to noco energy corp which is now western new yorks largest independent supplier of energy and petroleum products noco operates throughout new york state several years ago a joint venture in toronto resulted in the establishment of noco canada an affiliate of noco energy      reginald newman senior lived long enough to see the fantastic fruits of his labor he died in  having earlier signed over the business to his able boys in anticipation of the companys growth a daughter kathryn who now lives in north carolina was provided for with a trust fund in  their beloved mother died dad and mom taught us the importance of family values don says our dad believed in supporting the community for years he was involved with the old community chest precursor to the united way the boys club etc reg and i have continued that traditionnow we have many friends in common we have not had to deal with personal jealousies since their partnership was in essence made in heaven their relationship is marked by an easy camaraderie despite their success noted in the national arena when noco was featured in a pbs series on family businesses the newmans remain modest in the big picture of big oil companies they note noco is a small fry as far as i can see reg says casting a fond glance at his big brother his hat size is the same as it was  years ago and mine absolutely is their children and now grandchildren are equally wellgrounded regs two live out of town wendy mother of three is a former advertising sales rep son clark is a private pilot for rich products don has four boys tom works in telecommunications the other three are scions of what has become the noco dynasty bob is responsible for the noco express retail operations mike oversees the companys real estate portfolio and dealer relations and jim executive vice president and chief operating officer is being groomed by uncle reg to take over the reins one day don taking a page from his fathers book officially retired at age  although an owner never really retires hes still around to advise to serve on a boatload of boards ranging from the american automobile club of western and central new york to the western new york public broadcasting association and as president of such organizations as the country club of buffalo and the buffalo club our dad was a good cheerleader for us when we took over the business he says thats what i hope to do now reg has plans to step down in a few years when he reaches the magic age of  he too has spent much time in committee meetings and board sessions for many organizations charitable educational social etc he recently chaired the buffalo niagara partnership the benefits run on a twoway street he says with typical candor since we were kids weve spent a lot of time doing things in the community both personally and in a corporate wayin return people are pleased to do business with us now that the boys are in great demand to serve on various boards he sees part of his mission as guiding their community involvements and passing down some of the work for groups traditionally supported by the newmans though both have vacation homes in florida don and reg are solid western new yorkers if i had to choose one place theres no question itd be here says don all of our friends are here as far as business goes the roots are firmly attached despite the lure of lesstaxing states the bureaucracy regulatory and tax situation in new york state is very antibusiness reg says despite what he sees as a discouraging political situation he insists we love buffalo we love its friendliness and believe it or not the climate after  years in business now with  employees and a third generation of newmans set to run the company

company profile noco energy corporation company profile noco energy corporation noco energy corporation is celebrating the type of milestone this year that most companies only dream of’ years in business the story is typically american with an entrepreneur seeing an opportunity and taking the risks to turn that opportunity into a successful enterprise two subsequent generations in this familyowned company each built upon the success of the previous to take the operation to new levels of success multigenerational familyowned companies are not all that unusual in this industry nor is successful entrepreneurship what might be unusual in many cases is how smoothly the process has run not only with the transitions of leadership but with a dramatic expansion and diversification of the company’s operations noco today distributes a full portfolio of energy products including residential and commercial fuels natural gas electricity and lubricants in addition noco operates  noco express retail convenience stores and supplies branded and unbranded gasoline to a growing dealer network noco employs over  employees across new york state vermont pennsylvania as well as ontario and operates a fleet of over  vehicles the company was founded in tonawanda new york in  by reginald b newman donald f newman reginald’s son describes how he played a key role in the operation being founded “my mom and dad were married in  during the depression” he said “my dad was called in to the office where he worked and was told that since his wife also worked and he and my mother were living with his inlaws he was getting a pay cut now i was born about nine months and  minutes later during march of  he went back in and said ‘my wife can’t work anymore and i would like to be able to get a home for my new family’ his boss said that was too bad and my dad quit on the spot he went out and borrowed a couple of hundred dollars from my maternal grandmother and went to the bank and borrowed a few hundred more dollars and bought his first coal truck in july of  and he went doortodoor peddling coal” the move to fuel oil began in  when the company purchased its first  gallon tank truck the first oil deliveries were made using a spigot on the back of the truck with the driver filling a couple of  gallon cans filling the tanks through a funnel “when they had the first hose reel they would pull that out but had to reel it in with a big crank” said don “i remember as a kid and when we got the first electric hose reel everybody died and went to heaven but the only problem was that it ran the battery down too fast” the company offered “full oil service” that included getting the tank in the basement and installing maintaining and servicing the heating appliances as a young man don went out with his father while the process was under way of ripping out the old coal grates and putting in oil tanks and oil burners “when i was a young teenager i learned how to fix oil burners” don said “i remember dad would come home after a couple of cocktails and he would make me go down in the basement and take the oil burner apart and put it back together when i was a kid i used to pull hose and fill up oil tanks the ticket was easy to calculate back then because oil cost  per gallon” in  reginald newman expanded the company’s focus to begin servicing commercial and industrial customers with lubricants gasoline and diesel fuel reginald’s two sons don and reginald b newman ii joined the company in  and  respectively they continued the family tradition of growth by broadening noco’s product lines and marketing area the next move from traditional residential oil heating came during the s with a move into commercial and industrial no  oil that was distributed to churches and hospitals and schools it was at this point that the company began buying its first large tractortrailer vehicles in  noco expanded its operations to include service stations typical for the time these were twobay stations with one or two fullservice fueling islands there was a gradual expansion during the next  years with a number of sites peaking at near  stores   the second generation takes over in  don and his brother reginald assumed control of the company “my dad decided’when my brother and myself were coming along’that when you are in a family business and the heirs are capable of running it you get the heck out of the way when you turn ” said don “he did that for us and i elected to do that for my two boys jim and mike i felt you can’t have a business where pop and uncle go to florida for half a year and then want to slip back into the seat and take over again it doesn’t work” this period marks notable expansion both in the scale and breadth of its operations at the height of the oil crisis in  reginald and donald had the opportunity to take advantage of an industrial development bond and buy the million gallon gulf oil terminal in buffalo ny in  noco home heat was formed with the acquisition of ashland oil’s home heat business and akron oil corp which was expanded in  with the purchase of a million gallon storage facility from ashland oil that was adjacent to its existing terminal operations it was during this period in  that the company changed its name to noco energy corp it also through a longrunning relationship with mobil became involved with bulk lubricants sales and has grown its footprint to not only include the northeast and canada but as far inland as ohio and kentucky geographical expansion was also in the works in  reginald worked to develop a business relationship with a former petro canada executive jeremy hinchcliffe to create noco canada that involved both fuel distribution and lubricants in  noco opened its first convenience store in what was the growing trend at the time of converting service stations into small convenience operations “i opened the first convenience store with what we describe up in this market as a miniserv” said don newman “we took old twobays gas stations closed the bays down and had kids there to pump the gas with a very competitive pricing system of course that is totally obsolete today but it helped launch our convenience store business which jim and mike have taken to a completely new level particularly with what they have done in the past few years” as with many companies moving in the convenience from a fuel focus the early efforts post some difficulty “to be honest we struggled a great deal with the transition” said don newman “we were very petroleum oriented not that we weren’t successful but i did bring some people in to help us with the merchandising and vendor relationships”   generation now don’s children mike and jim newman began working in the business as kids one of their first jobs was to cut the grass at one of the early noco gas stations mike came back professionally during  and jim around  in  jim and mike were named president and executive vice president respectively carrying the business into the third generation under their leadership the company has not only finetuned its existing operations but continued the process of expansion as a true energy company jim took the lead on expanding the company’s home heating business to include marketing propane to commercial and residential customers these operations have been greatly expanded during the previous decade and in  noco began marketing natural gas to commercial and industrial customers this operation was expanded in  to include residential customers and to also include an electricity sales program natural gas is a fierce competitor to the heating oil industry but it also offers an opportunity “we are an energy company’we’re just a distributor” said mike neumann “we try to be agnostic as to what we distribute as long as there are parallels around the same types of customers we are working with we can go to the same customer with multiple of products one reason natural gas works well for us is that many of our potential customers might have been our heating oil customer  years ago we can go back to them and try to be their partner in natural gas and electric and that provides us another opportunity to comb through database that we already have and sell them again or if they are going to transition to natural gas we would like to be their provider for that as well” the company also began to rationalize its convenience store operations downsizing the number by approximately half but increasing the quality of each location retained to maximize profitability in  it completed its first major retail station rebuild and incorporates two quickserve restaurants charlie the butcher and tim hortons at the express store its canadian operations were also adjusted during the last ownership transition with noco maintaining its lubricant operations but divesting its motor fuels operations in a not entirely uncommon offshoot for companies involved in convenience store operations noco has a real estate development division noco energy also has a business where it collects and recycles used motor oil back at its terminal for reuse as a heating product the company also operates a soil recycling facility near its terminal where it processes gasoline contaminated soil   managing diversification while diversification provides a powerful source of revenue stability in the volatile energy market one challenge for any company as diversified as noco is managing the different operations in an effective and efficient manner “the biggest challenge when you begin to do that is to understand how to allocate capital properly” said mike “you cannot fall in love with a particular business and you have to be able to measure them across and against each other using riskadjusted measures” in order to conduct that valuation the proper benchmarking metrics need to be established “for the stores we are really involved in the csxnacs data collection and we aggressively benchmark our operations against industry leaders we use industry data elsewhere in our business to see if we are staying on track but one of the challenges we have come across since we’re in the business is how do you measure current asset utilization a lot of assets have already been written off so do you throw a market value on there and look at the utility of market so you’re not missing out on opportunity costs and how do you allocate capital around that so we try to walk through and evaluate the risks that each business brings” another issue newman cited is avoiding popularity contests where you invest in things you like more than you invest in operations that are providing higher returns diversification holds with it the promise of integrating a range of administrative functions on the back end to support the varied front end operations while there is considerable opportunity in areas such as accounting mike newman notes that those efficiencies diminish as you get closer to the specialized operational and system needs of the independent business units “we can aggregate data very well and measure it you have to be careful not to try to do too much onesizefitsall for systems development” he said “there are some really specialized systems that are really well done and even though we would like to have one overall kind of enterprise software there are limitations you can do that somewhat on the lubricant side’we’re trying to put that in place on the fuel side’but it gets more difficult when you get out into the dealer business for example” while noco has taken diversification to a top level some degree of diversification should be on the mind of any fuel oil or motor fuels market “i think diversification is critical” said mike “obviously in the energy business there is a lot of natural market correlation but we try to be able to look at as a continuum of risk we have some things that are probably on the more risky side and some that are far less risky and we try to make sure we balance ourselves across a number of them so we try to put ourselves in the position that if any one thing happens it would kill us but with that sometimes i get concerned that without more specialization  digital leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name
