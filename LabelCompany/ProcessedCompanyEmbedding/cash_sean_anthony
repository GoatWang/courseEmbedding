review… brian orndorfbrianorndorfcom view all critic reviews  audience reviews for cah no one can be trusted when it comes to good entertaining movie cah isnt a thriller in academic film terms its not a traditional action film either if the film must have a label it is neo noir satire noir features a desperate protagonist who is an antihero cah is an entertaining movie where everybody is corrupt in the end even those that have been robbed and declare a larger amount to benefit with the insurance sean bean performs a peculiar but very dangerous criminal with a great knowledge of economics chris hemsworth is the typical american low middle class with a great alienation and lack of general culture the screenplay is enjoyable and the resolution of the situation is satisfactory a stroke of good luck turns lethal for sam phelan and his wife leslie when they are faced with a lifechanging decision that brings strange and sinister pyke kubic to their doorstep as pyke leads sam and leslie on a tumultuous adventure through the streets of chicago each are pulled deeper and deeper into a desperate spiral of deception and violence all in the name of money manu gino super reviewer nothing special or even particularly good here but its watchable the dialogue was really bad however the actress was also not so good chris hemsworth is probably the only decent thing about this silly little movie cynthia s super reviewer ½ corny and predictable yet annoyingly enjoyable would have loved to see a tweist at the end of this film but the plot is very straight forward in an easy watching way whilst i often have a problem with english accents in american all sounding the same sean bean uses his own sheffield accent in this film and i guess i would have to put it to not brits to say whether that works or not the double role for bean was also a little cheesy hasnt this been done too many times as early as the norman wisdom days lady darbanville super reviewer oh this is bad what a waste sean bean is on auto pilot in this dialogue and acting is terrible little or close to no real action must have been a low budget tv film just skip it and save that mins for something else dean king

and we are on episode number  and holy cow i got an amazing interview for you from a guy name anthony price out of st louis and he drops one of the most ninja bombs that i have ever heard of doing this for close to  to  years on how to build a buyers list almost overnight it’s amazing all right sean terry here back with another awesome interview with the man out of st louis killing it anthony price what is up anthony anthony   hey what’s going on everybody sean    so you’re online with thousands of people listening to you right now and i love to have these… anthony   don’t say that sean    well i would love to have these stories because it truly inspires because a lot of people they might hear from me or like we’re just talking about joe mccall or some of these other people on the podcast and they go “that’s them but what about the guy that had a job a couple of years ago and got started and had some struggles and how are they doing” so this you’re like the perfect example from i know in a competitive market but then it’s just killing it so how you’re doing anthony   doing great sean the new year and everything rock and rolling and the marketing now this and that getting my system building my streamline than what they were last year just tweaking things i have been doing it for a couple of years now so now i am in a mode of getting more marketing out there getting more leads coming and just tweaking everything like crazy just streamline and make a little bit easier sean    cool cool all right so let’s talk about the results i want to start doing this now in our podcast we talk about specific results then we can dive into those results and so people can take actionable things from the podcast so they can apply that helps you succeed so the results are revenue what did you do for revenue in  anthony   yeah so i finished year out  that year sean    okay so  in  which is killer now let’s go back in what did you make in  if you remember anthony   oh man  i think sean    so you increased your revenue by  in  wholesaling is this your fulltime gig or do you have another job or this is it anthony   no this is it it’s all or nothing now sean    boom okay so now if you look back in  right what are like two or three the major shifts that you made in  to increase your income  in that year so if you look back at where you were let’s say a year ago and if you could try to pinpoint two or three different things you did in  that have increased your revenue what would you say those be anthony   so when i very first got started i made  just doing cowholesales so in  i actually started doing my own marketing so i was doing direct mail i was doing bandit signs a little bit of google ad words here and there yeah i would just say mostly it’s just constantly and consistently just doing direct mail and getting that out there i mean different with not just one but multiple ways and different types of mailings sean    okay so in  you did  grand without marketing is that what you are saying anthony   right yeah i did all with just wholesaling i was always really good at selling properties i had a big buyers list already so i had already had buyers so when i asked them to cowholesale in a known market and if they need help and luckily they did and made  grand just helping them with all their deals and it was really easy sean    wow okay so for people that doesn’t know what co wholesaling is what is cowholesaling anthony   so you talk to a wholesaler they already have the property under contract and then you just find the buyer for that property and you just split the commission you split the final p or the double closing you just put it  and that’s it you bring them buyers they got the deal and you close on it sean    wow okay so the cool thing is there’s no marketing upfront involved unless marketing a few buyers list you build a relationship with other wholesalers and you sign some sort of contract with them an option with them what do you do anthony   yeah we did it an auction from real great friends of mine that i trusted they closed on it and they would give me like a marketing fee or something like that on the side to the title company and the title company would come here and check directly sean    right right okay cool all right so that’s cowholesaling and up to  in revenue so now the question becomes your buyers list how did you get such big buyer’s list anthony   well when i first got started i was apprenticing and bird dogging for another investor here in the st louis area and so i was constantly now selling his property that he would get off the courthouse bet in the mls i didn’t know the first thing about finding deals so he would get the deal and i would just sell them i would get on sites like meetupcom which is a huge advantage for people that don’t have a buyers list because there’s already a premade buyers list ready to go you just join the local reia meetup and then we had the mailing list in there that we can mail to the whole group and i send the property out that way and get it sold pretty quickly so i got really good at doing that sean     very smart anthony   yeah i would also do direct mail to buyers people that have bought a property in the last  months paid cash i would do a little bit of direct mail to those people and then just word of mouth networking and stuff like that sean    i like that so meetups that’s a first time i have heard that one where actually building a buyer’s list so explain that a little bit more in detail how you did that anthony   oh and i still do it to this day so i get on there you just go to meetupcom you need an account type of real estate and it brings up all these real estate groups in your market and i just joined the bigger ones there so what i would do is go in there i will say “hey anybody looking for wholesale properties in this area i get great rental wholesales all the time i get rehab deals all the time go to this website which would be my squeeze page it will direct to my squeeze page they will sign up doing that on my buyers list and stuff like that so i’ll send a… and i have got about  meetup groups in my market that are big in size i will go in there once a month send that out get some new buyers fresh buyers you always want to keep your list fresh because buyers going to die out every now and then they pull up their inventory and it kind of fall off and that so i always try to refresh my buyers list no matter what if i do that just market then tell them where my squeeze page is and sign up that way sean    okay so you would actually go into the meetup join the meetup in the comment section where make a comment so you comment and in that comment would go to everybody in that group is that correct anthony   i do that that’s called the discussion board where you can actually post the discussion and i do that too but a lot of people don’t like to take the time going there clicking on it it comes through the discussion board and look at your post whereas i go in there and some meetups actually have an email link that you can copy and paste to your sent email where it will actually email out to everybody in that group so it’ll hit their email directly versus them having to login themselves to meetup go to this discussion board and some series of things and hopefully they will see your ad whereas i actually email out to the entire group and it will email everybody in that group and so that is a good way of making sure they actually get it and they see it and the opportunity to go to my page and sign up for the wholesale properties or if i had a property i am trying to sell off also send it out on meetup that way it goes to everybody in that real estate group there are always buyers in real estate groups looking for dealers so it worked out well sean    and so this link this email link is it pulled out of meetup and then you put it in your own platform like your mail like outlook or is it something that you do inside of so they have this mail link inside of meetup that you can capture copy and paste the link put it in your outlook for an example and then send out a particular property or dealer something like that anthony   correct yes so you just go to like… like right now i am on it you just click on whatever group you’re in i click on discussions tab and will drop down a message board or mailing list and it says email the mailing list at and then it’s like for this one it says the spirit of st louis real estate club listmeetupcom so you just copy and paste that into your email whatever you use provider i use outlook and i just put that and send it to… there’s  people in this list so it will send it to  premade buyers for you sean    hey anthony anthony   what sean    can i just tell you something anthony   yeah sean    that’s brilliant that is brilliant that is gold dude that is absolutely brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant anthony   yeah so i mean that’s just the way i had a… when you’re not bringing deals and the only way i can use money back in the day was to sell property i had to get really good at selling properties and finding buyers and so that is just one of the things i always did and that was only an example  buyers in this one group i mean there are groups out there there are another couple of groups i mean they had thousands of buyers for you that are free that maybe want to be on your direct buyers list whenever i had a property like i said i always get out there and i blast it on those meetups and put it on postlets and that seems everything else but meetup is definitely a good tool that you have to use sean    that is one of the smartest slickest things i have heard in a very very long time dude that is ninja ninja ninja ninja i am telling you people are listening right now and they’re freaking out i can feel that they’re going “oh my god it’s incredible” so that is a… and i’ve been doing this for a long time and we have… i mean i have a meetup group so we have  to  wholesalers come into my office every single month and stuff like that but i know that we can email through the platform out to them but i have never heard that before but think about the genius of that right not only you can tap into buyers locally to the big reia groups and stuff like that but also to other wholesalers where you can send out something saying “hey if you wholesalers are out there i have got a huge list if you are looking to sell your properties bring them here i can help you out” i mean not only can it help you in your cowholesaling business but it can help you to sell proprieties too again that is a brilliant piece of gold nugget right there that you just brought that’s awesome dude anthony   definitely definitely yeah sean    okay so i have… we got to go back i haven’t asked you about prior to real estate how did you get into real estate anthony   oh man yeah so i had the worst lot back in the day when i was younger getting laid off from jobs here and there i was in the healthcare for a long time as a nurse assistant and i thought i wanted to be in healthcare and so i figured that will be okay to always have a job but i guess back in the days it’s just… i just always had bad luck getting laid off so like  i got laid off again from a warehouse job making  a year just sitting at my computer and i just “i got to do something i got to do something i can’t keep doing this i’m getting older i wanted actually to have a life i wanted to be able to do things” sean    right anthony   and so i was sitting on my computer and i was like “well one of my family members said to me ‘you always talk about doing real estate how about you be a real estate agent” so i said “okay we’ll get on youtube and kind of see what it takes to be that so i got on there started googling how to do that and on the right side of the screen and i think it was you i can’t quite remember but i think it was sean terry himself on the side of the screen with some video saying something crazy like “make  in a week or seven days or  days or something like that” and i was like “that’s crap that’s never going to work’ i’m a big skeptic of all that and i clicked on it so thank god i clicked on it because from there i watched all your videos on youtube and all these great content that you had and it really helped out i mean you were just so simple about explaining everything i just… i was watching everything and i think about two months solid i would get up at  in the morning sit on the computer and watch every single video and listen to every single podcast at  to  in the morning to  at night and i get up and i did that for two months because they told me it took everybody that long to do that i am very analytical i got to read everything and watch everything before i actually take action which is just the kind of person i am so after doing that i got started i contacted every big investor in st louis just by typing ‘we buy houses” and i send them an email saying “hey do you need an apprentice i need to get started i will help you find properties just teach me how to do this i’m handson i’ll help you find deals quickly” one guy got back to me and that’s how i started so i was able to move back to st louis and get started doing that so i thank god it all worked out and thank god i saw your video that day sean    that’s awesome and you got still anthony   i could have been a real estate agent right now so i am glad i’m on the other half sean    yeah it’s funny when i got started my wife said “you got to be a real estate agent” so i bought all the books of real estate agents started studying and i was like “it just did not feel right for me i didn’t really want to be an agent” nothing against agents because my wife is actually a real estate agent herself and for her she loves the hunt and helping people find a house for me it just didn’t work for me so i am glad i kind of tripped into the investing arena it’s lot more fun lot more money anthony   yeah yeah and i am definitely glad i found something that i can build and something that i control not somebody that is telling me when to i can go on break or when i can go and use the restroom or when i can do this when can i see my family or what holidays can i have off it’s something that i can do i can build and it’s my life sean    that’s killer okay so now let’s go back to beginning  and let’s talk about the things you did different in  to increase your revenue by  so you said you did direct mail and so let’s talk about the… what do you believe is like your topperforming list in  anthony   so in  i made a goal to be more consistent just with my thinking because i had to be more consistent i was kind of “if i make some money here that would be great” and then i would be broke again you know what i mean i do a deal then two months later i hadn’t done anything and then i’ll do another one so i just finally said “screw them i’ll put all my money together i’m just going to start every quarter everything in the quarter i’m listing one big campaign and do it that way so i was like “okay every quarter was a big campaign” so i did absentee owners with equity so i did absentee owners with equity which was obviously… i mean that’s my biggest producer here in my area i also did owneroccupied houses with high equity and then i had messed around with some smaller ones like probate divorce noted some people they didn’t really produce in my area like i was hoping to like i can concentrate on the things that are actually worked – absentee owners and stuff like that and then also bandit signs trying to get those out there every weekend and stuff like that sean    cool cool okay and then would you primarily send a postcard would you send a letter or would you send a yellow letter what do you do anthony   i did postcard just so i can reach more people with less money… that’s kind of how i did it first i have always done postcards which is what i love the ability to just hit on a huge amount of people versus yellow letters it costs a little bit more i’m sure the return rate is a lot better but this way we can get more people consistently or i mean i guess more sean    more broader reach… anthony    with a budget yeah with the budget that i was on i can hit him more repetitive than i could with yellow letters costing me  apiece versus the postcards cost like  apiece so that’s why i chose that route sean    right and then what about frequency so you got a list let’s say you have theoretically less than  what would be your frequency on that list anthony    well in  i was doing like a big list like that once in quarter so once a quarter i would get on that get on whatever site i was using the mail one out and i would do like  mailers and so i would take that and i would break that  down into like  to  campaigns where they go out once every week or once every two weeks something like that to where i had it at like a  or  hitting every week until the whole  was gone in that way one advantage is it doesn’t overwhelm me you don’t have  hitting at one time you will run around like “oh my god” and “what’s going on” and stuff like that so that is a lot easier still pretty hectic but it made it a lot better to handle the volume that i was doing at that time and… sean    so it’s manageable you can manage it and so you’re essentially hitting that list  times a year which is good okay and then so you answered all the calls and what is your like weekly schedule look like did you like answer calls on monday tuesday wednesday or did you set up appointments for wednesday thursday how is your week like anthony   i answered calls sunday through sunday sean i mean there is no break when you buy yourself i mean if you don’t answer that call maybe a deal has been out lot on that deal and here’s a small big city it’s pretty competitive in direct mail usually a seller will call me and they’re like “yeah i will get nine of these i’m just calling down the list and i’m seeing what your office is” that’s the typical call i get so i mean if you have to be really aggressive once you get a call and they seem motivated and then they’re within your range i mean either i am emailing the contract right on the phone “hey i’m selling this unless you sign and get it back to me and we will get everything going on it” or i’m out there trying to meet him as soon as possible so i mean i didn’t have a set schedule monday wednesday friday answering phones tuesday thursday i am out looking at properties it looks like monday i’m looking i’m answering calls if a person calls me and i need to see the house i’m also going out there that monday same day and seeing the house so i can get that deal so i can have both my business and everything else sean    that’s called hustle that’s the way well people in the real estate turn your phone off on saturday and sundays and stuff like that and when you hustle i mean think about  a year not… i mean that’s less than  of the population ever make that money and then those guys make   a year goes “do i really have to work on weekends” i was like “really it’s your business you’re hustling man you’re blowing it up” if you get calls coming in on sunday at  and you know it’s a deal get on it right so… anthony    right yeah and i just still feel guilty sitting there on saturday and say i got four calls waiting for me i can’t sit there and try to enjoy my day because i’m thinking “oh man that’s a  deal right there” but if somebody’s there talking with somebody else on the phone i need to be on the on the phone right now calling back to see what’s going on if it’s nothing it is nothing but if it’s a deal… and yeah there were times that i did that on a saturday night or sunday morning or sunday night and it was a deal like  or something like that on the whole deal that i could have potentially missed out on because i was like “yeah i already told tuesday to make an appointment with the man” sean    yeah and that separates someone that is average that someone is above average taking that extra step and i can’t do it either i mean we must be coming from the same class because i can’t if i know like… for example this morning at  a deal came in and i knew it was a smoking deal they wanted  for property the stuff in there is going for  so i immediately sent it over to jerri beth and rafael and rafael that’s his territory it says “listen” i said “call these guys asap and set an appointment it is a smoking deal” and i give him like  minutes to respond back but rafael responded back less than  minutes he said “okay i’ll get him on the phone talk to him get appointment set today for ” so it’s that type of hustle that it takes this business because as the marketing increases the inventory decreases it becomes a seller’s market sellers have now options if they have options and someone is picking his nose and they get… saturday night they get a lead that comes in and they’re not going to come until monday afternoon or monday morning guess what you’ve already been to the house and you already got the deal under contract before they even wake up on monday morning so… anthony   yeah yeah exactly sean    that’s awesome okay so you said that you sometimes when you’re talking to them on the phone you get a contract over to them asap how has that been working for conversions for you anthony    well usually if i get to the point where i say “hey i’m going to email you this contract” it’s pretty much a  conversion just because if i feel that i can send the contract to him right now and they’re going to sign it and then yeah i’m going to definitely make that effort and get that typed as quick as possible and email it over to him and let them know that “hey this is coming in your inbox here in five minutes take a look at it if you have any questions about it please give me call you have my number and we will walk through it with you if need be and then once you sign that give that back to me i love to meet you out at this property just to do a quick walk through to make sure there’s no big issue going on and then if not hey we’re going to get this over to the title company here and they will get it closed as soon as possible for you” and usually like i said if they’re that motivated where i can send them a contract like that it’s usually   conversion because they’re like “yeah yeah send them over” i take a look at it we’ll sign it and then we’ll email it back to you or we will meet you at the property with the contract something like that sean    right so you eliminate that entire “okay well let’s set an appointment” then you meet him the next day and whatever like that you just get the contract in the inbox asap anthony   yeah because i’ve lost them before and i am like “i will meet you at the property” and then i call back like may be an hour before the appointment the next day or something and they’re “oh i’m sorry” and so and so because they met me yesterday or they met me this morning i mean i was about there this afternoon and they were already within my range my price range and it’s like “well damn if i would have been there i would have just sent you the contract and you could have signed it and i could have met you today or something” you know what i mean or something like that so i just bring in the contract “hey i’ll meet you there after you sign it or just…” whatever maybe sean    well i mean it’s smart because if you… i mean the result that you want is to get the contract so every step in between that you can eliminate is your fastest path to actually getting the result you want and if you can get him on the phone and get him to agree on a price and once you agree on a price and then it just becomes a walkthrough situation then great “here’s the price send the contract” boom and then you get it in and then you pretty much eliminate everybody else from the equation anthony    yeah exactly you can deal with issues if the house is on a contract you can’t deal with issues if you don’t have it on a contract you lost it you lost the deal so if you can get under a contract you have more you can deal with things because now you safely have it under contract you don’t have to worry about the money going in there and getting it from you because you have it sean    right another another awesome awesome tip all right so direct mail postcard frequency about every quarter and then what did you say your next best marketing campaign was anthony   i’m trying to just all direct and directly i mean i try to hit that and hit that hard and hit it frequently yeah like i said owneroccupied highequity absenteeowner but i had a couple of others and all of this going as well i did google adwords kind of the half the latter half year it was okay i don’t know what’s going on with it really if it’s just my market or what but i had an actual people managing kind of manage it for me and keeping track of things and it has been pretty competitive too online here i noticed i increased my budget on that but they had already been producing kind of… it’s about thousands of dollars on average or not too much coming in so i had to pull that one down well the stuff is where it works my main thing towards for  was stick to what works and what not like cater off and do other crazy things like i keep on value packing things like that i blow off money on before and advertising on the back of every seat so i still have done that before making thousands of dollars with no result so i stuck with what works what i know works and that would be in  for me just picking with what i know works and get me results sean    yeah and it’s… and i guess about mine is that i always tell people i said like “pick a marketing campaign whether it be google ad words whether it be direct mail whether it be tv radio whatever the case may be once you find something that works and you have direct mail that works for you then it just becomes maxing out that channel to the max and then when you’re completely full throttle on that particular campaign then you can move to other campaigns and start testing you know what i mean you can move to google ad words but the problem is a lot of people get in and they go “oh my gosh i got to do google i got to send out  postcards and then i have got to do this and i have got to do that and i have got to do this…” and they want to get all the lines in the ocean so they can have that but if they just focus on one line and making that line with the best bait possible maxing it out guess what you do more business you’ll be more focused and then you can start adding channels down the road in my situation right now we are trying to grab leads from everywhere we’re maxed out on pretty much every single channel that we tapped into so now we are looking for more creative channels to tap into or different markets we can max out the channel so it’s like a different scenario three years from now two years from now a year from now when you’re making doing  million  million a year revenue and you’re going to be going “okay where else can i market” right it’s like where else can i just drop in  and  mailers a month and you maxed out on google and you maxed out on everywhere in the newspapers and stuff like that then you start looking for other different avenues but the exciting thing is the potential is there you know what i mean the reach is there i mean it’s like you are driving in first gear and wait till you’re in fifth gear and you are going  miles an hour  miles an hour down the street it’s exciting cool cool cool all right and that’s been awesome advice now let’s talk about your actual appointment and what has been some key things for you at the particular appointments so you meet with them you go to their house and stuff and you build the rapport with them what has been key for you to actually getting the seller to sign the contract with you versus anybody else anthony   yeah sure so being first involved and listening to the big thing taking the time actually to listen instead of hear them actually talk with them about the house talk to them about the family what’s going on the stuff like that that kind of open him up a little bit and don’t just get there and start throwing up things and there “that needs to be fixed that’s broken that looks like crap over there i don’t like this and i’ll be around ” so you kind of want to be a little gentler than that i have noticed so that will help you out a lot explain the process that’s another thing i mean explain the process it’s a lot i mean it’s very helpful you sit down at the kitchen table or you sit down on the couch and you just “hey this is how it’s going to work we’re going to look over this together if you have any questions you ask me even when you sign it you’re going to have my cell phone number so give me a call anytime during the process you’re also going to have the title company’s information you are going to have their email their phone number my email my phone number so if you have any questions during the process you are going to be able to give me a call” and then also there’s a thousand ways we expect to close and then you going to get cash at closing you can send your finance or anything like that and we are going to handle everything so you don’t need to fix anything you don’t need to fix the kitchen or do this or that and then also if you have any junk in the house if you have an old couch or the basement is cluttered with old clothes or furniture and stuff like that don’t worry about it because a lot of sellers they’re kind of apprehensive i noticed about “well i got all this stuff in the basement and i don’t know when i’m going to have the time or money to… i don’t know who or what kind of help i can get to get all the stuff out of the house” that has actually helped largely “leave anything in the house that you want to leave take out that is all yours but take anything this is your property so take anything you want to take the clothes or furniture that you want and then anything that is junk leave it behind we’re going fix up the property anyway so we’re going to have it done starting here to throw away all the stuff for you and make it a lot easier for you “oh okay well that works that’s really easy” so we explain the process and how it works it helps a lot and goes a long way sean    well what’s interesting about that and i’m glad you said that because this business is in a robotic checklist of what to do when you meet with the seller if a person on the other hand they have issues they have a story they have problems they have apprehensions they don’t really know the process and the problem is that a lot of times we go in and especially if you’re going on multiple appointments a week you tend to forget what a person they’re going through but if you put yourself back and kind of put yourself and almost like have empathy put yourself in their shoes and feel that “listen they’re brandnew they don’t know the process they don’t understand what’s going on and if you come from that standpoint i can tell the way you talk and the way you just explain that is that you make someone very comfortable to do business with you and you answer a lot of the unknown questions which again makes people comfortable to do business with you whereas someone else might come in and just walks you the house and look at the repairs you know not really get to know them or their situation of why they’re selling or the problem they can solve throw some number out in the air and then the seller goes “well let me think about it” and then they walk out of the house so i think that is a key critical important knowing that this is a people business so… anthony    yeah yeah it definitely is and it helps a lot sean    that’s pretty cool okay now from when you get your contract so when you get it signed from your seller to actually selling the property and close it do you have any idea what that time frame is anthony   my time frame on getting it closed sean    yeah so typically your average time frame so to give some perspective because so when you get it signed from a seller and you meet with them and you get it signed that day and let’s say you know it’s on a thursday whatever friday monday whatever and then from the time you market it and you put it out to a buyer and then the buyer is closing it from the contract signing with the seller to actually closing and getting your check you know what your average timeframe is anthony   i have been shooting for a week i have been trying… that’s what i’ve really been trying to do for a while back in  i was using a title company and they were taking forever just to get the title work done and it’s two weeks three weeks to get the title working and this and that and so i had to change it up get a different title company that is a lot better like they can give a title within a fourday period or something like that a week so i’ll try to get in as soon as i get on the contract i will put it up on my site i will send it out to my buyers list i will send it out on meetup i will post it on postlets anything else that i can do and then hopefully get under contract that day and then get it aligned up to working easily within like a week and a half kind of period week or two weeks sean    yeah and i think that is incredibly important for the velocity of business and with the money how the money flows because if you can get a deal signed and then turn around and get paid on it a week later that means the marketing money is getting… basically you return up money asap and the profit where then you can reinvest back in the marketing and essentially do more deals it accelerates that entire process from start to finish and that’s how you can double and triple your income so something interesting right now and you’re taking  days  days  days to go from contract to close then that whole time frame if you can cut that time frame down it’s important now do you happen to know your kpi by any chance and if you don’t that’s okay because  of people don’t i’m the kind of freak that does anthony   yeah yeah no i can’t say that i do too well sean    right and i think going into  if you really dial in on those average contract value your cost per lead and your leads per contract if just those three kpis if you dial in those it gives you a lever that you can push to increase that revenue and which i think is cool all right book what is your favorite book anthony   i don’t really… i’m reading so many books right now i’m kind of all over the place right now i am reading the emyth for real estate investors the new book that came out by michael gerber and than merrill i got that one going and it is a pretty interesting book i have been liking that i got another stuff i am reading like hour work week a lot of rich dad books like cashflow quadrant and stuff like that a lot of those typical real estate books are kind of what i’m reading right now sean    oh it’s interesting the emyth it comes from the perspective of the operator since now that you’re… i think your transition from doing everything yourself to actually having a team i think emyth is probably an incredibly important book for you along with i would recommend traction but then knowing those key… keyemployees that you need like a lead manager that can answer a phone for you and then find some that’s going to be an outside sales person acquisition guy and then disposition guy you’re just a handful of couple of hirers away from where you get in a position where you go “holy cow this is amazing” now you built the business you understand the process you know the objections you understand what conversion rate and what it takes to make a revenue now you can then turn around and teach and train other people to where now you build yourself that freedom to take it to the next level and you sell like… you sound obviously a really smart guy and you can now do things in your business that will increase the marketing become more efficient and then take it from  a year to  a month and that’s what it takes is building that team and being able to have an awesome team and then the cool thing is making  a month and being in the caribbean anthony   yeah that’s my next step i will definitely do that i am working on that  was just kind of get things in line and make sure it really works and kind of putting things a little bit more and use all of my systems and streamline everything to where i can grow the business and work on the business and get some stuff in place and make more revenue come in and things like that sean    right all right so tell me about your family anthony   my family well we’re all from midmissouri i moved… i kind of moved in there i’m getting a little bit of too much family here in the city i got some family over in illinois the side of things just got a little reverted but… sean    so are you married with kids anthony   family family sean    family family so are married with kids or just single anthony    oh no i’m newly engaged i will be getting married this fall so i’m busy doing that yeah i’m busy doing that as well this year things gone that and stuff like that luckily my fiancée she has been very helpful with training and getting stuff online so i can help out when i can but i also focus on other things to get this up and going so that way we can hopefully retire at early age and have fun and be on that caribbean island and making you six figures a month and enjoy life instead of working  hours or  hours a week or whatever maybe and stuff like that so sean    right and so okay now how old are you anthony     i’ll be  this july sean    sweet  years old that’s young man of what you got going on at that young of age do you have any idea  years from now you are going to own the world anthony   yeah i think about that from time to time it’s quite when you guy started yourself sean back in  and where you are and then  years later then look at you i kind of sometimes just in my office kind of think like “wow i’ve been doing this for three years what is going to be like in five what’s it going to be like in ten if i did  in my second or third year what’s my tenth year going to look like” it’s just crazy to see the possibilities with it sean    it’s insane it’s insane your brain can’t actually even function i mean it’s like you go “okay  million parable what would happen if i win that” it’s like you’re ranging the key as fast and whatever okay and then lastly what would be one piece of advice you give someone that is new there and thinking about getting started they kind of don’t know about it and they kind of on that fence and they hear you and you have been doing it for three years you have had this success got some great tips and stuff what would be some good advice there for someone that can push him over the edge anthony   to get started in wholesaling sean    yeah so they’re brand new they maybe never done a deal before or they maybe they have done one or two deals what is some great advice you could give them that if you put yourself back back then when you are first getting started and you are still trying to find your way what would you tell anthony   yeah so first i would learn what the system like how to actually get things done if you don’t know that and obviously you’re not going to know how to get it done and how to get that check at the end of the day like i started listening to the flipfreedom podcast that way you understand how the contract works how talking to sellers work how talking to buyers work how they interact with the title company how to interact with just things that happen on that daily basis getting the deal on the contract and then following the deals so that’s kind of what i called education and that’s the time i saw that video that day on youtube and i watched everything that i could and then i was able to… i kind of knew how to get started and so my next action was “okay well now i need to call sellers” so i got on and that is how i got my first deal i just called people on for sale by owner and started talking to them until i got a guy i’m on and that was that i was able to get the contract and then get that to the title company and then find a buyer and got my first check so just education find something to follow find something to learn the process for me it was here sean terry and stuff so thank you for that sean i owe everything to you buddy sean    that’s awesome man and i think that’s great advice because i think education puts you in the fear… gets you over the fear of the unknown but you did two different things not only did you educate yourself but then also you took massive action to go out and get that result a lot of people go into this education mode and they just go from… that’s all they do is educate themselves but they never take action and that’s the important thing where you learned about something and then you went applied it and it’s almost like it’s like the education is there that will bring you to the next step so now when it comes to talking to sellers well the next step is then well what do you do at the appointment    well then you can educate yourself prior to going the appointment then you go in the appointment so it’s that the education shows up or is… i would rather have someone get educated while taking action instead of just going through everything getting fully educated and then now forgetting the steps it becomes more… for me i guess at least it’s when i’m applying as i’m being educated the results come a lot quicker and i need to know what i need to know when i need to know instead of knowing everything and then forgetting it as i go through the process which is cool anthony   definitely i still listen to all your podcast today and all your videos and cooking art and stuff like that so you always going to continue the education i just listened to your other podcast that came up just the other day on getting your mind right for the new year and staying in focus involved with the traction and stuff like that so it was really good sean    that’s awesome well congratulations anthony i’m so excited for you you have done phenomenal things thank you for sharing all your great information and congratulations to you and your new fiancée and i see you guys are going to get married and that’s going to be awesome go on a killer vacation have a blast and enjoy yourself and don’t feel too guilty and that’s the cool thing is as a solopreneur you kind of get that guilty feeling because you’re not on that hustle but i can just tell you once you have a team built and that guilt feeling does go away and it’s a very… it’s a peaceful relaxing type of sensation so i look forward to seeing your progress and then have you come back on the show maybe at the end  to see how that implementations happened so congratulations anthony   definitely thank you very much sean thank you sean    all right guys we are going to sign off here and thank you so much all

itself – or even might provide some potential benefits – will inevitably become a tool of oppression by government and law enforcement specifically so while this new technology could possibly prove useful in terms of the supply chain and shipping concerns in  any technology that is invented and released will immediately be picked up by the relevant government agencies of surveillance and control
