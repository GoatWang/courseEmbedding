review the jpmorgan global allocation fund i class shares returned  in june equities continued to deliver strong returns led by emerging markets and japan emerging market equities broadly outperformed developed markets returning  and  respectively european equities saw a pullback in june global bonds sold off in june initially triggered by marginally hawkish comments from the president of the european central bank this sentiment was echoed across the major central banks throughout the month the federal reserve fed increased interest rates and indicated it expects one more increase if the economy performs as expected in addition the fed detailed a plan for unwinding its  trillion balance sheet which could begin before the end of  us employment report data announced at the beginning of june disappointed despite the disappointment relative to expectations the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in  years news of high inventory levels and rising us production drove oil prices to a sevenmonth low looking ahead we maintain conviction in our prorisk positioning in light of the pickup in the economic growth outlook which has also led us to more regionally diversify this exposure outside the us we also maintain a more balanced currency exposure between the us dollar and global currencies given our view that the growth and interest rate gap is closing between the us and the rest of the world we continue to focus our risk in global equities and continue to increase exposure to both developed international and emerging markets equities to further diversify equity risk within developed international and emerging markets equities the fund is near its highest allocations held since inception given the expectation for potential future market volatility we hold some of our global equity exposure in call options as a way to manage risk but still capture potential market gains we continue to believe that credit will be the most attractive area within fixed income and strongly emphasize our credit positions relative to global government bonds within credit we diversify our exposure within high yield emerging markets debt nonagency mortgages and investmentgrade corporates however given our view that equities will outperform high yield we have reduced highyield exposure to focus our risk within equities and limit downside risk in the fund

carefully before investing source morningstar the fund has one of the longest manager tenure as defined by morningstar among funds in morningstars world allocation category ‡the morningstar analyst rating is not a credit or risk rating it is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of morningstar inc morningstar evaluates funds based on five key pillars which are process performance people parent and price morningstars analysts use this fivepillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a riskadjusted basis analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research and the weighting of each pillar may vary the analyst rating ultimately reflects the analysts overall assessment and is overseen by morningstars analyst rating committee the approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across morningstars global coverage universe the analyst rating scale ranges from gold to negative with gold being the highest rating and negative being the lowest rating a fund with a “gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts highest level of conviction analyst ratings are reevaluated at least every  months for more detailed information about morningstars analyst rating including its methodology please click here the morningstar analyst rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund morningstar analyst ratings are based on morningstars current expectations about future events therefore in no way does morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such morningstar analyst ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause morningstars expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected the fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions international investing involves risks including risks related to foreign currency limited liquidity less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political economic or other developments these risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets fixed income risks include interestrate and credit risk typically when interest rates rise there is a corresponding decline in bond values credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments noninvestmentgrade debt securities highyieldjunk bonds may be subject to greater market fluctuations risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities asset allocation strategies do not assure profit and do not protect against loss the fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility shortselling entails special risks if the fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value the fund will lose value any loss on short positions may or may not be offset by investing shortsale proceeds in other investments performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost all returns assume reinvestment of all dividends performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted investing involves risk including possible loss of principalfund details holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the funds nav at the end of the period some blackrock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields there is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower the funds are distributed by blackrock

overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high low this funds expenses are rated as low because they are below the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds

funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the

review the jpmorgan global allocation fund i class shares returned  in june equities continued to deliver strong returns led by emerging markets and japan emerging market equities broadly outperformed developed markets returning  and  respectively european equities saw a pullback in june global bonds sold off in june initially triggered by marginally hawkish comments from the president of the european central bank this sentiment was echoed across the major central banks throughout the month the federal reserve fed increased interest rates and indicated it expects one more increase if the economy performs as expected in addition the fed detailed a plan for unwinding its  trillion balance sheet which could begin before the end of  us employment report data announced at the beginning of june disappointed despite the disappointment relative to expectations the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in  years news of high inventory levels and rising us production drove oil prices to a sevenmonth low looking ahead we maintain conviction in our prorisk positioning in light of the pickup in the economic growth outlook which has also led us to more regionally diversify this exposure outside the us we also maintain a more balanced currency exposure between the us dollar and global currencies given our view that the growth and interest rate gap is closing between the us and the rest of the world we continue to focus our risk in global equities and continue to increase exposure to both developed international and emerging markets equities to further diversify equity risk within developed international and emerging markets equities the fund is near its highest allocations held since inception given the expectation for potential future market volatility we hold some of our global equity exposure in call options as a way to manage risk but still capture potential market gains we continue to believe that credit will be the most attractive area within fixed income and strongly emphasize our credit positions relative to global government bonds within credit we diversify our exposure within high yield emerging markets debt nonagency mortgages and investmentgrade corporates however given our view that equities will outperform high yield we have reduced highyield exposure to focus our risk within equities and limit downside risk in the fund additionally we maintain exposure to government bonds as a way to manage risk within the fund fees and minimums fees widget loading  portfolio portfolio widget loading  management fund managers
