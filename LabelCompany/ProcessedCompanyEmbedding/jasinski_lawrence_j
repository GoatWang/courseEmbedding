recent press releases and sec filingsand with that ill turn the call over to rewalks ceo larry jasinskilawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director thank you llanit good morning everyone and thank you for joining us we had an excellent first quarter with record revenue of  million including a record  favorable commercial coverage decisions with a total of  rewalk placements we made meaningful progress with the va and with commercial payers on the reimbursement front and we moved closer to a design freeze on our stroke productread moreas we indicated in our last call our focus is on working with the va to qualify and expedite processing of veterans via the coop study and the sop program securing broader reimbursement coverage in the us and germany with both corporate entities and commercial providers and finalizing the design initial production and clinical study setup to support regulatory filings and late  commercialization of the restore soft exoskeleton product for stroke patients im pleased to report on all of these fronts we had encouraging and demonstrable results that show the promise and growth that is developing with this new industrywe continue to make progress in building our business with the va during the first quarter the va placed an order of  units for its coop study of which  units were shipped in q this purchase will allow each of the  coop study sites to be fully active and recruiting subjects by midyear as a reminder this multiyear study will evaluate  subjects in  cohorts  using the rewalk exoskeleton and  in the control armthe study design is focused on home and community use and is the first randomized and most comprehensive study being conducted on the benefits of using exoskeleton technology in the world today the study is making meaningful progress with the first  study sites recruiting  users to date  were in the control arm and  were in the rewalk arm and enrollment is on schedule all  participants in the study are eligible to receive an exoskeleton once they complete their followupveterans who enter the study in  will be eligible to receive their own rewalk in late  and  of  those entering the coop study in the first half of  may move to the sop process later in the year veterans that participate in the rewalk cohort may move to the sop process to acquire a system for home use and those in the wheelchair cohort will have the opportunity to proceed through the vas sop rewalk training processwe continue to be encouraged by the significant support we see out of washington from the white house and congress the newlyformed white house office of american innovation has indicated that a top priority will be reimagining veterans affairs and the newlyappointed va secretary dr david shulkin has echoed that the va is a top priority for the president with a proposal to increase the vas budget making it one of the few federal departments with a proposed budgetary increase we are optimistic that there is positive momentum to review and expedite programs within the vawe continue to advocate one that the va expand the choices and locations available to veterans to train on the rewalk system so the many veterans who are now waiting can train closer to where they live two that the waiting times be reduced by providing resources for training in locations where veterans have been requesting help since the coverage decision was made in  and three that the va increase the visibility of the sop policy so that veterans who are not aware of this benefit can be consideredwhile its still early in the process we feel good about the focus and momentum within the va and the broader commitment in washington to service the needs of paralyzed veterans which includes providing the rewalk deviceon the reimbursement front we continue to make progress with commercial payers selfinsurers and managed care providers within the us we are continuing multiple highlevel detailed meetings with  large insurance providers based on those discussions we are reiterating our midyear target for a top commercial payer to make a determination regarding a broad coverage policy for the rewalk personal devicein parallel corporate selfinsurance groups and municipal coverage groups are closely examining the possibility of covering their employees additionally were making progress with other groups for example genex which is one of the most experienced national managed care providers for injured workers released a remarkable video about their coverage impact on an injured police officer he was the first police officer covered and is now  of  worldwide the genex video cites how his pain medicines are now no longer needed and how his frequent urinary tract infections have been reduced this validates our belief that payers and providers increasingly recognize the value of our technologyin germany were in advanced discussions with  groups in our efforts to drive broader coverage for individuals with spinal cord injury the first group is a large social health insurance group with which we have over  pending insurance claims our successes with  social court decisions in germany in  have helped to facilitate these discussions which we believe will likely result in a coverage policy around midyearthe second group bg is the governing body of workmans compensation groups in germany the bg has increased its activity with  new rental coverages in q in its  annual report it indicated the intent to develop a unified coverage policy for all workmans compensation cases at bg facilities across germany and this will allow therapy with exoskeletons to become more transparent we believe such policy will be similar to the vas sop and we look forward to updating you on these developments in the coming monthswe have a total of  pending insurance claims in the pipeline with  in the us and  in germany representing potential revenue of over  millionoutside of our direct markets we saw the first positive coverage decision for training in australia by the ndis which covers national disability insurance they provided this coverage for paul jenkins who recently rewalked across the parliamentary stage at the university of canberra to receive  bachelors degrees paul is a determined young man who looks forward to permanently setting aside his wheelchair the ndis decision and the great success of mr jenkins are precedentsetting and provides hope to many other trained rewalkers in australia the efforts with the ndis are now progressing to an application for funding a system for him to use in everyday lifeturning to rd we continue to make progress in advancing the soft exoskeleton device for stroke to the next stage we are moving from concept to production and anticipate that our first commercial systems will be benchtested this quarter we are looking forward to additional physician feedback on the advanced designs later this month which we expect will allow us to complete final testing and adjustments for clinical use this will be followed by clinical use of our first commercial design which we expect will occur in  of  and then fda studies starting in the first half of  our goal remains to target commercialization at the end of we believe that the disruptive uniqueness of this lightweight compact economical patientfriendly design along with the size of the market and the preexisting reimbursement codes that allow rehab centers to immediately have a profitable business case all combine to make this a compelling product that will drive the next stage of the exoskeleton industryoverall weve made good progress with each of our goals  advancing efforts with the va through the coop study and with potential changes in access policy with the sop discussions with commercial players on broad coverage contracts and with our innovative soft suit exoskeleton for stroke and other lower limb disabilities we believe were on the right path as we continue to build the foundation of this new industryid like to turn the call over to kevin now to review our first quarter  financial results and then open the call for your questionskevin hershberger rewalk robotics ltd  cfo thanks larry q revenue was  million compared to  million in the prior year quarter and included  favorable commercial coverage decisions   in the us and  in germany we placed a total of  units of which  were in the us consisting of  for the va study one for a veteran covered under the va sop and  covered by commercial insurance the remaining  units were placed in europeas ive done in the past id like to give you some additional detail on our rental units we had  renttopurchase units placed during the first quarter including one with the va and we had  previouslyrented units that were converted to purchases we currently have  open trials including  active rentals and  claimed that have completed their trial period and are awaiting final insurance decisionsgross margin improved to  for q driven by increased volume conversion of rental units to purchases favorable geographic mix impacting our asps and lower product cost total operating expenses for the quarter were  million compared to  million in the prior year period as we discussed on the last call we have implemented initiatives to reduce operating expenses the full impact of which will become more visible throughout the yearnet loss for the quarter was  million compared to a net loss of  million in the first quarter of  and we ended the quarter with  million in cashwith that id like to open the call for questions operator please go ahead with the instructionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of matt obrien from piper jaffrayjonathan preston mckim piper jaffray companies research division  research analyst this is jp on for matt i wanted to start first with in germany it seems like youre seeing a lot of good uptake there how much of that is from i think it was last summer you had the german social court ruling and so maybe talk a little bit about that tailwind thats provided for you guys and then just in terms of patient awareness building now that its getting more and more often covered in germany are you seeing more patients kind of funnel into the pipeline and should we think about that as a good precedence for the uslawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director clearly those court cases last summer did have an impact because the groups that were talking to on contractual and policy side now have many cases that are pending and theyre also some of the same groups that have done the large number of rentals we had in the first quarter here so the pattern is what we hoped it would be in germany and we believe the output at the end as some policies and contracts are established we believe roughly about midyearto the second half of your question what weve learned from the german audience is they dont go out and fundraise and look for these they believe that the government does have a responsibility to take care of their citizens and it will probably help us with an uptick on people that okay now i know how the system works and an important thing is if you look at the bg specifically their annual report and they did more rentals than anybody else is specifically targeting making the process more transparent thats the wording in their actual report and in the discussions were havingso this i think will help the users and will be continued growth i do think it translates to the us the va also has i think gained momentum as we can see in the success we had and the success weve had with the workmans comp groupskevin hershberger rewalk robotics ltd  cfo just to add to larrys comments the one group were talking with is a large social health insurance group and we have  claims with them now and a large part of that is the court case last summer that you referenced and larry referenced again the activity with the bg  of the  rentals were with bg groups in germanyjonathan preston mckim piper jaffray companies research division  research analyst got it and then i was trying to dig in on the va how much visibility do you have there because it seems like  i dont know if this is a pattern its like q last year they had a big order and then they kind of tailed off q this year they had another big order and it kind of tailed off again is that something we should think about as a pattern going forward or is it just you dont really have visibilitylawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director its more of a pattern of the study design so last year they ordered the initial inaudible units to get the first  centers up and running which they ordered them in q but they got them really up and running around midyear and what youve seen this second order that we just got also was to get the remaining  centers but the part that feeds into that and the part that was most important frankly for us to measure is okay theyve got  centers thatll be up and running now are they effectively accruing patients and they set their own goals as to when they did the study plan and the  patients that have already been enrolled in only half the centers is as theyve characterized it is exactly on schedule so i think its going to even out in its own way because the patients coming out of the study all become available in the sopadditionally the va does have some additional units budgeted we cant tell the timing when theyre going to order for the further units for the coop study whether its later this year or not but they do have additional budgeted units so i think this is the beginning of some quartertoquarter predictability because the patients coming out of the study inaudible a lot to usjonathan preston mckim piper jaffray companies research division  research analyst that makes sense and then the last one for me is on the commercial side it sounds like midyear this year is kind of building up to where you could get some more coverage contracts in germany some favorable decisions here in the us in a perfect world those all go well how should you think about the ramp throughout the end of this year in the back half and then the   or i guess more specifically what gives you confidence what are your conversations with these commercial payers that gives you a good feeling about them actually coming on board midyear this yearlawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director well the depth of the discussions  ill start in germany they to an extent because of the court cases and because of the number of pending cases we are far enough along in contracttype discussions to where were reasonably confident that the contract will happen were not absolutely certain of the timing but they have patients in lineto answer your question on implementation i think theres  stages to it those that had been waiting in the system for them where they have pending claims those will be shorterterm for us as kevin pointed out one of them has  pending claims i think youll see those come up in the monthtype cycle but new patients will probably between getting qualified and getting trained and actually getting their systems will be greater than  months cycle and will probably fall more into  but its making it predictable for both the patient us and eventually for you guyskevin hershberger rewalk robotics ltd  cfo yes this is kevin we said on the last call that we would expect the revenue to follow within  months after getting the claim and i think thats important as larry pointed out weve got some cases that are pending that would come through in the first  months i think the other part of it is  there are  important aspects of it the first is getting patients that are covered under those groups in through the process that now they know that they have coverage and i think the second aspect of that thats very important is as we have discussions with other groups so getting these first coverage decisions in the us and in germany are important because then it sets a precedence for discussions with other groups as were continuing to work on reimbursement and on the casebycase processing that were currently doing nowoperator your next question comes from the line of matt taylor from barclaysxuyang li barclays plc research division  research analyst this is xuyang li in for matt i guess maybe first just a  can you maybe talk about your manufacturing capacity and ability to meet demands from maybe a bolus of orders from the va or from broader reimbursement coveragekevin hershberger rewalk robotics ltd  cfo yes young this is kevin so  we manufacture through our contract manufacturer sanmina so our ability to ramp up is pretty quick on any product like this you have some longer lead times but were talking a couple months for a longer lead time so as we build the business we have the infrastructure in place to grow our manufacturing capacityxuyang li barclays plc research division  research analyst okay great what’s the  i guess one on the balance sheet just a  any plans to strengthen the balance sheet and maybe you can talk about priorities for cash usage in ongoing businesskevin hershberger rewalk robotics ltd  cfo so ill talk about priorities first we really said that were  weve laid out our priorities for the year and its really focused on the commercialization efforts and reimbursement for the existing product and the rd focus on our stroke product thats really what were focused on this year and well prioritize those areas as we go forwardin terms of the balance sheet weve said on the last call that we have sufficient resources to get us through our next key catalyst and then we would look at all of our opportunities we have an existing active atm program but we would also look at the markets both equity and debt markets to continue to fund the companyoperator and we have a question from the line of christian moore from jefferieschristian diarmud moore jefferies llc research division  equity associate maybe the first one just on im not sure if i missed it but if you gave the qualified lead number for the quarter just in terms of tracking thatkevin hershberger rewalk robotics ltd  cfo i dont think we gave the number but the number for the quarter was  one of the things that i want to point  we havent actually  well provide that number for your benefit if you want one of the things we actually havent been including that because as our business develops we have a lot of patients in the queue and its really about getting more targeted in that area we need a fewer number as were building this business out because theres more awareness of the device and of the industrychristian diarmud moore jefferies llc research division  equity associate great so you have more than enough to work with in the queue alreadylawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director we do but we want more so a lot of our other focus has been key opinion leaders particularly in germany and the united states because we believe having more physicians on the podium and also talking to their patients about why this should become the standard of care and why it is the standard of care for the right patients we find that helping us qualify our leads and move the leads forward more effectively so that has been a increased area of focus for us in getting these guys to  ill give an example of a couple of physicians that went out and presented at a workmans comp conference lately that has resulted directly in some patients in some cases that weve seen so those have been very effective for us as a way to move them through the system more effectivelychristian diarmud moore jefferies llc research division  equity associate great then maybe one on the rest of the world japan sales obviously a very strong fourth quarter in terms of the cadence for the year is that kind of the expectation that youll have strong backloaded years or is it just going to be lumpy in terms of when rental and full sale units come in for that segmentlawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director itll probably continue to be lumpy we cant completely control the rest of world although i would look at the activities we have the insurance efforts are not limited only to germany and the united states which those are the  we as a company are driving for example i cited what weve seen in australia the number of trained waiting for rewalk individuals in australia i dont know that we put that up publicly but the distributor there has in excess of  trained individuals that hopefully can find a path to get these and the coverage with the first by the ndis at least for training and now considering it for use is important and that translates to your question i think all of those individuals will accept it we cant tell when the australian government in that case will coverweve also seen activity in several other geographies as well that could result in boluses ph of orders like weve seen in prior years but the timing is  lumpy is the characterization i supposechristian diarmud moore jefferies llc research division  equity associate great thanks and then the last one just on the unit order from the va  coming through this quarter will that basically come in the next quarter or spread throughout the year im probably expecting a similar cadence to what we saw in  but just wanted to confirm thats how we should think about modeling that throughout the yearlawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director well the order of  is that we ship  in q well ship the other  in q and then if theres other orders from the va well obviously ship them dependent on the date we get them usually in the quarterchristian diarmud moore jefferies llc research division  equity associate and then when you ship it thats when youre booking them as placements rightkevin hershberger rewalk robotics ltd  cfo correctoperator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of steven lichtman from oppenheimerdenis edward kelleher oppenheimer  co inc research division  associate this is dennis in for steve first it sounds like you remain confident on coverage coming through from a national payer is it now more than one payer in the us that youre speaking with or could we see more than one in the us neartermlawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director we are directly speaking with  currently at one level and then were speaking to a lot of corporate and municipal groups in parallel so there is more than one that were speaking to with the same types of discussionsdenis edward kelleher oppenheimer  co inc research division  associate understood just to follow up there is the positive movement from them being a payer exposed to a lot of casebycase situations or is it from them being exposed to new datalawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director primarily data weve been fortunate in that groups that have good data specifically the va have been willing to share that data so they were able to examine not only the data we had from our clinical studies but they were able to examine some of the data privately from the va so it gave them a good basis to consider and thats where they stand today they have spent a lot of time looking at itdenis edward kelleher oppenheimer  co inc research division  associate great and i guess the last question just regarding data broadly speaking any update on new data we could see over the next  to  months that’s it for uslawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director we have our current study ongoing we would hope to do some interim reports i think the most substantial data you will see from the va but thats not in our control the randomized trial is right on target i dont know when they will choose to publish and be public theyve certainly provided accrual information which is what we cited today when theyre going to give more on results is as i said something we hope they do soon because we believe itll help usoperator your next question comes from the line of kyle rose from canaccordkyle william rose canaccord genuity limited research division  senior analyst a couple housekeeping and then another big picture one kevin could you give us a little more color on the metrics on the renttoown and the converts just to maybe break that out us versus ous as far as the  renttopurchase in the q and then if you could just kind of help us understand what that funnel looks likekevin hershberger rewalk robotics ltd  cfo so the renttopurchase units we had  renttopurchase units this quarter there was  in the us which was a va unit and then  in europe then we also had  conversions this quarter which  were in the us and  were in europekyle william rose canaccord genuity limited research division  senior analyst okay great and then wanted to talk a little bit on how youre seeing the marketplace and just any competitive pressures any increased competition just what the focus is from a competitive standpoint any update there either in the us or globallylawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director this is larry kyle we see the industry developing but at this point we really havent been running into each other in terms of competitive components we remain the most active in the united states on the personal sales and weve either sold them in different places or weve been able to sell where we were targeting same in germany generally right now the personal market is something that we have had the longest experience on with the sixth generation device and that seems to have worked well for usrelative to pricing kevin can address saps were really not getting any pressure there either competitively or from even the payers as i believe they see the value of what were doing to their patients and their customerskevin hershberger rewalk robotics ltd  cfo yes just to reiterate asp we have not seen any pushback from payers on asp and as i noted earlier our gross margins reflect that its more of a geographic mix because heavier weighted towards our direct market but we really havent had pushback on asplawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director yes and in the united states weve still remained  theres only one product besides ours thats fdacleared for personal use and similar in europe the other players havent made it into the  direct markets in any significant way the other area that ive seen more activity is on stroke clearly weve seen at least one of our competitors do a pretty good job in developing their structural exoskeleton there and i believe another one has begun a clinical trialso you also see i believe all  of the major competitors reaching to the stroke opportunity because of the size of the need and the effectiveness of exoskeletons in helping those patients were approaching it somewhat differently in terms of our product ours is really as weve described it a nonstructural system that is very lightweight and importantly for our point of view we like the business model of this one because theres a capital element to it but also theres replacement components that we have said it will change over time and theres some patientdisposable components that really makes it a very economical business modeland if we take existing reimbursement codes we would be able to present that to any laboratory and any clinic and give them a model as to how it would be a profitable proposition for them to take that particular design but the designs first inaudible would benefit the patient but economics was the second part of our consideration so i do see a lot of activity in the stroke areakyle william rose canaccord genuity limited research division  senior analyst and then just lastly on the expectation for some reimbursement decisions from the larger players youre talking about midyear was there a potential for us to see that inaudible before the end of the q i guess its midyear q q and then on that point i know youre going to stop short of giving longerterm guidance and thats not what im asking but how do we think about the time to then after a positive decision the time to which we should start to see a meaningful move in momentum in topline revenues is it  months that it needs to play through  months  months how do we think about thatlawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director the first part midyear the main reason weve given that is based on the level of interaction and general discussions weve had with the insurers but we dont control it so it could be q it could be q but its going to be seemingly at least decisions in that cycle based on the feedback the insurers have given us if you can get them on the line you can ask them the question instead of us because i cant answer it im sorry more than thatrelative to time once we get these coverage decisions we believe that the patients that are already in line at these specific insurers will be shorterterm less than  months most of those should come into our system so some of it could affect current year and we believe it will but most new patients will probably fall well beyond the  months before the time theyre qualified to get in the system get trained and the transaction is complete so part of these policies will have a bigger impact in  and  obviously as it becomes more routineoperator we have no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarkslawrence j jasinski rewalk robotics ltd  ceo and director we
