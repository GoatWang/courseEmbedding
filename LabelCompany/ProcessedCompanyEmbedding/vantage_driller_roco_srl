procedure the “bankruptcy rules” and rule – of the local rules of bankruptcy practice and procedure of the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “local rules” the debtors request entry of an order directing consolidation of their chapter  cases for procedural purposes only  a proposed form of order granting the relief requested herein is annexed hereto as exhibit a the “proposed order” jurisdiction  this court has jurisdiction to consider this matter pursuant to  usc §§  and  and the amended standing order of reference from the united states district court for the district of delaware dated february   this is a core proceeding pursuant to  usc § b and pursuant to local rule –f the debtors consent to the entry of a final order by the court in connection with this motion to the extent that it is later determined that the court absent consent of the parties cannot enter final orders or judgments consistent with article iii of the united states constitution venue is proper before this court pursuant to  usc §§  and  rlf v  case bls doc  filed  page  of  background  on the date hereof the “petition date” each of the debtors commenced with this court a voluntary case under chapter  of title  of the united states code the “bankruptcy code” the debtors continue to operate their businesses and manage their properties as debtors in possession pursuant to sections a and  of the bankruptcy code no trustee examiner or statutory committee of creditors has been appointed in these chapter  cases  prior to the petition date the debtors began the solicitation of votes on their joint prepackaged chapter  plan of offshore group investment limited and its affiliated debtors the “prepackaged plan” through their disclosure statement for joint chapter  plan of offshore group investment limited and its affiliated debtors pursuant to sections  and b of the bankruptcy code the debtors expect that the prepackaged plan will be accepted by all classes entitled to vote in excess of the statutory thresholds specified in section c of the bankruptcy code  additional information regarding the circumstances leading to the commencement of these chapter  cases and information regarding the debtors’ business and capital structure is set forth in the declaration of christopher g declaire in support of the debtors’ chapter  petitions and related requests for relief the “declaire declaration” which has been filed contemporaneously herewith basis for relief requested  bankruptcy rule b provides in relevant part that “if    two or more petitions are pending in the same court by or against    a debtor and an affiliate the court may order a joint administration of the estates” fed r bankr p b section  of the bankruptcy code defines the term “affiliate” to mean rlf v  case bls doc  filed  page  of  a an entity that directly or indirectly owns controls or holds with power to vote  percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of the debtor other than an entity that holds such securities— i in a fiduciary or agency capacity without sole discretionary power to vote such securities or ii solely to secure a debt if such entity has not in fact exercised such power to vote b a corporation  percent or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned controlled or held with power to vote by the debtor or by an entity that directly or indirectly owns controls or holds with power to vote  percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of the debtor other than an entity that holds such securities— i in a fiduciary or agency capacity without sole discretionary power to vote such securities or ii solely to secure a debt if such entity has not in fact exercised such power to vote      usc §  the debtors are affiliates of one another because vantage drilling company a nondebtor owns or controls either directly or indirectly  of the outstanding voting securities of each of the debtors except pt vantage drilling company indonesia of which vantage drilling company indirectly owns  of the outstanding voting securities accordingly this court is authorized to jointly administer these cases for procedural purposes  in addition local rule – provides in relevant part as follows an order of joint administration may be entered without notice and an opportunity for hearing upon joint administration    supported by an affidavit declaration or verification which establishes that the joint administration of two or more cases pending in this court under title  is warranted and will ease the administrative burden for the court and the parties the filing of a motion for pursuant to local rule – the debtors have filed the declaire declaration contemporaneously herewith the declaire declaration establishes that the joint administration rlf v  case bls doc  filed  page  of  of the debtors’ respective estates is warranted and will ease the administrative burden for the court and parties in interest  joint administration of these cases will save the debtors and their estates substantial time and expense because it will remove the need to prepare replicate file and serve duplicative notices applications and orders further joint administration will relieve the court of entering duplicative orders and maintaining duplicative files and dockets the united states trustee for the district of delaware the “us trustee” and other parties in interest will similarly benefit from joint administration of these chapter  cases sparing them the time and effort of reviewing duplicative pleadings and papers  joint administration will not adversely affect creditors’ rights because this motion requests only the administrative consolidation of the estates and does not seek substantive consolidation as such each creditor will continue to hold its claim against a particular debtor’s estate after this motion is approved  as is demonstrated by the corporate structure chart attached to the declaire declaration as exhibit  thereto most of the debtors are direct or indirect subsidiaries of debtor offshore group investment limited “ogil” and the debtors that are not currently subsidiaries of ogil are expected to become subsidiaries of ogil on the effective date of the prepackaged plan accordingly the debtors respectfully request that each of the debtors’ chapter
