for reporting this comment undo l m well this is interesting at least to me it appears a hedge fund or private money acquired sun products and operated it after being sold off by unilever before that it was formerly huish  lever brothers i do truly wonder though if henkel will screw up the brands or mess with things they now have access to a ton of formulations and factorys associated with sun i guess we can only wonder  like    bookmark     august   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo sashanikki that is interesting sun makes a lot of detergents including i think costco detergent and all i always get a little concerned when a lot of items are made by just a few companies   likes    bookmark     august   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo georgect first off ummmi didnt know they were based in connecticut and so close by to where i live second what will this mean to the product lines all wisk snuggle sun surf and sunlight are they going to reformulate them i kind of dont like this   likes    bookmark     august   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo cubedweller hopefully henkel will take advantage of these new to them distribution channels i would love to see persil powder detergents in my local grocery  like    bookmark     august   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo beaglenc sunproducts didnt test on animals i hope the practice continues   likes    bookmark     august   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo littlegreeny george i have similar concerns sun products is a major player in the laundry aisle and they practically own the private label business they have some excellent brands mainly all and wisk and id hate to see them change those formulas i have a feeling they might discontinue some lines wisk surf to simplify their business and reduce overhead   likes    bookmark     august   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo l m sashanikki they practically make every single private label product costco target walmart sams club are just some of the ones that are on the top of my head georgect thats why i posted the hedge fund  private money has for the most part left everything intact and actually improved a few formulas ive been disappointed by lack of ability for a few things they make but i wonder if henkel will come in and ruin everything  you know for years all  some other brands were kinda in a downhill mode and were not heavily advertised now the brand is pretty recognizable and loved i wonder if that will all change   likes    bookmark     august   at pm thank
