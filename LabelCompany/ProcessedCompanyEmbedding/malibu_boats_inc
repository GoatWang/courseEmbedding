right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a

release includes the following financial measures defined as nongaap financial measures by the sec adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted fully distributed net income these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net income as determined in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of our liquidity certain items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets our presentation of these nongaap financial measures should also not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our computations of these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation amortization and noncash nonrecurring or nonoperating expenses including certain professional fees acquisition and integration related expenses noncash compensation expense and certain product development costs we define adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted ebitda divided by net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of net income as determined by gaap management believes adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are useful because they allow management to evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods capital structure and nonrecurring or nonoperating expenses we exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at adjusted ebitda because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures the methods

springer chief executive officer stated malibu had a very good quarter with all of our key metrics units revenue gross profit net income and adjusted ebitda performing above expectations and prior year while we continue to face international demand challenges our business in the united states continues to be strong and factors here indicate that strength is expected to continue for the foreseeable future malibus new product continues to be a critical driver of our success our new boats drive the market generating demand while our new features and innovations have made us the market leader together these factors will allow us to further separate ourselves from our competition mr springer continued we still believe that international demand will be a challenge due to the strength of the us dollar among other reasons and do not expect to see relief in the near term we believe demand in international markets will probably be flat for fiscal  when compared to the prior year while domestic markets remain strong and continue to grow this should be propelled by our strong product the strength of our distribution network the effects of continued precipitation in the western us and

for our new models such as the malibu wakesetter  and  mxz net sales per unit increased  to  per unit for the three months ended december   compared to the three months ended december   primarily driven by a mix shift to malibu including our newer models which carry a higher average selling price than our axis brand year over year price increases and lower discount activity offset by increased rebate expense associated with our new rebate program for model year  cost of sales for the three months ended december   increased  million or  to  million as compared to the three months ended

expenses for the three months ended december   as a percentage of sales selling and marketing expenses decreased  basis points to  over the same period general and administrative expenses for the three months ended december   decreased  million or  to  million as compared to the three months ended december   largely due to a decrease in the marine power litigation judgment following our appeal

for current and prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such and should only be viewed as historical data use and definition of nongaap financial measures this release includes the following financial measures defined as nongaap financial measures by the sec adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted fully distributed net income these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net income as determined in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of our liquidity certain items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing a companys financial performance such as a companys cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets our presentation of these nongaap financial measures should also not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our computations of these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation amortization and noncash nonrecurring or nonoperating expenses including certain professional fees acquisition and integration related expenses noncash compensation expense and certain product development costs we define adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted ebitda divided by net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of net income as determined by gaap management believes adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are useful because they allow management to evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods capital structure and nonrecurring or nonoperating expenses we exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at adjusted ebitda because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book
