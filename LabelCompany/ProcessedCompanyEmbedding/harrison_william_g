was successful and many more were built along the great lakes especially the southern shore of lake erie to unload steamers full of taconite from the iron mines near lake superior until 0 they were built by webster camp  lane company of akron ohio substantial improvements were later made on the design by samuel t wellman it is these secondgeneration huletts which continue to stand to this day
