uses see furness disambiguation low furness redirects here for the primary school of the same name see low furness ce primary school furness ˈfɜːrnəs furnəs is an area of cumbria in northwestern england together with cartmel it forms north lonsdale which was historically an exclave of lancashire the region may be split into two areas low furness and high furness the former consists of the headland bounded on west by the duddon estuary and on the east by morecambe bay while the latter extends inland into the lake district and contains the furness fells off the southern tip of low furness is walney island eighteen kilometers in length as well as several smaller islands the town of barrow which developed as furnesss iron industry flourished in the th century dominates the region the surrounding borough contains three quarters of the total population of  other significant settlements are ulverston dalton coniston broughton and askam  ireleth contents  etymology  geography  history  administration  employment  gallery  references etymologyedit the name which is first recorded in  as fuththernessa is interpreted as headland by the rumpshaped island from old norse futh genitive futhar meaning rump and nes meaning headland the island in question may be piel island with the name originally referring to the headland immediately opposite where rampside is before being extended to the entire region alternatively it could be walney island though it little resembles a rump today erosion could have altered its shape over time geographyedit view from the slopes of dow crag in the coniston fells furnesss border follows the river duddon up to wrynose pass and then the brathay until it flows into windermere the mere forms most of the eastern boundary with the rest being made up of the leven from its source at windermeres southern tip to its mouth at morecombe bay in total furness has an area of about  square kilometers the furness fells are formed of ordovician volcanic rocks and silurian shales and slates to the south they are cut through by windermere coniston water and numerous valleys which drain into the esk the duddon and morecambe bay the higher ground is rocky heathland with frequent tarns while the lower ground supports pasture and woodland in the east there are two main chains of hills one overlooking windermere with latterbarrow m as its highest point and the other which reaches m overlooking coniston water between them is flat country and esthwaite water west of coniston water is the highest range the coniston fells with the coniston old man m as its highest point and historically the highest point in lancashire a lesser range extends from torver to just north of dalton but south of that the landscape is flat this area is also called plain furness the low rolling hills of low furness are formed of glacial deposits mainly boulder clay above triassic sandstone and carboniferous limestone there are large deposits of iron ore here of very pure quality historyedit the ruins of furness abbey just north of barrow furness seems to have been scantly populated in ancient times a handful of brittonic placenames survive around barrow suggesting this part was settled earliest anglosaxons arrived in low furness in the th century but do not seem to have spread to high furness which remained almost empty until it was populated by incoming scandinavians in the th century it has been suggested that they had a small mountain kingdom there centered on coniston which means kings town the prevalence of names with the element thwaite in high furness from norse thveit clearing and the absence thereof in low furness suggests that the latter had already been deforested by the time the scandinavians arrived scandinavians probably formed the majority of the furness population and old norse remained a living language in the region until at least the late th century before the conquest furness assessed to contain  ploughlands was part of the manor of hougun held by tostig earl of northumbria by  furness was in the possession of the crown in  prince stephen founded furness abbey granting the abbot most of the land in furness and giving the rest to a fleming named michael henry iii later granted the rent due from the lord of michaels land £ per year to the abbot of furness making him the sole tenantinchief and thus one of the most powerful abbots in the country in the th century dalton castle and piel castle were built by the abbots of furness to defend the market town of dalton and the port of barrow respectively the area had been raided by scots in  and again in  though in the latter year the abbot paid robert the bruce a ransom to stop his men harrying low furness the pretender lambert simnel landed with his army at piel island in  a few locals joined him including sir thomas broughton of broughton tower who would be killed at the disastrous battle of stoke field the abbey was closed in  after the monks lent their support to the pilgrimage of grace and the abbots lands were seized by the crown becoming part of the royal duchy of lancaster later they were granted to the dukes of
