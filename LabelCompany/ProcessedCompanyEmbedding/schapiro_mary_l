release statement of sec chairman mary l schapiro on money market fund reform for immediate release  washington dc aug  — securities and exchange commission chairman mary schapiro today made the following statement three commissioners constituting a majority of the commission have informed me that they will not support a staff proposal to reform the structure of money market funds the proposed structural reforms were intended to reduce their susceptibility to runs protect retail investors and lessen the need for future taxpayer bailouts i  together with many other regulators and commentators from both political parties and various political philosophies  consider the structural reform of money markets one of the pieces of unfinished business from the financial crisis while as commissioners we each have our own views about the need to bolster money market funds a proposal would have given the public the chance to weigh in with their views as well however because three commissioners have now stated that they will not support the proposal and that it therefore cannot be published for public comment there is no longer a need to formally call the matter to a vote at a public commission meeting some commissioners have instead suggested a concept release we have been engaging for two and a half years on structural reform of money market funds a concept release at this point does not advance the discussion the public needs concrete proposals to react to the declaration by the three commissioners that they will not vote to propose reform now provides the needed clarity for other policymakers as they consider ways to address the systemic risks posed by money market funds i urge them to act with the same determination that the staff of the sec has displayed over the past two years as we consider money market funds susceptibility to runs we must remember the lessons of the financial crisis and the history of money market funds and we must be cognizant that the tools that were used to stop the run on money market funds in  no longer exist that is there is no backup plan in place if we experience another run on money market funds because money market funds effectively are operating without a net one of the most critical lessons from the financial crisis is that when regulators identify a potential systemic risk  or an industry or institution that potentially could require a taxpayer bailout  we must speak up it is our duty to foster a public debate and to pursue appropriate reforms i believe that is why financial regulators both past and present both democrats and republicans have spoken out in favor of structural reform of money market funds i also believe that is why independent observers such as academics and the financial press  from a variety of philosophical ideologies  have supported structural reform of money market funds as well the issue is too important to investors to our economy and to taxpayers to put our head in the sand and wish it away money market funds susceptibility to runs needs to be addressed other policymakers now have clarity that the sec will not act to issue a money market fund reform proposal and can take this into account in deciding what steps should be taken to address this issue history and background its been a long and deliberative process that led us to the point we are at today money market funds as we know them actually are not permitted under existing federal securities statutes instead they exist as a result of a special exemption granted by the sec three decades ago this exemptive rule known as rule a allows money market funds to seek to maintain a stable  net asset value by using penny rounding and amortized cost accounting as a result of this exemption these funds do not have to comply with the marktomarket valuation standards required for all other mutual funds in exchange money market funds relying on rule a must follow strict limitations on their investments over the years money market funds fostered a strong sense of stability as they maintained a stable  nav before long retail investors were using them as substitutes for checking accounts  and institutional investors were using them as vehicles for their cash management between  and  only one small money market fund fell far enough below the  nav that it broke the buck but because of its size the impact from that event did not spread to other money market funds or the broader market during that period however numerous sponsors of money market funds supported the funds stable  navs by purchasing out troubled securities at abovemarket values injecting cash infusions into the funds and otherwise engaging in capital support of their money market funds unfortunately the sense of stability this created led to what i believe to be a false sense of security masking risks that became all too apparent during the financial crisis when the reserve primary fund broke the buck in the fall of  this stability was shattered in a matter of days panicked investors had redeemed not only massive amounts from the reserve fund but more than  billion from prime money market funds across the industry the short term credit markets froze and financial institutions and operating companies worldwide were unable to effectively fund their daily operations to stop the growing damage the treasury department stepped in by temporarily guaranteeing investments in money market funds this was an unprecedented action that put taxpayers on the hook for the performance of an investment product the temporary federal guarantee was supplemented by federal reserve board liquidity facilities which also provided unprecedented assistance to money market funds in short every taxpayer in the nation found themselves a partial insurer of a multitrillion investment product money market funds structural issues while the events of the  financial crisis dramatically exposed the risks presented by money market funds it also highlighted that the risks stem from flaws inherent in the structure of money market funds in particular most of the risks resulted from the valuation standards and stable nav that are permitted to exist by sec rule without any capital or asset cushion to back them up first money market funds have no ability to absorb a loss above a certain size without breaking the buck we saw that first hand with the reserve primary fund where just over  of that funds assets were held in commercial paper of lehman brothers when lehman brothers declared bankruptcy its commercial paper became worthless the fund broke the buck investors began to flee the fund and other funds began to experience high rates of redemptions as a result   second investors of money market funds have every incentive to run at the first sign of a problem we saw this phenomenon play out in the week of september   when over  billion was withdrawn from prime money market funds under the firstmover advantage those who redeem first get out with their full  invested even if the funds assets are worth slightly less this leaves all the other investors holding the bag usually the slower moving retail investors who can lose both value and access to their money they lose the value when the fund reaches a marktomarket nav of andahalf cents and breaks the buck and they lose access for an unknown period since fund boards are now permitted to suspend redemptions and liquidate a fund if it breaks the buck this inability to absorb a loss in value of a portfolio security and the incentive to run at the first sign of a problem are the two structural issues we were seeking to address with the proposals under consideration by the commission these are issues that are inherent in the structure of money market funds which came to the fore in the financial crisis but undoubtedly are still present the fear of breaking the buck and triggering a run is perhaps one reason why fund managers in hundreds of instances have sought some type of relief to bolster their funds financial condition and prevent the breaking of a buck several entities  from moodys to the federal reserve to our own staff  have spelled out this fact indeed based on our staffs tabulation there have been more than  such instances dating back to the s this figure represents those occasions where fund sponsors requested relief or otherwise notified us that they provided sponsor capital support to their funds because of a troubled security holding or a need to address diminished value or extraordinary redemptions in a money market fund as we all know though and as was evident in the reserve primary fund case there is no legal obligation for a funds sponsor to support its fund and there is absolutely no certainty that every fund sponsor with a problem in its money market fund will be able to provide capital support to the fund reform alternatives that is why we were considering alternative proposals that would address these two structural issues in different ways the two alternatives first that money market funds float the nav and use marktomarket valuation like every other mutual fund this would underscore for investors that money market funds are investment products and that any expectation of a guarantee is unwarranted in such a scenario investment losses in money market fund portfolios could be both absorbed and reflected in the price  as would gains for that matter similarly while the incentive to run may not be reduced entirely the cliff effect of redeeming at  or getting stuck with a loss and no immediate access to ones assets would no longer exist  second and alternatively a tailored capital buffer of less than  of fund assets adjusted to reflect the risk characteristics of the money market fund this capital buffer would be used to absorb the daytoday variations in the value of a money market funds holdings to supplement that capital buffer in times of stress it would be combined with a minimum balance at risk requirement that requirement would enable investors to redeem up to  of their assets in the normal course as they do today however it would require a day holdback of the final  of a shareholders investment in a money market fund that holdback would take a socalled firstloss position and could be used to provide extra capital to a money market fund that suffered losses greater than its capital buffer during that day period the result is that remaining investors would not be harmed by a redeeming investors full withdrawal and the incentive to redeem fully and quickly at the first sign of trouble would be diminished i believe these proposals have merit address the two structural issues identified and deserved to see the light of day so that we could receive public feedback the reform process development of these proposals was thorough and considered in june  shortly after the financial crisis and my arrival at the commission the commission proposed an important first round of reforms to boost the resilience of money market fund portfolios the commission adopted those reforms in january of  the reforms shortened maturities improved credit qualities and for the first time imposed liquidity requirements for money market funds the reforms were based in large part on the march  report of the icis money market fund working group this first round of reforms also imposed new disclosure requirements regarding money market fund portfolios and shadow navs those disclosures have been very valuable to both the sec and to investors as we monitor money market fund portfolios but when the commission proposed the first stage of money market fund reforms in  it also requested comment on additional structural reforms namely whether to mandate a floating nav and whether to require redemptions in kind in other words the commission made clear that the first round of reforms in  were a first step and that additional structural reforms were expected to follow as a second step in fact i specifically said as much at the time thereafter in november  the commission requested comment on structural reform options discussed in the money market fund report issued by the presidents working group  a precursor to the financial stability oversight council after reviewing those comments the sec hosted a may  roundtable on money market funds and systemic risk the roundtable included voting members from fsoc or their designee as well as fund industry representatives investors academics foreign regulators and industry observers following the roundtable our staff in consultation with staff from the treasury and the federal reserve met with various fund industry representatives to discuss multiple structural reform options and we received even more ideas worthy of pursuing and we continued to collect public comment throughout this long process once the staff narrowed money market reform options they refined those options obtained suggestions for additional areas of public comment and prepared a proposal that is shaped and strengthened by economic analysis the draft release presented to the commissioners requests comment on multiple alternative approaches to money market fund reform including liquidity fees and gates  all with a view of furthering the public debate  stay connected

sec chairman the consumer in the financial services revolution by chairman mary l schapiro us securities and exchange commission consumer federation of america st annual financial services conference washington dc december   thank you very much for that kind introduction i am so pleased to be here today the consumer federation of america has long been a vigorous watchdog for consumers everywhere every time that i step inside a store open a bank account buy insurance or set up a telephone plan — i know that im benefiting from the work of the cfa and the same can be said every time any of us invests in a financial product or turns to an investment professional for help that is why i so greatly appreciate the work of this organization today we are undergoing a financial services revolution and i know that both of our organizations will continue to be on the front lines looking out for individual investors — finding ways to better protect americans who contribute to a k plan open a college investment account or simply buy a single stock bond or mutual fund as we all know last years financial turmoil had a real impact on real people many older americans had to put off their retirements many families with high school students saw their college investment plans plummet many workers came to work to find a pink slip on their desk and many middleaged americans saw their future financial security replaced with uncertainty in recent months the market has improved and the financial forecasters have become more optimistic but we cannot let down our guard we cannot presume the weaknesses in our financial regulatory system have been resolved and we cannot let our memories be so short as to avoid learning lessons from the mistakes of the past there is too much at stake for this reason we must continue our efforts to reform the financial regulatory system — both at the congressional level and at the agency level both the administration and congress have recognized the need for meaningful and effective financial reforms — and have been working hard in recent months on legislation to achieve these goals we have certainly made progress but we still have a ways to go on the legislative front we need a regulatory system that is focused on identifying and minimizing systemic risk — one that can eliminate gaps in our regulatory structure protect investor rights and promote fair competition we need a credible resolution regime that permits large institutions to fail without taking the system or taxpayers down with them — a regime that eliminates artificial advantages and incentives that encourage institutions to get so big and complicated in the first place we need to bring managers of hedge funds and other private funds under the regulatory umbrella for too long these large players have managed to avoid effective oversight we need to have a strong fiduciary standard for all securities professionals and finally we need to bring greater transparency and stability to the over the counter derivatives market — a market that has grown enormously in the past decade this is particularly important because derivatives directly affect the regulated securities and futures markets and can infuse significant risk into our financial system they serve as a less regulated — but economically equivalent — alternative to the markets and products that you and i rely upon to address these gaps and regulatory arbitrage dangers legislation is essential to bring greater transparency and oversight to otc derivative products and market participants the existing regulatory chasm cannot be allowed to continue i believe congress has made real progress in this regard as this process moves forward however we must remain ever vigilant against even small exceptions carve outs and arbitrage opportunities that might create tomorrows risks for example to prevent bad actors from hiding their trading activities i also believe we — at the sec — need the tools to effectively apply the securities laws and police the securitiesbased derivatives market that is why we have been pushing for securitybased swaps to be subject to at least all the oversight and transparency that would apply to any other overthecounter security such as an otc option this would ensure that we have the ability to inspect and examine all relevant market participants — including swap dealers central counterparties trading venues and swap repositories we need to have quick access to comprehensive realtime data on securitiesrelated otc derivatives — so that fraudsters cannot just use securitiesbased derivatives to engage in insider trading or market manipulation regulatory activity but the need for meaningful regulatory reform does not exist solely at the congressional level it is not limited to macroeconomic issues there is much that the sec can do on its own in fact over the past year we have already undertaken initiatives to protect client assets at investment advisers address market structure inequities enhance corporate governance strengthen the resiliency of money market funds and upgrade regulation of credit rating agencies protecting the individual investor all of these initiatives — and many more — will ultimately help individual investors and it is to that constituency i believe the sec must be most attuned after all brokerdealers and investment advisers put lots of thought and energy into selling their products and services to the public they figure out how they can get new investors in the door and how they can make a profit so i want to be sure that we — at the sec — are putting just as much thought and energy into how to protect individuals who are entrusting their money to our capital markets i want to know that weve thought through what investors encounter when they walk into a financial professionals office or call them on the phone for example does the investor make a distinction between brokers and investment advisers the way the law does does the investor get the relevant simple and comparable information at the point of sale or recommendation or only after the sale has occurred if at all does the investor know about all the fees they are being charged and whether they are getting the services they are being charged for and does the investor appreciate the nuances of retirement investments and products today i want to discuss the initiatives we are undertaking to address these questions — and perhaps its easiest to do so from the perspective of that individual investor treating securities professionals similarly applying the same standards so imagine an investor walking down main street in the town where you grew up he steps into the office of the local securities professional and is handed a business card but he doesnt look to see whether it says brokerdealer or investment adviser chances are he doesnt know the difference or even care all he wants is helpful investorfocused advice a fair deal and a professional he can trust these seem to me to be reasonable expectations but today that investor — whether he knows it or not — is treated differently depending on what that business card says if its a brokerdealer hes sold a product that is suitable for him if its an investment adviser he gets treated under a higher standard — the fiduciary duty standard — meaning that the investment adviser has to provide advice that puts the investors interest first investors today should not be treated differently based on what door they walk into — or based on what is written on the business card they are handed instead i believe that all securities professionals should be subject to the same fiduciary duty — and that all investors receiving advice should rest assured that the advice they get is being given with their interest at heart but to be effective the fiduciary duty needs to be meaningful and uniform across all securities professionals it cannot be weakened or diluted just so that it can be applied broadly at the same time we should not assume that the investor is fully protected just because the professional on the other side of the desk is subject to a fiduciary standard to fully protect the interests of that investor we must couple the fiduciary duty with an effective oversight regime and because that investor doesnt differentiate between brokerdealers and investment advisers our rules should not either securities professionals regardless of what their business card says should be subject to the same standard of conduct the same licensing and qualification requirements the same disclosure obligations the same regulatory and recordkeeping standards and a robust examination and oversight schedule this approach may disrupt a number of entrenched interests but we are doing no service to retail investors by continuing with a distinctly different regulatory approach for professionals who perform virtually the same or similar services i thank congress and the administration for their leadership in moving us toward a unified fiduciary standard and a harmonized regulatory regime for brokerdealers and investment advisers securities professionals compensation and conflicts point of sale disclosure so now let us assume our investor is dealing with a professional who is subject to a fiduciary standard he puts the business card in his pocket and proceeds to listen to the advice he is given but exactly what information is he provided is it helpful is it easy to understand surely buying a security is not like buying cereal in the grocery store but when we enter a grocery store we at least can see nutrition labels that are easily comparable we can see prices that are clearly marked we can count calories and save cents as we walk through the aisles comparing products but back at that office of the financial professional comparative shopping is not so easy in my mind this should not be the case i believe retail investors should be provided clear simple meaningful disclosure at the time they are making an investment decision — disclosure that includes comprehensible and comparable information about the securities products and services being offered it also should include information about the compensation the professional will receive on each product being sold — and information about the conflicts that may be causing the advisor or salesman to steer the investor to a certain investment i realize this is a difficult task but we will not be deterred by the complexity of the product our staff already has announced that it is developing a simplified summary prospectus for variable annuities which are widely regarded as one of the most difficulttounderstand products on the market it is precisely in this type of product where simplicity of disclosure is essential at the end of the day our investor in that main street office just wants to know the facts so he is not taken advantage of by hidden fees or questionable motivations and he needs this information when it is most meaningful — at the time he is making his investment decision naturally not every securities product is purchased while sitting in an office on main street with technology it doesnt quite work that way anymore for this reason the mode of disclosure will need to be tailored a solely paperbased disclosure system is a thing of the past we should harness the power of the internet to better serve retail investors but because disclosure should inform and not overwhelm the goal of this disclosure initiative will be to achieve simplicity and clarity whether on the page or on the screen based on past experience i know that getting to the point where we can have meaningful point of sale disclosure will be difficult there will likely be significant pushback from the industry related to cost and convenience but anything worth doing is not easy ultimately if we can improve the timeliness and clarity of disclosure for that investor on main street it will have been well worth the effort b fees directly related to this is the issue of b fees these are fees that are automatically deducted from mutual funds to compensate securities professionals for sales and services provided to mutual fund investors the problem is that our investor may have no idea these fees are being deducted or who they are ultimately compensating thats why i believe there needs to be a better approach when it comes to these fees there is a need for more fundamental change than merely disclosure reforms and a name change we must critically rethink how b  fees are used and whether they continue to be appropriate for example do they result in investors overpaying for services or paying for distribution services that they may not even know they are supposed to be getting this is no small matter in  these fees amounted to more than  billion — up from just a few million dollars in  when they were first permitted of course in  they may have made sense — but after  years of growth and change in the mutual fund market it is past the time to reassess their need and their effectiveness so i have asked the staff for a recommendation on b fees for commission consideration in  retirement products finally as we look back in on the office on main street — we see our investor asking about retirement products in fact today thats happening more and more as americans are being asked to fund their own retirements that is why i believe our nation needs to commit to helping everyday americans invest for their retirements it is a financial goal that no one should ignore whether just entering the workforce or approaching the end of a career essential to this effort are education and financial literacy earlier this fall the sec launched a new investorgov web site to better connect with retail investors with a particular focus on seniors and we recently brought on a new management team to oversee investor education to assure an undiluted focus on the need to better educate investors in addition i have requested that the staff early next year present the commission its recommendations on target date funds as you may know these are products specifically designed for main street investors planning for their retirement they are funds that contain a target retirement date in their very name and are designed to become more conservatively invested as the target date approaches however last year many investors were surprised when target date funds marketed to  retirees lost between  and  percent of their values the set it and forget it slogans of these funds resulted in shocked investors who were on the verge of retirement it was a wakeup call for investors employers and regulators alike earlier this year the sec held a joint hearing with the department of labor which has designated target date funds as qualified default options for k retirement plans since that hearing our staff has been focused on the marketing materials related to these funds and the use of target dates in fund names i believe this an area in need of reform for the benefit of americas retirement investors and i look forward to completing the work we have started selffunding to succeed on behalf of all investors will take not only the will but the resources i can assure you we have the will we have dedicated men and women at the sec who wake up every day committed to protecting investors and we are stretching our existing resources but we will not likely be able to achieve all we seek to do without additional funding you may not know but the sec is a relatively small agency for what we are tasked to do we have a staff of  individuals responsible for overseeing more than  entities and areas as diverse as accounting market structure corporate governance mutual fund and intermediary regulation to name just a few and our examination staff — tasked with inspecting  investment advisory firms and  mutual funds — numbers less than  as a result our investor on main street has about a  chance of walking into an investment adviser who has been inspected by the sec in the previous year whats more as the financial world and product complexity were growing exponentially our budget was shrinking since  the sec staff size has dropped and funding for discretionary technology has decreased by  that is why i have been advocating for the sec to be able to fund its own operations like virtually every other financial regulator — through the fees we collect the amount of these fees far surpasses the amount appropriated by congress to the sec each fiscal year through selffunding the sec will be able to maintain sufficient stable longterm funding that would enable us to perform longterm planning and better protect the interests of investors and pursue the initiatives i have just described conclusion  will be another year in which i expect the sec to pursue an ambitious reform agenda and as we set out on these reforms we will do so from the perspective of that retail investor on main street who has the unquestioned right to believe that the sec is on the job i am committed to restoring confidence and providing the protections investors expect and deserve i hope i can count on your support thank you

set sign up invalid email address got it got it schapiro a longtime regulator took over as head of the agency in january  when the country was steeped in financial crisis the chief financial regulator worked to restore trust in the agency alex wonggetty images by dina elboghdady by dina elboghdady november   securities and exchange commission chairman mary l schapiro said monday that she will step down in middecember ending a fouryear tenure that began in the roughandtumble days of the financial crisis and came to be defined by it president obama designated elisse walter one of the sec’s democratic commissioners as schapiro’s replacement for now but people familiar with the administration’s plan expect the president to nominate a permanent successor soon the new sec chief will adopt an agency saved from the brink of extinction under schapiro’s watch when she took the job in january  the agency’s reputation was in tatters its failure to police wall street or detect bernard madoff’s massive ponzi scheme had critics calling for its dismantling even schapiro’s detractors credit her for making the agency relevant again under the most difficult conditions in its recent history but unfinished work presents knotty challenges critics say that under schapiro the sec never fully reckoned with the financial crisis or the shortcomings that created it it failed to punish key wall street figures negotiate enough meaningful settlements with the large institutions they ran or crank out most of the regulations required of it by the doddfrank overhaul measure enacted in  meanwhile the may  “flash crash” — in which highspeed computer trading accelerated a plunge in stock values — and other glitches such as the botched public offering of facebook are raising questions about whether the sec can keep up with the techsavvy traders and markets it oversees while some other countries are moving to rein in highspeed trading the sec has not schapiro dismissed the criticism and released several pages listing the sec’s achievements including an overhaul of the enforcement unit which brought a record number of actions in each of the past two years and has returned a record  billion to harmed investors since fiscal  the agency that was once on the chopping block has gained new authority from congress created a whistleblower program to gather tips and complaints and engaged in one of the most active periods of rulemaking in decades schapiro said “i feel great about the last four years” she said in an interview “i knew the most important thing i could do was steer the agency out of the most difficult period in its history and i feel i’ve accomplished that” obama lauded her record noting in a statement that schapiro “was fully aware of the difficulties facing the sec and our economy as a whole but she accepted the challenge and today the sec is stronger and our financial system is safer and better able to serve the american people — thanks in large part to mary’s hard work” even one of the sec’s most strident critics credited schapiro for turning around the agency harry markopolos the financial sleuth who had tried for years to alert the sec to madoff’s ponzi scheme said he initially opposed her nomination because she once ran the brokerage industry’s selfregulatory body and he took her for an industry sympathizer “i was quickly proven wrong” he said “the sec is nightandday better than it was four short years ago    it gives no free passes to anybody” many schapiro supporters say the watershed case that showed the sec was back in action came in april  when goldman sachs agreed to pay  million to settle a fraud suit brought by the agency — the largest fine the agency had ever assessed against a financial company other cases followed against companies involved in the financial crisis including countrywide bank of america and citigroup but the courts also dealt the sec some of its biggest setbacks late last year a federal judge in manhattan rejected an sec plan to settle its lawsuit against citigroup in one of the biggest cases to emerge from the mortgage meltdown saying the deal was too weak and failed to hold the bank accountable for wrongdoing more recently critics of the doddfrank act mounted a legal challenge that torpedoed an sec rule designed to make it easier for major shareholders to remove corporate board members and nominate new ones that decision had a chilling effect on the pace of sec regulation many of schapiro’s critics say she let the industry steamroll over her agency “she is not someone who relishes conflict” said barbara roper a director at the consumer federation of america “that is a very fine personal quality but it is not necessarily the quality we need in the leader of the sec in this environment” the battles in the courts partisanstruggles on the fivemember commission and pushback from house republicans on the doddfrank rule called for someone more thickskinned and combative her critics said and those critics are not sure they will get that leader in walter a close ally of schapiro’s who has served on the commission since july  the names of several other potential schapiro successors have surfaced including mary j miller a senior treasury department official rumors of schapiro’s departure had circulated for months and many expected her to step down after the presidential election the pressures of the job had exhausted her people who know her said during thanksgiving break surrounded by family she decided the timing of her departure she said “i have no plans at all” she said “i haven’t had time to think about what i want to do next” but if walter wants the top job she would have to be renominated and reconfirmed before her term expires in december  without schapiro the remaining four members on the commission will be evenly split between republicans and democrats creating the potential for gridlock like schapiro walter served at the selfregulatory body known as finra before joining the sec a lawyer by training she was the general counsel of the commodity futures trading commission in  and held various positions at the sec before she was confirmed as commissioner bartlett naylor a financial policy advocate at congress watch describes walter as a schapiro clone who voted with the chairman on nearly every policy decision walter declined to comment on her future plans on the commission but she praised schapiro as an unflappable protector of investors who has handled the pressures of the job with grace “i only hope that i will be able to do as well and if i can it will be because of all the work she’s done in the past four years” walter said business economy false afterth true please provide a valid email address sign up

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in

thing for us markets and us investors mary schapiro do the right thing go i came in with the intention of serving as long as it made sense for me to do so the election was a natural moment to think about whether i wanted to stay longer and im thrilled to turn the reins over to my longtime colleague elisse walter mary schapiro moment long me there are no absolutes in this world and there will always be mistakes that are made within brokerage firms there will always be people who set out to deceive the regulators and even deceive their own senior management mary schapiro mistakes management world it has been an incredibly rewarding experience to work with so many dedicated sec staff who strive every day to protect investors and ensure our markets operate with integrity mary schapiro work integrity experience when the sec needs to be deterring corporate wrongdoing the penalty pilot program sends the wrong message mary schapiro pilot wrong needs too often investors are the target of fraudulent schemes disguised as investment opportunities as you know if the balance is tipped to the point where investors are not confident that there are appropriate protections investors will lose confidence in our markets and capital formation will ultimately be made more difficult and expensive mary schapiro confidence balance know in my case theres no revolving door i wont be going back to government mary schapiro door government back i work on weekends but from home mary schapiro work home weekends the sec got more than  rules to write under doddfrank the lions share of all the

rules that give shareholders the ability to vote on executive compensation we have new rules for assetbacked securities we have new rules around credit rating agencies mary schapiro rules credit new
