principles we strive to provide institutional and highnetworth investors with returns in excess of the benchmark over the long term while past performance is no guarantee the approach we use has delivered competitive absolute and relative performance returns over longer periods of timeour firm recognizes the importance of every one of our distinguished institutional and highnetworth clients and we strive to provide the highest level of products and service at all timesbrandes is defined and differentiated by three strong ”pillars”  committee approach to investment decisions  graham  dodd philosophy  independence for the firm committee approach to investment decisions instead of individual fund managers carefully chosen teams apply our disciplined process across all products clients benefit from the breadth and depth of knowledge of senior executives and investment professionals working together for a common goal rather than competing for personal recognition specific procedures guard against “groupthink” and minimize vulnerability to personnel departures graham  dodd philosophy our investment principles have remained unchanged since charles brandes founded the firm in  a large team of research analysts scours the globe to identify companies that can be purchased at a discount to our estimate of their true intrinsic value the researchers’ findings are then presented to an investment committee for careful scrutiny and ultimately consensus on potential longterm outperformance as benjamin graham stated beating the benchmarks demands portfolios that look different than the benchmarks therefore we are completely willing to bear little resemblance to the indices as a consequence of our approach rather than by design our portfolios typically have conservative fundamental characteristics such as low pricetoearnings ratio low pricetobook value low pricetocash flow and higher than average dividend yield independence for the firm onehundredpercent owned by senior brandes personnel we are free to focus solely on our clients’ best interests independence also enables us to make the kind of longterm decisions that have kept our firm debtfree profitable and wellresourced particularly during turbulent economic environments our commitment to retaining key personnel ensures both a high level of staff expertise and the continuity and integrity of our process

have a simplified prospectus and annual information form prepared in accordance with ni  and securities of each top fund are or will be qualified for distribution in the jurisdictions              each top fund is or will be a reporting issuer under the securities legislation of one or more jurisdictions              none of the existing top funds is in default of securities legislation in any of the jurisdictions              the investment objective of morningstar aggressive portfolio is to achieve longterm capital appreciation by investing primarily in a diverse mix of other mutual funds and exchange traded funds that invest in canadian and global equity securities with limited exposure to fixed income securities           the investment objective of morningstar balanced portfolio is to achieve a combination of longterm capital appreciation and income by investing primarily in a diverse mix of mutual funds and exchange traded funds that invest in canadian and global fixedincome and equity securities           the investment objective of morningstar conservative portfolio is to preserve value and achieve modest longterm capital appreciation and income by investing primarily in a diverse mix of other mutual funds and exchange traded funds that invest in canadian and global fixedincome and equity securities           the investment objective of morningstar growth portfolio is to achieve longterm capital appreciation by investing primarily in a diverse mix of other mutual funds and exchange traded funds that invest in canadian and global equity and fixed income securities           the investment objective of morningstar moderate portfolio is to preserve value and achieve a mix of longterm capital appreciation and income by investing primarily in a diverse mix of other mutual funds and exchange traded funds that invest in canadian and global fixedincome and equity securities           the investment objectives and strategies of the initial top funds and of any other top fund will allow the top funds to obtain exposure on some or more of their assets to securities of other mutual funds           subject to compliance with ni  the investment objectives and strategies of each top fund would permit the top fund to invest in units of the underlying pooled funds the underlying pooled funds           the underlying pooled funds are each a “mutual fund” as such term is defined under the act formed as a trust under the laws of ontario pursuant to a declaration of trust           the underlying pooled funds are not subject to ni  and have not prepared a simplified prospectus or annual information form in accordance with ni            the underlying pooled funds are not reporting issuers in any of the jurisdictions           units of the underlying pooled funds are available for purchase only by investors who qualify to invest in the underlying pooled funds pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus requirement such as those that meet the definition of an “accredited investor” as set forth in national instrument  prospectus exemptions andor the act including by mutual funds managed by the filer           the investment objective of galibier canadian equity pool is to achieve longterm capital appreciation through investments primarily in canadian equity securities           the investment objective of invesco select emerging markets equity pool is to achieve capital growth over the long term by investing substantially all of its assets in equity securities of companies located in emerging market countries and frontier markets           while not subject to ni  as of the date of this decision the investment strategies and restrictions of the underlying pooled funds are consistent with ni  the filer has compliance processes in place to ensure each underlying pooled fund is managed in accordance with ni  as if it were applicable investments in galibier canadian equity pool           an investment by the top funds in galibier canadian equity pool will be compatible with the investment objectives and strategies of those top funds that desire exposure to canadian equities           the filer submits that the most economicallyefficient and strategic way to obtain the desired exposure to a canadian equity mandate is to invest in a fund that is focused exclusively on canadian equities allowing the top funds to invest in units of galibier canadian equity pool will also allow them to leverage the expertise research and investment style of the portfolio manager of galibier canadian equity pool           while it may be possible for the filer to gain exposure to canadian equities by investing in other mandates the filer believes it is in the best interests of the top funds to have the ability to invest in galibier canadian equity pool           the filer has determined that passive exchange traded funds etfs generally do a suboptimal job in replicating the returns of inefficient or specialized markets particularly small and midsized canadian equities moreover activelymanaged etfs are too costly an option for the top funds and the filer would need to dedicate additional resources to select from many different etfs in order to gain the same diversified exposure in the canadian market as it would obtain by investing in galibier canadian equity pool           the initial top funds are unable to invest directly in the individual underlying securities that galibier canadian equity pool is invested in as the investment objectives of the initial top funds limit them to primarily investing in other mutual funds investments in invesco select emerging markets equity pool           an investment by the top funds in invesco select emerging markets equity pool will be compatible with the investment objectives and strategies of those top funds that desire exposure to emerging market equities           the filer believes that an investment in invesco select emerging markets equity pool will provide an efficient and cost effective way for the top funds to achieve diversification and obtain exposure to the markets and asset classes in which invesco select emerging markets equity pool invests this is particularly important in emerging markets which may be less efficient due to legal regulatory trading exchanges and accounting systems that are typically less advanced than those in developed markets           while it may be possible for the filer to gain exposure to emerging markets equity securities by investing in other mandates the filer believes it is in the best interests of the top funds to have the ability to invest in invesco select emerging markets equity pool           the filer has determined that passive etfs generally do a suboptimal job

including swaps  decision treats cleared swaps similar to other cleared derivatives  national instrument  investment funds applicable legislative provisions national instrument  investment funds ss  and    november   in the matter of the securities legislation of ontario the jurisdiction and in the matter of the process for exemptive relief applications in multiple jurisdictions and in the matter of brandes investment partners  co the filer decision background the principal regulator in the jurisdiction has received an application from the filer for a decision under the securities legislation of the jurisdiction of the principal regulator the legislation pursuant to section  of national instrument  investment funds ni  exempting each existing bridgehouse fund as defined below and all current and future mutual funds managed by the filer that enter into swaps as defined below in the future each a future bridgehouse fund and together with the existing bridgehouse funds each a bridgehouse fund and collectively the bridgehouse funds i from the requirement in subsection  of ni  that a mutual fund must not purchase an option or a debtlike security or enter into a swap or a forward contract unless at the time of the transaction the option debtlike security swap or contract has a designated rating or the equivalent debt of the counterparty or of a person or company that has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of the counterparty in respect of the option debtlike security swap or contract has a designated rating ii from the limitation in subsection  of ni  that the marktomarket value of the exposure of a mutual fund under its specified derivatives positions with any one counterparty other than an acceptable clearing corporation or a clearing corporation that settles transactions made on a futures exchange listed in appendix a to ni  shall not exceed for a period of  days or more  percent of the net asset value of the mutual fund and iii from the requirement in subsection  of ni  to hold all portfolio assets of an investment fund under the custodianship of one custodian in order to permit each bridgehouse fund to deposit cash and other portfolio assets directly with a futures commission merchant as defined below and indirectly with a clearing corporation as defined below as margin in each case with respect to cleared swaps the requested relief under the process for exemptive relief applications in multiple jurisdictions for a passport application a the ontario securities commission is the principal regulator for this application and b the filer has provided notice that subsection  of multilateral instrument  passport system mi  is intended to be relied upon in each of the other provinces and territories of canada the other jurisdictions and collectively with ontario the jurisdictions interpretation terms defined in ni  national instrument  definitions and mi  have the same meaning if used in this decision unless otherwise defined capitalized terms used in this decision have the following meanings cftc means the us commodity futures trading commission clearing corporation means any clearing organization registered with the cftc or central counterparty authorized by esma as the case may be that in either case is also permitted to operate in the jurisdiction or the other jurisdiction as the case may be where the bridgehouse fund is located doddfrank act means the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act emir means the european market infrastructure regulation esma means the european securities and markets authority european economic area means all of the european union countries and also iceland liechtenstein and norway existing bridgehouse fund means each mutual fund managed by the filer that is relying on the previous relief on the date of this decision futures commission merchant means any futures commission merchant that is registered with the cftc andor clearing member for purposes of emir as applicable and is a member of a clearing corporation otc means overthecounter portfolio advisor means each of the filer each affiliate of the filer and each third party portfolio manager retained from time to time by the filer as portfolio subadvisor to manage all or a portion of the investment portfolio of one or more bridgehouse funds swaps means the swaps that are or will become subject to a clearing determination or a clearing obligation issued by the cftc or esma as the case may be including fixedtofloating interest rate swaps basis swaps forward rate

indices cdxnaig and cdxnahy and european indices itraxx europe itraxx europe crossover and itraxx europe hivol at various tenors us person has the meaning attributed thereto by the cftc representations this decision is based on the following facts represented by the filer the filer and the bridgehouse funds  the filer is or will be the investment fund manager of each bridgehouse fund the filer is registered as an investment fund manager a portfolio manager an exempt market dealer and a mutual fund dealer in each of the provinces of ontario and newfoundland and labrador the filer is also registered as a portfolio manager and an exempt market dealer in all of the other jurisdictions as a mutual fund dealer in all of the other jurisdictions except the province of québec and as an investment fund manager in the province of québec the head office of the filer is in toronto ontario  the filer is or will be the portfolio manager to the bridgehouse funds either an affiliate of the filer or a third party portfolio manager is or will be the portfolio subadvisor to some or all of the bridgehouse funds  each bridgehouse fund is or will be a mutual fund created under the laws of the province of ontario and is or will be subject to the provisions of ni   neither the filer nor the bridgehouse funds are in default of securities legislation in any jurisdiction  the securities of each bridgehouse fund are or will be qualified for distribution pursuant to a prospectus that was or will be prepared and filed in accordance with the securities legislation of the jurisdictions accordingly each bridgehouse fund is or will be a reporting issuer or the equivalent in each jurisdiction the previous cleared swaps relief  in a decision document dated december   the bridgehouse funds were granted relief from the requirements in subsections   and  to permit the bridgehouse funds to enter into cleared swaps that are or will be subject to a clearing determination issued by the cftc the previous relief  the previous relief in accordance with its terms terminates on december   accordingly the filer is seeking the requested relief on substantially the same terms as the previous relief except that the requested relief also permits the bridgehouse funds to enter into cleared swaps that become subject to a clearing obligation under emir cleared swaps  the investment strategies of each bridgehouse fund permit or will permit the bridgehouse fund to enter into derivative transactions including swaps each portfolio advisor for the existing bridgehouse funds considers swaps to be an important investment tool that is available to it to manage each bridgehouse funds portfolio  the doddfrank act requires that certain otc derivatives be cleared through a futures commission merchant at a clearing organization recognized by the cftc generally where one party to a swap is a us person that swap must be cleared  emir also requires that certain otc derivatives be cleared through a central counterparty authorized to provide clearing services for purposes of emir generally where one party to a swap is a financial counterparty or a nonfinancial counterparty whose otc derivative trading activity exceeds a certain threshold in each case established in a state that is a participant in the european economic area that swap will be required to be cleared the first clearing directive has been issued in respect of certain interest rate swaps and will be phasedin based on the category of both parties to the trade  in order to benefit from both the pricing benefits and reduced trading costs that a portfolio advisor may be able to achieve through its trade execution practices for its advised investment funds and other accounts and from the reduced costs associated with cleared otc derivatives as compared to other otc trades the filer wishes to have the bridgehouse funds enter into cleared swaps  in the absence of the requested relief each portfolio advisor will need to structure the swaps entered into by the bridgehouse funds so as to avoid the clearing requirements of the cftc and under emir as applicable the filer respectfully submits that this would not be in the best interests of the bridgehouse funds and their investors for a number of reasons as set out below  the filer strongly believes that it is in the best interests of the bridgehouse funds and their investors to continue to be able to execute otc derivatives with global counterparties including us and european swap dealers  in its role as a fiduciary for the bridgehouse funds the filer has determined that central clearing represents the best choice for the investors in the bridgehouse funds to mitigate the legal operational and back office risks faced by investors in the global swap markets  each portfolio advisor may use the same trade execution practices for all of its advised funds and other accounts including the bridgehouse funds an example of these trade execution practices is block trading where large number of securities are purchased or sold or large derivative trades are entered into on behalf of a number of investment funds and other accounts advised by one portfolio advisor these practices include the use of cleared swaps if the bridgehouse funds are unable to employ these trade execution practices then each affected portfolio advisor will have to create separate trade execution practices only for the bridgehouse funds and will have to execute trades for the bridgehouse funds on a separate basis this will increase the operational risk for the bridgehouse funds as separate execution procedures will need to be established and followed only for the bridgehouse funds in addition the bridgehouse funds will no longer be able to enjoy the possible price benefits and reduction in trading costs that a portfolio advisor may be able to achieve through a common practice for its advised funds and other accounts in the filers opinion best execution and maximum certainty can best be achieved through common trade execution practices which in the case of otc derivatives involve the execution of swaps on a cleared basis  as a member of the g and a participant in the september  commitment of g nations to improve transparency and mitigate risk in derivatives markets canada has expressly recognized the systemic benefits that clearing otc derivatives offers to market participants such as the bridgehouse funds the filer respectfully submits that the bridgehouse funds should be encouraged to comply with the robust clearing requirements established by the cftc and under emir by granting them the requested relief  the requested relief is analogous to the treatment currently afforded under ni  to other types of derivatives that are cleared such as clearing corporation options options on futures and standardized futures this demonstrates that from a policy perspective the requested relief is consistent with the views of the canadian securities authorities in respect of cleared derivative trades  for the reasons provided above the filer submits that it would not be prejudicial to the public interest to grant the requested relief decision the principal regulator is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the legislation for the principal regulator to make the decision the decision of the principal regulator under the legislation is that the requested relief is granted provided that when any rules applicable to customer clearing of otc derivatives enter into force the clearing corporation is permitted to offer customer clearing of otc derivatives in the jurisdiction or the other jurisdiction as the case may be where the bridgehouse fund is located and provided further that in respect of the deposit of cash and other portfolio assets as margin a in canada i the futures commission merchant is a member of a sro that is a participating member of cipf and ii the amount of margin deposited and maintained with the futures commission merchant does not when aggregated with the amount of margin already held by the futures commission merchant exceed  percent of the net asset value of the bridgehouse fund as at the time of deposit and b outside of canada i the futures commission merchant is a member of a clearing corporation and as a result is subject to a regulatory audit ii the futures commission merchant has a net worth determined from its most recent audited financial statements that have been made public or from other publicly available financial information in excess of the equivalent of  million and iii the amount of margin deposited and maintained with the futures commission merchant does not when aggregated with the amount of margin already held by the futures commission merchant exceed  percent of the net asset value of the bridgehouse fund as at the time of deposit this decision will terminate on the coming into force of any revisions to the provisions of ni  that address the clearing of otc derivatives raymond chan manager investment funds and structured products branch ontario securities commission javascript is disabled or not
