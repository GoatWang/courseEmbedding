former apprentice of noted vienna guitar craftsman johann stauffer moved his nascent guitarmaking company from germany to america setting up a small shop on hudson street in new york business chugged along for five years amid the hustle and bustle of the lower west side and in  martin and his wife relocated to the tranquil rolling hills of pennsylvania purchasing an eightacre tract just outside nazareth a tradition of master craftsmanship early martins were completely handcrafted guitars but by the s the company enjoyed sufficient sales to warrant a factory in  the company moved production from the martin homestead to their new north street plant in nazareth  a location that is still in use today by then several proprietary toneenhancing features had become standard such as the xbracing system for guitar tops  which is still used today for all steelstring martins when c f martin sr passed away in  he bequeathed to his family and the world a masterly guitarmaking tradition frank henry at the helm christian frederick jr ran martin for only  years until his untimely death in  when his yearold son frank henry took the helm young franks first challenge was the serious distribution issues the company was facing at the time under his bold leadership martin terminated its distribution agreement with zoebisch  sons and assumed distribution of its own products with the company placing ads in local newspapers and frank himself making sales calls to music dealers throughout new york state and new england the massive influx of italian immigrants in the s greatly boosted the market for a particular instrument of italian origin  the mandolin so martin started making mandolins alongside guitars and quickly ramped up production to meet the demand enter the dreadnought launched in  britains hms dreadnought was the first allbiggun battleship and the first to use steamturbine propulsion larger faster quieter and more deadly than any warship that had come before it ushered in the modern era of naval warfare in  martin christened their new largebodied acoustic guitars named after the groundbreaking naval vessel martins dreadnoughts were sold under the brand name oliver ditson  co the east coast music dealer whose general manager had a hand in the design until ditson went out of business in the late s roaring s depressed s in the s ukuleles became very popular and martin is estimated to have produced almost twice as many ukuleles as guitars business was booming  until the great depression struck in  instead of increased sales survival was the directive with the company halfheartedly branching out into areas such as violin parts and wood jewelry two lasting guitar innovations did come out of this dark period however martin invented the fret neck and refined the dreadnought concept defining the instrument as we know it today traditionally guitar necks had joined the body at the th fret the fret neck developed in late  increased the guitars range and versatility postwar prosperity and a new factory frank henry martin passed away in  and christian frederick iii assumed his fathers position as president postwwii prosperity and a growing american fascination with folk music and guitars created demand that outstripped martins production capacity by the early s martin customers were looking at backorders of up to three years the new sycamore street plant solved these problems and by  when frank herbert took the reins from his father martin was embarking upon a period of acquisition that included fibes drums and vega banjo works  which were subsequently spun off and the darco string company which remains an integral part of the company to this day todays martin christian frederick martin iv apprenticed at the company for several years before joining fulltime in  chris was appointed ceo and chairman of the board in  tasked with leading martin into the new millennium under his leadership the popular backpacker travel guitar was introduced and martins limitededition series was expanded with signature models of important artists such as eric clapton and gene autry participation in mtvs  successful unplugged program upped the visibility of the company and martins x series guitars took a fresh look at the way the guitar is constructed the company set forth its ecological policy in  and remains an industry leader in the use
