annuities overview what are annuities annuities can be used to help you increase your savings protect what youve saved or generate a stream of income have us call you annuities generally fall into two categories deferred and income each works differently and offers unique advantages taxdeferred annuities for retirement savings deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once youve made the maximum allowable contributions to your k or ira like any taxdeferred investment earnings compound over time providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack deferred annuities have no irs contribution limits so you can invest as much as you want for retirement you can also use your savings to create a guaranteed stream of income for retirement depending on how annuities are funded they may not have minimum required distributions mrds bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax and if taken before age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds which will affect your returns deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth however this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss while still participating in potential market growth deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed rate of return for a number of years fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility in this way they’re similar to certificates of deposit cds however deferred fixed annuities differ from cds in that annuities are not fdicinsured withdrawals from annuities prior to age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a cd annuity earnings compound on a taxdeferred basis income annuities for income in retirement income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed income for life or a set period of time they may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio since they provide a lifetime income stream keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed predictable payment for life or for a certain period of time your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility helping shield your retirement income from market risk a costofliving increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation deferred income annuities are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start because of the deferral period you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment the costofliving increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities to buy or learn more   find an investor center  each individuals situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested although variable annuities offer taxdeferral if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or ira you should do so for the variable annuitys features and benefits other than tax deferral in such cases tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity references throughout this material to tax advantages such as tax deferral and taxfree transfers are subject to this consideration  insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions  guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity

calculated by assuming that the income generated for that day period is generated each day period over a week period and is shown as a percentage of the investment the effective yield is calculated similarly but when annualized the income earned by an investment is assumed to be reinvested the effective yield will be slightly higher than the yield because of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment the yield of a subaccount besides the domestic money market subaccount refers to the annualized income generated by an investment in the subaccount over a specified day or one month period the yield is calculated by assuming the income generated by the investment during that day or onemonth period is generated each period over  months and is shown as a percentage of the

value the accumulation unit value for a subaccount varies daily with the performance and expenses of the corresponding fund we use this value to determine the number of subaccount accumulation units represented by your investment in a subaccount  how are my contract transactions priced we calculate an accumulation unit value for each subaccount at the close of business on each day that the new york stock exchange is open transactions are priced which means that accumulation units in your contract are purchased added to your contract or redeemed taken out of your contract at the unit value next calculated after our service center receives notice of the transaction for premium payments and transfers into a subaccount units are purchased for payment of contract proceeds ie withdrawals surrenders annuitization and death benefits transfers out of a subaccount and deductions for any contract fee any transfer charge and any premium taxes due units are redeemed   how do we determine the number of units we determine the number of units by dividing the dollar value of the amount of the purchase or transfer allocated to the subaccount by the value of one accumulation unit for that subaccount for the valuation period in which the purchase or transfer is made the number of accumulation units in each subaccount credited to a contract will therefore increase or decrease as these transactions are made the number of subaccount accumulation units credited to a contract will not change as a result of investment experience or the deduction of assetbased insurance charges instead this charge and investment experience are reflected in the accumulation unit value  when we first established each subaccount we arbitrarily set the value of an accumulation unit at  accumulation unit values increase decrease or stay the same from one valuation period to the next an accumulation unit value for any valuation period is determined by multiplying the accumulation unit value for the prior valuation period by the net investment factor for the subaccount for the current valuation period the net investment factor is an index used to measure the investment performance of a subaccount from one valuation period to the next for any subaccount we determine the net investment factor by dividing the value of the assets of the subaccount for that valuation period by the value of the assets of the subaccount for the preceding valuation period we subtract from that result the daily equivalent of the assetbased insurance charge for the valuation period we also take reinvestment of dividends and capital gains into account when we determine the net investment factor  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th we may adjust the net investment factor to make provisions for any

optional transfer program called dollar cost averaging dca this program allows you to reallocate money at monthly intervals from a designated subaccount to one or more other subaccounts the dca program is intended to reduce the effect of short term price fluctuations on investment cost since we transfer the same dollar amount to selected subaccounts monthly the dca program allows you to purchase more accumulation units when prices are low and fewer accumulation units when prices are high therefore you may achieve a lower average cost per accumulation unit over the longterm however it

present value refers to the amount of money needed today to fund the remaining guaranteed payments under the annuity payment option you select the primary factor in determining present value is the interest rate assumption we use if you are receiving annuity payments under an option that gives you the ability to take the present value of future payments in a lump sum and you elect to take the lump sum we will use the same interest rate assumption in calculating the present value that we used to determine your payment stream at the time your annuity payments commenced  payments of a fixed amount we will make equal payments in an amount you choose until the sum of all payments equals the contract value applied increased for interest credited of at least  the amount you choose must provide at least five years of payments these payments dont depend on the annuitants life if the annuitant dies before the guaranteed amount has been paid you may elect to have payments continued for the amount guaranteed or to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum if the contract owner dies while guaranteed amounts remain unpaid the beneficiary may elect to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum payments for a fixed period we will make equal payments for a period you select of at least five years these payments dont depend on the annuitants life if the annuitant dies before the end of the period you may elect to have payments continued for the period guaranteed or to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum if the contract owner dies while guaranteed amounts remain unpaid the beneficiary may elect to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum life annuity we make payments for as long as the annuitant lives payments will cease with the last payment made before the annuitants death   these options are pure life annuities therefore it is possible for the payee to receive only one annuity payment if the person or persons on whose life lives payment is based dies after only one payment or to receive only two annuity payments if that person those persons dies after only two payments etc  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th life annuity with payments guaranteed for    or  years we make payments for as long as the annuitant lives in addition even if the annuitant dies before the period ends we guarantee payments for either    or  years as you selected if the annuitant dies before the guaranteed period ends you may elect to have payments continued for the period guaranteed or to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum if the contract owner dies while guaranteed amounts remain unpaid the beneficiary may elect to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum life annuity with guaranteed return of contract value we make payments for as long as the annuitant lives in addition even if the annuitant dies we guarantee payments until the sum of all annuity payments equals the contract value applied if the annuitant dies while guaranteed amounts remain unpaid you may elect to have payments continued for the amount guaranteed or to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed amount in a lump sum if the contract owner dies while guaranteed amounts remain unpaid the beneficiary may elect to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed amount in a lump sum joint and survivor life annuity we make payments for the lives of the annuitant and a designated second person payments will continue as long as either one is living joint and survivor life annuity with payments guaranteed for    or  years we make payments during the lives of the annuitant and a designated second person payments will continue as long as either one is living in addition even if the annuitant and the designated second person die before the guaranteed period ends we guarantee payments for either    or  years as you selected if the annuitant and the designated second person die before the end of the period you may elect to have payments continued for the period guaranteed or to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum if the contract owner dies while guaranteed amounts remain unpaid the beneficiary may elect to receive the present value of the remaining guaranteed payments in a lump sum individual retirement account annuity this annuity option is available only to ira contract owners payments will be made annually based on either a the life expectancy of the annuitant b the joint life expectancy of the annuitant and his or her spouse c the life expectancy of the surviving spouse if the annuitant dies before the annuity date each annual payment will be equal to the remaining contract value on january  divided by the applicable current life expectancy as defined by internal revenue service regulations each subsequent payment will be made on the anniversary of the annuity date interest will be credited at our current rate for this option but will not be less than  on the death of the measuring life or lives prior to full distribution of the remaining value we will pay that value to the beneficiary in a lump sum   these options are pure life annuities therefore it is

annuitants unisex annuity purchase rates will provide the same annuity payments for male or female annuitants that are the same age on their annuity dates employers and employee organizations

discussion is based on our understanding of current federal income tax law as the internal revenue service irs now interprets it we cant guarantee that the law or the irss interpretation wont change it does not purport to be complete or to cover all tax situations this discussion is not intended as tax advice counsel or other tax advisors should be consulted for further information we havent considered any applicable federal gift estate or any state or other tax laws of course your own tax status or that of your beneficiary can affect the tax consequences of ownership or receipt of distributions tax status of the contract diversification requirements section h of the internal revenue code irc and the regulations under it provide that separate account investments underlying a contract must be adequately diversified for it to qualify as an annuity contract under irc section  the account through the subaccounts intends to comply with the diversification requirements of the regulations under section h this will affect how we make investments owner control in certain circumstances owners of variable annuity contracts have been considered for federal income tax purposes to be the owners of the assets of the separate account supporting their contracts due to their ability to exercise investment control over those assets when this is the case the contract owners have been currently taxed on income and gains attributable to the separate account assets there is little guidance in this area and some features such as the flexibility of an owner to allocate premium payments and transfer contract accumulation values have not been explicitly addressed in irs published rulings while we believe that the contracts do not give owners investment control over account assets we reserve the right to modify the contracts as necessary to prevent an owner from being treated as the owner of the account assets supporting the contract  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th required distributions to qualify as an annuity contract under section s of the irc a nonqualified annuity contract must provide that a if any owner dies on or after the annuity starting date but before all amounts under the contract have been distributed the remaining amounts will be distributed at least as quickly as under the method being used when the owner died and b if any owner dies before the annuity starting date all amounts under the contract will be distributed within five years of the date of death so long as the distributions begin within a year of the owners death the irs will consider these requirements satisfied for any part of the owners interest payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary and distributed over the beneficiarys life or over a period that cannot exceed the beneficiarys life expectancy a designated beneficiary is the person the owner names as beneficiary and who assumes ownership when the owner dies a designated beneficiary must be a natural person if the deceased owners spouse is the designated beneficiary he or she can continue the contract when such contract owner dies the contract is designed to comply with section s we will review the contract and amend it if necessary to make sure that it continues to comply with the sections requirements other rules regarding required distributions apply to individual retirement annuities taxation of annuities in general irc section  governs annuity taxation generally we believe an owner who is a natural person usually wont be taxed on increases in the value of a contract until there is a distribution ie the owner withdraws all or part of the accumulation or takes annuity payments assigning pledging or agreeing to assign or pledge any part of the accumulation usually will be considered a distribution distributions of accumulated investment earnings are taxable as ordinary income the owner of any annuity contract who is not a natural person eg a corporation or a trust generally must include in income any increase in the excess of the accumulation over the investment in the contract during the taxable year there are some exceptions to this rule and a prospective owner that is not a natural person may wish to discuss them with a competent tax advisor the following discussion applies generally to contracts owned by a natural person withdrawals and surrenders when you take a withdrawal from a contract the amount received generally will be treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to an amount equal to the excess if any of the contract value immediately before the distribution over the investment in the contract generally the premiums or other consideration paid for the contract reduced by any amount previously distributed from the contract that was not subject to tax at that time other rules apply to individual retirement annuities if you withdraw your entire contract value you will be taxed only on the part that exceeds your investment in the contract annuity payments although tax consequences may vary depending on the annuity option selected under an annuity contract a portion of each annuity payment is generally not taxed and the remainder is taxed as ordinary income the  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th nontaxable portion of an annuity payment is generally determined in a manner that is designed to allow you to recover your investment in the contract ratably on a taxfree basis over the expected stream of annuity payments as determined when annuity payments start once your investment in the contract has been fully recovered however the full amount of each annuity payment is subject to tax as ordinary income taxation of death benefit proceeds amounts may be paid from a contract because an owner or annuitant if an owner is not a natural person has died if the payments are made in a single sum theyre taxed the same way a full withdrawal from the contract is taxed if they are distributed as annuity payments theyre taxed as annuity payments penalty tax on some withdrawals you may have to pay a penalty tax  percent of the amount treated as taxable income on some withdrawals however there is usually no penalty on distributions  on or after you reach age    after you die or after the annuitant dies if an owner isnt an individual  after you become disabled or  that are part of a series of substantially equal periodic at least annual payments for your life or life expectancy or the joint lives or life expectancies of you and your beneficiary other exceptions may be applicable under certain circumstances and special rules may apply in connection with the exceptions listed above also additional exceptions apply to distributions from an individual retirement annuity you should consult a tax adviser with regard to exceptions from the penalty tax transfers assignments or exchanges of a contract transferring or assigning ownership of the contract designating a payee or beneficiary who is not also the owner or exchanging a contract can have other tax consequences that we dont discuss here if youre thinking about any of those transactions contact a tax advisor withholding annuity distributions usually are subject to withholding for the recipients federal income tax liability at rates that vary according to the type of distribution and the recipients tax status however recipients can usually choose not to have tax withheld from distributions multiple contracts all nonqualified deferred annuity contracts that we or our affiliates issue to the same owner during any calendar year are generally treated as one annuity contract for purposes of determining the amount includible in such owners income when a taxable distribution occurs this could affect when income is taxable and how much is subject to the ten percent penalty tax discussed above  pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th possible changes in taxation although the likelihood of legislative change is uncertain there is always the possibility that the tax treatment of the contracts could change by legislation or other means it is also possible that any change could be retroactive that is effective prior to the date of the change a tax adviser should be consulted with respect to legislative developments and their effect on the contract possible charge for our taxes

used to help you increase your savings protect what youve saved or generate a stream of income have us call you annuities generally fall into two categories deferred and income each works differently and offers unique advantages taxdeferred annuities for retirement savings deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once youve made the maximum allowable contributions to your k or ira like any taxdeferred investment earnings compound over time providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack deferred annuities have no irs contribution limits so you can invest as much as you want for retirement you can also use your savings to create a guaranteed stream of income for retirement depending on how annuities are funded they may not have minimum required distributions mrds bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax and if taken before age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds which will affect your returns deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth however this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss while still participating in potential market growth deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed rate of return for a number of years fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility in this way they’re similar to certificates of deposit cds however deferred fixed annuities differ from cds in that annuities are not fdicinsured withdrawals from annuities prior to age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a cd annuity earnings compound on a taxdeferred basis income annuities for income in retirement income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed income for life or a set period of time they may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio since they provide a lifetime income stream keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed predictable payment for life or for a certain period of time your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility helping shield your retirement income from market risk a costofliving increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation deferred income annuities are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start because of the deferral period you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment the costofliving increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities to buy or learn more   find an investor center  each individuals situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested although variable annuities offer taxdeferral if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or ira you should do so for the variable annuitys features and
