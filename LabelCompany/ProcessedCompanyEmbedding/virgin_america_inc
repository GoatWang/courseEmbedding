virgin america inc in hawaii virgin america inc hopes to start flying to hawaii later this year will it face too much competition in this crowded market adam levineweinberg tmfgemhunter mar   at am virgin america nasdaq va has been in the midst of a growth hiatus for more than  years but it is planning to start expanding again later this year to kick of this new growth initiative management has already stated that adding flights to hawaii is a key priority once it returns to growth virgin america hopes to start flying from the west coast to hawaii later this year photo virgin america many analysts and investors seem to be skeptical of this plan after all hawaiian airlines nasdaqha and other top carriers in the west coasthawaii travel market have recently discussed their markets existing overcapacity however san francisco and los angeles  virgin americas two hubs  are both huge markets for travel to hawaii furthermore virgin america has lots of loyal fans in both cities as a result it should have no trouble carving out a nice market niche with its premium offering on flights to hawaii aloha hawaiiwhen virgin america begins its flights to hawaii it will join a crowded market today  carriers fly nonstop from san francisco to hawaii while  fly nonstop from los angeles to hawaii at first this might make hawaii flights seem unpalatable however the large number of competitors is an indicator of the massive size of these markets this summer airlines will operate more than  dozen daily flights to hawaii from los angeles alone there are already numerous flight options between california and hawaii photo wikimedia commons at present virgin america does extremely well on the similarly busy transcontinental routes from new york to san francisco and los angeles where it is one of  airlines offering nonstop service its unique premium offering  with wifi mood lighting an innovative seatback entertainment system and other amenities  has allowed virgin america to hold its own against much bigger rivals the same attributes should make plenty of travelers pick virgin america when planning trips to hawaii indeed loyal virgin america customers have been requesting flights to hawaii for years as a stopgap measure the company implemented a codeshare arrangement with hawaiian airlines in late  if virgin americas entry into the hawaii market creates a capacity imbalance other airlines are likely to pull back on their own hawaii flying to foster a supplydemand balance they would probably do so by switching to smaller planes for their hawaii flights but even this may be a moot point hawaiian airlines told investors this week that its q unit revenue will not decline as much as originally expected this implies that demand for west coasthawaii flights may already be catching up with supply more reasons to love flights to hawaiivirgin america wont have to charge outrageous fares to make money flying to hawaii either the new planes it is receiving beginning in july will be modern seat airbus as equipped with fuelsaving sharklet winglets these planes will have lower unit costs than many of the planes currently flying to hawaii including mediumsized widebodies like the boeing and oldertechnology planes like the boeing  virgin america will also offer arguably the best first class seats for west coasthawaii flights competitors have leapfrogged virgin americas premium product on transcontinental routes by installing lieflat beds but almost all of the first class seats on hawaii routes are the domestic variant virgin america will have the best firstclass seats flying to hawaii photo virgin america these are no match for virgin americas wide white leather first class seats with  of legroom this superior offering should help virgin america drive strong sales of its lucrative first class seats buckle upvirgin americas routes to hawaii may not be immediately profitable  new airline routes seldom are however the companys relatively low costs and differentiated product should allow it to compete for the long haul on flights from its san francisco and los angeles bases to hawaii in fact by bringing a premium atmosphere to hawaii flights virgin america could force its competitors to up their standards  just as it did in the transcontinental market not too long ago adam levineweinberg owns shares of
