challenged and removed september  learn how and when to remove this template message work on the new audio format started in  four years after dolby laboratories started work on its new codec dolby digital the basic and most common version of the format is a channel system similar to a dolby digital setup which encodes the audio as five primary fullrange channels plus a special lfe lowfrequency effects channel for the subwoofer encoders and decoders support numerous channel combinations and stereo fourchannel and fourchannellfe soundtracks have been released commercially on dvd cd and laserdisc other newer dts variants are also currently available including versions that support up to seven primary audio channels plus one lfe channel dtses these variants are generally based on dtss coreandextension philosophy in which a core dts data stream is augmented with an extension stream which includes the additional data necessary for the new variant in use the core stream can be decoded by any dts decoder even if it does not understand the new variant a decoder which does understand the new variant decodes the core stream and then modifies it according to the instructions contained in the extension stream this method allows backward compatibility dtss main competitors in multichannel theatrical audio are dolby digital and sdds although only dolby digital and dts are used on dvds and implemented in home theater hardware one of the dts incs initial investors was film director steven spielberg who felt that theatrical sound formats up until the companys founding were no longer state of the art and as a result were no longer optimal for use on projects where quality sound reproduction was of the utmost importance spielberg debuted the format with his  production of jurassic park which came slightly less than a full year after the official theatrical debut of dolby digital batman returns in addition jurassic park also became the first home video release to contain dts sound when it was released on laserdisc in january  two years after the first dolby digital home video release clear and present danger on laserdisc which debuted in january  in  the cinema division

announced that it was being purchased by dts for us million uniting ibiquitys hd radio digital radio broadcast technology with dts digital audio surround sound systems theatrical useedit in theatrical use a proprietary bit time code is optically imaged onto the film an led reader scans the timecode data from the film and sends it to the dts processor using the time code to synchronize the projected image with the dts soundtrack audio the multichannel dts audio is recorded in compressed form on standard cdrom media at a bitrate of  kbits the audio compression used in the theatrical dts system which is very different and completely unrelated to the home coherent acousticsbased dts digital surround format is the aptx system unlike the home version of dts or any version of dolby digital the aptx system is fixed at a  compression ratio data reduction is accomplished via subband coding with linear prediction and adaptive quantization the theatrical dts processor acts as a transport mechanism as it holds and reads the audio discs when the dts format was launched it used one or two discs with later units holding three discs thus allowing a single dts processor to handle twodisc film soundtracks along with a third disc for theatrical trailers the dts time code on the mm print identifies the film title which is matched to the individual dts cdroms guaranteeing that the film cannot be played with the wrong disc each dts cdrom contains a dos program that the processor uses to play back the soundtrack allowing system improvements or bug fixes to be added easily unlike dolby digital and sdds or the home version of dts the theatrical dts system only carries  discrete channels on the cdroms the  lfe subwoofer track is mixed into the discrete surround channels on the disc and recovered via lowpass filters in the theater dts audio codecedit on the consumer level dts is the oftused shorthand for the dts coherent acoustics dca codec transportable through spdif and part of the laserdisc dvd and bluray specifications this system is the consumer version of the dts standard using a similar codec without needing separate dts cdrom media both music and movie dvds allow delivery of dts audio signal but dts was not part of the original dvd specification so early dvd players do not recognize dts audio tracks at all the dvd specification was revisedwhen to allow optional inclusion of dts audio tracks the dvd title must carry one or more primary audio tracks in ac or lpcm format in europe mpeg audio layer ii is also an allowed primary track format the dts audio track if present can be selected by the user subsequent dvd players now decode dts natively or pass it through to an external decoder nearly all standalone receivers and many integrated dvd playerreceivers can decode dts a small number of laserdiscs carry dts soundtracks the ntsc laserdisc format allows for either analog audio only or both analog and digital audio tracks laserdiscs encoded with dts sound  replace the lpcm digital audio track with the dts soundtrack this soundtrack is output via digital coaxial or optical audio outputs and requires an external decoder to process the bitstream for pc playback many software players support the decoding of dts the videolan project has created a decoding module for dts called libdca formerly libdts which is the first open source implementation of dts sonys playstation  and microsofts xbox  are capable of dts decoding and output via toslink or hdmi as lpcm however hdmi output on the xbox  is only found on the elite model and newer models available since mid with the release of the falcon motherboard revision also the xbox  cannot decode dts from dts audio cds playstation  consoles can bitstream dts over hdmi the newer slim models are able to bitstream dtshd ma as well dts technologiesedit in addition to the standard channel dts surround codec the company has several other technologies in its product range designed to compete with similar systems from dolby labs those which conceptually extend dts to add more channels andor more accurate sound reproduction are implemented as extensions to a core dts coherent acoustics data stream the core stream is compatible with dts decoders which do not support the extensions the extensions provide the additional data required to implement the additional functionality the primary new technologies are dts  mmedit this is a process designed specifically for playback in motion picture theaters equipped with mm projection and track surround sound the  mm dts prints do not have track magnetic striping so there is no analog backup should the digital sound fail the time code track on the film is many times wider than the mm version since it can occupy the real estate formerly taken up by a magnetic track theaters with  mm dts frequently install two time code readers for greater reliability the gradual disappearance of  mm as a common exhibition format has led to dts being reserved for niche engagements of  mm revivals and restorations dolby digital has not been adapted to the  mm format dtsesedit dtses dts extended surround includes two variants dtses matrix and dtses discrete  depending on how the sound was originally mastered and stored both variants are implemented in ways which are compatible with dts decoders which do not include support for dtses dtses matrix provides  discrete channels with a matrixed centersurround audio channel dts processors that are compatible with the es codec look for and recognize flags built into the audio coding and unfold the rearcenter sound from data that would otherwise be sent to rear surround speakers dts decoders which do not understand es process the sound as if it were standard  and the matrixed audio for the center surround channel is output equally from the two surround speakers very much as a sound intended to be in the centre of the sound field in a stereo recording is played equally by the left and right speakers this is notated as dtses  dtses discrete provides  discrete channels with a discretely recorded nonmatrixed centersurround channel in home theater systems with a  configuration the two rearcenter speakers play in mono to maintain compatibility with dts decoders which do not support dtses the centersurround channel is also matrixed into the left and right surround channels so that the rear center channels sound is still present when played in  on a nones system an es decoder removes the matrixed audio from these two channels when playing back dtses discrete soundtracks dtses discrete is sometimes notated as dtses  only a few dvd titles have been released with dtses discrete in contrast dolbys competing ex codec which also boasts a center rear channel can only handle matrixed data and does not support a discrete sixth channel it is most directly comparable to dtses matrix note the centerrearsurround channel is encoded and decoded in exactly the same way as the centerfront the center surround channel can be decoded using any surround sound processor by feeding the left and right surround signals to the processor inputs leftcenterright surround is produced this will work for a center surround reproduction whether the source material is explicitly encoded as in dtses or hidden as ambience in any  source including dtses  and dolby  dts neoedit dts neo like dolbys pro logic iix system can convert    and  content sound to     and  channel systems a  systems  rear speakers are mono neo is a multiband decoder unlike dolby pro logic iis broadband logic steering meaning that the decoder can enhance more than one predominant signal at a time — provided each predominant signal lies in a different frequency band than the others the number of bands steered varies in each neo implementation with the first decoders steering in  separate bands and later units steering up to  dts neoxedit dts neox can take stereo   or  source material and output up to  channels including front height and width channels unlike dolbys pro logic iizs system which only adds front height channels to the  configuration neox supports both front height and front wide channels dts neox also supports  encoding through matrixing of front height and front wide channel information into the front and surround channels respectively of a  or  audio mix dts edit dts  allows the delivery of  channels of bit  khz audio and high quality video on the dvdvideo format prior to the development of dts  it was only possible to deliver two channels of bit  khz audio on dvd

audio technology for both the bluray disc bd dtsxedit dtsx logo rather than define a fixed number of channels one for each speaker dtsx allows the location direction from the listener of objects audio tracks to be specified as polar coordinates the audio processor is then responsible for dynamically rendering sound output depending on the number and position of speakers available dolby atmos uses a

comparison with other formatsedit dts and dolby digital ac dtss chief competitor in the cinema theatre and home theatre markets are often compared because of their similarity in product goals though dolby believed that the surround channels should be diffusedclarification needed and dts said they should be directionalcitation needed in theatrical installations ac audio is placed between sprocket holes on the  mm film itself leaving the audio content susceptible to physical damage from film wear and mishandling dts audio is stored on a separate set of cdrom media whose greater storage capacity affords the potential to deliver better audio fidelity and is not subject to the usual wear and damage suffered by the film print during the normal course of the movies theatrical screening disregarding the separate cdrom assembly as a potential point of failure the dts audiopath is comparatively impervious to film degradation unless the filmprinted timecode is completely destroyed in the consumer home theater market ac and dts are close in terms of audio performance when the dts audio track is encoded at its highest legal bitrate  kbits technical experts rank dts as perceptually

specifications this system is the consumer version of the dts standard using a similar codec without needing separate dts cdrom media both music and movie dvds allow delivery of dts audio signal but dts was not part of the original dvd specification so early dvd players do not recognize dts audio tracks at all the dvd specification was revisedwhen to allow optional inclusion of dts audio tracks the dvd title must carry one or more primary audio tracks in ac or lpcm format in europe mpeg audio layer ii is also an allowed primary track format the dts audio track if present can be selected by the user subsequent dvd players now decode dts natively or pass it through to an external decoder nearly all standalone receivers and many integrated dvd playerreceivers can decode dts a small number of laserdiscs carry dts soundtracks the ntsc laserdisc format allows for either analog audio only or both analog and digital audio tracks laserdiscs encoded with dts sound  replace the lpcm digital audio track with the dts soundtrack this soundtrack is output via digital coaxial or optical audio outputs and requires an external decoder to process the bitstream for pc playback many software players support the decoding of dts the videolan project has created a decoding module for dts called libdca formerly libdts which is the first open source implementation of dts sonys playstation  and microsofts xbox  are capable of dts decoding and output via toslink or hdmi as lpcm however hdmi output on the xbox  is only found on the elite model and newer models available since mid with the release of the falcon motherboard revision also the xbox  cannot decode dts from dts audio cds playstation  consoles can bitstream dts over hdmi the newer slim models are able to bitstream dtshd ma as well dts technologiesedit in addition to the standard channel dts surround codec the company has several other technologies in its product range designed to compete with similar systems from dolby labs those which conceptually extend dts to add more channels andor more accurate sound reproduction are implemented as extensions to a core dts coherent acoustics data stream the core stream is compatible with dts decoders which do not support the extensions the extensions provide the additional data required to implement the additional functionality the primary new technologies are dts  mmedit this is a process designed specifically for playback in motion picture theaters equipped with mm projection and track surround sound the  mm dts prints do not have track magnetic striping so there is no analog backup should the digital sound fail the time code track on the film is many times wider than the mm version since it can occupy the real estate formerly taken up by a magnetic track theaters with  mm dts frequently install two time code readers for greater reliability the gradual disappearance of  mm as a common exhibition format has led to dts being reserved for niche engagements of  mm revivals and restorations dolby digital has not been adapted to the  mm format dtsesedit dtses dts extended surround includes two variants dtses matrix and dtses discrete  depending on how the sound was originally mastered and stored both variants are implemented in ways which are compatible with dts decoders which do not include support for dtses dtses matrix provides  discrete channels with a matrixed centersurround audio channel dts processors that are compatible with the es codec look for and recognize flags built into the audio coding and unfold the rearcenter sound from data that would otherwise be sent to rear surround speakers dts decoders which do not understand es process the sound as if it were standard  and the matrixed audio for the center surround channel is output equally from the two surround speakers very much as a sound intended to be in the centre of the sound field in a stereo recording is played equally by the left and right speakers this is notated as dtses  dtses discrete provides  discrete channels with a discretely recorded nonmatrixed centersurround channel in home theater systems with a  configuration the two rearcenter speakers play in mono to maintain compatibility with dts decoders which do not support dtses the centersurround channel is also matrixed into the left and right surround channels so that the rear center channels sound is still present when played in  on a nones system an es decoder removes the matrixed audio from these two channels when playing back dtses discrete soundtracks dtses discrete is sometimes notated as dtses  only a few dvd titles have been released with dtses discrete in contrast dolbys competing ex codec which also boasts a center rear channel can only handle matrixed data and does not support a discrete sixth channel it is most directly comparable to dtses matrix note the centerrearsurround channel is encoded and decoded in exactly the same way as the centerfront the center surround channel can be decoded using any surround sound processor by feeding the left and right surround signals to the processor inputs leftcenterright surround is produced this will work for a center surround reproduction whether the source material is explicitly encoded as in dtses or hidden as ambience in any  source including dtses  and dolby  dts neoedit dts neo like dolbys pro logic iix system can convert    and  content sound to     and  channel systems a  systems  rear speakers are mono neo is a multiband decoder unlike dolby pro logic iis broadband logic steering meaning that the decoder can enhance more than one predominant signal at a time — provided each predominant signal lies in a different frequency band than the others the number of bands steered varies in each neo implementation with the first decoders steering in  separate bands and later units steering up to  dts neoxedit dts neox can take stereo   or  source material and output up to  channels including front height and width channels unlike dolbys pro logic iizs system which only adds front height channels to the  configuration neox supports both front height and front wide channels dts neox also supports  encoding through matrixing of front height and front wide channel information into the front and surround channels respectively of a  or  audio mix dts edit dts  allows the delivery of  channels of bit  khz audio and high quality video on the dvdvideo format prior to the development of dts  it was only possible to deliver two channels of bit  khz audio on dvd video dts  can also be

supports variable bit rates up to  mbits with up to  channels encoded at up to  khz or  channels and nine objects encoded at  khz bit if more than two channels are used a channel remapping function allows for remixing the soundtrack to compensate for a different channel layout in the playback system compared to the original mix all bluray players can decode the dts core resolution soundtrack at  mbits however as dtshd master audio is also implemented as a standard dts core plus extensions dtshd master audio and dolby truehd are the only technologies that deliver compressed lossless surround

both the bluray disc bd dtsxedit dtsx logo rather than define a fixed number of channels one for each speaker dtsx allows the location direction from the listener of objects audio tracks to be specified as polar coordinates the audio processor is then responsible for dynamically rendering sound output depending on the number and position of speakers available dolby atmos uses a similar technique although the speaker layout employed by cinema dtsx is the sum of dolby atmos and aurod the layout showcased at amc burbank theatre number  has a standard eight channel base layer a five channel height layer on top of the base layer on the front and side walls and three rows of speakers on the ceiling the surround arrays are bass managed by woofers suspended from the ceiling dts

message work on the new audio format started in  four years after dolby laboratories started work on its new codec dolby digital the basic and most common version of the format is a channel system similar to a dolby digital setup which encodes the audio as five primary fullrange channels plus a special lfe lowfrequency effects channel for the subwoofer encoders and decoders support numerous channel combinations and stereo fourchannel and fourchannellfe soundtracks have been released commercially on dvd cd and laserdisc other newer dts variants are also currently available including versions that support up to seven primary audio channels plus one lfe channel dtses these variants are generally based on dtss coreandextension philosophy in which a core dts data stream is augmented with an extension stream which includes the additional data necessary for the new variant in use the core stream can be decoded by any dts decoder even if it does not understand the new variant a decoder which does understand the new variant decodes the core stream and then modifies it according to the instructions contained in the extension stream this method allows backward compatibility dtss main competitors in multichannel theatrical audio are dolby digital and sdds although only dolby digital and dts are used on dvds and implemented in home theater hardware one of the dts incs initial investors was film director steven spielberg who felt that theatrical sound formats up until the companys founding were no longer state of the art and as a result were no longer optimal for use on projects where quality sound reproduction was of the utmost importance spielberg debuted the format with his  production of jurassic park which came slightly less than a full year after the official theatrical debut of dolby digital batman returns in addition jurassic park also became the first home video release to contain dts sound when it was released on laserdisc in january  two years after the first dolby digital home video release clear and present danger on laserdisc which debuted in january  in  the cinema division was divested to form dts digital cinema in  dts digital

million uniting ibiquitys hd radio digital radio broadcast technology with dts digital audio surround sound systems theatrical useedit in theatrical use a proprietary bit time code is optically imaged onto the film an led reader scans the timecode data from the film and sends it to the dts processor using the time code to synchronize the projected image with the dts soundtrack audio the multichannel dts audio is recorded in compressed form on standard cdrom media at a bitrate of  kbits the audio compression used in the theatrical dts system which is very different and completely unrelated to the home coherent acousticsbased dts digital surround format is the aptx system unlike the home version of dts or any version of dolby digital the aptx system is fixed at a  compression ratio data reduction is accomplished via subband coding with linear prediction and adaptive quantization the theatrical dts processor acts as a transport mechanism as it holds and reads the audio discs when the dts format was launched it used one or two discs with later units holding three discs thus allowing a single dts processor to handle twodisc film soundtracks along with a third disc for theatrical trailers the dts time code on the mm print identifies the film title which is matched to the individual dts cdroms guaranteeing that the film cannot be played with the wrong disc each dts cdrom contains a dos program that the processor uses to play back the soundtrack allowing system improvements or bug fixes to be added easily unlike dolby digital and sdds or the home version of dts the theatrical dts system only carries  discrete channels on the cdroms the  lfe subwoofer track is mixed into the discrete surround channels on the disc and recovered via lowpass filters in the theater dts audio codecedit on the consumer level dts is the oftused shorthand for the dts coherent acoustics dca codec transportable through spdif and part of the laserdisc dvd and bluray specifications this system is the consumer version of the dts standard using a similar codec without needing separate dts cdrom media both music and movie dvds allow delivery of dts audio signal but dts was not part of the original dvd specification so early dvd players do not recognize dts audio tracks at all the dvd specification was revisedwhen to allow optional inclusion of dts audio tracks the dvd title must carry one or more primary audio tracks in ac or lpcm format in europe mpeg audio layer ii is also an allowed primary track format the dts audio track if present can be selected by the user subsequent dvd players now decode dts natively or pass it through to an external decoder nearly all standalone receivers and many integrated dvd playerreceivers can decode dts a small number of laserdiscs carry dts soundtracks the ntsc laserdisc format allows for either analog audio only or both analog and digital audio tracks laserdiscs encoded with dts sound  replace the lpcm digital

message work on the new audio format started in  four years after dolby laboratories started work on its new codec dolby digital the basic and most common version of the format is a channel system similar to a dolby digital setup which encodes the audio as five primary fullrange channels plus a special lfe lowfrequency effects channel for the subwoofer encoders and decoders support numerous channel combinations and stereo fourchannel and fourchannellfe soundtracks have been released commercially on dvd cd and laserdisc other newer dts variants are also currently available including versions that support up to seven primary audio channels plus one lfe channel dtses these variants are generally based on dtss coreandextension philosophy in which a core dts data stream is augmented with an extension stream which includes the additional data necessary for the new variant in use the core stream can be decoded by any dts decoder even if it does not understand the new variant a decoder which does understand the new variant decodes the core stream and then modifies it according to the instructions contained in the extension stream this method allows backward compatibility dtss main competitors in multichannel theatrical audio are dolby digital and sdds although only dolby digital and dts are used on dvds and implemented in home theater hardware one of the dts incs initial investors was film director steven spielberg who felt that theatrical sound formats up until the companys founding were no longer state of the art and as a result were no longer optimal for use on projects where quality sound reproduction was of the utmost importance spielberg debuted the format with his  production of jurassic park which came slightly less than a full year after the official theatrical debut of dolby digital batman returns in addition jurassic park also became the first home video release to contain dts sound when it was released on laserdisc in january  two years after the first dolby digital home video release clear and present danger on laserdisc which debuted in january  in  the cinema division was divested to form dts digital cinema in  dts digital

is a los angeles based technology group dedicated to wireless audio solutions for connected devices hd radio ibiquityedit on september   ibiquity announced that it was being purchased by dts for us million uniting ibiquitys hd radio digital radio broadcast technology with dts digital audio surround sound systems theatrical useedit in theatrical use a proprietary bit time code is optically imaged onto the film an led reader scans the timecode data from the film and sends it to the dts processor using the time code to synchronize the projected image with the dts soundtrack audio the multichannel dts audio is recorded in compressed form on standard cdrom media at a bitrate of  kbits the audio compression used in the theatrical dts system which is very different and completely unrelated to the home coherent acousticsbased dts digital surround format is the aptx system unlike the home version of dts or any version of dolby digital the aptx system is fixed at a  compression ratio data reduction is accomplished via subband coding with linear prediction and adaptive quantization the theatrical dts processor acts as a transport mechanism as it holds and reads the audio discs when the dts format was launched it used one or two discs with later units holding three discs thus allowing a single dts processor to handle twodisc film soundtracks along with a third disc for theatrical trailers the dts time code on the mm print identifies the film title which is matched to the individual dts cdroms guaranteeing that the film cannot be played with the wrong disc each dts cdrom contains a dos program that the processor uses to play back the soundtrack allowing system improvements or bug fixes to be added easily unlike dolby digital and sdds or the home version of dts the theatrical dts system only carries  discrete channels on the cdroms the  lfe subwoofer track is mixed into the discrete surround channels on the disc and recovered via lowpass filters in the theater dts audio codecedit on the consumer level dts is the oftused shorthand for the dts coherent acoustics dca codec transportable through spdif and part of the laserdisc dvd and bluray specifications this system is the consumer version of the dts standard using a similar codec without needing separate dts cdrom media both music and movie dvds allow delivery of dts audio signal but dts was not part of the original dvd specification so early dvd players do not recognize dts audio tracks at all the dvd specification was revisedwhen to allow optional inclusion of dts audio tracks the dvd title must carry one or more primary audio tracks in ac or lpcm format in europe mpeg audio layer ii is also an allowed primary track format the dts audio track if present can be selected by the user subsequent dvd players now decode dts natively or pass it through to an external decoder nearly all standalone receivers and many integrated dvd playerreceivers can decode dts a small number of laserdiscs carry dts soundtracks the ntsc laserdisc format allows for either analog audio only or both analog and digital audio tracks laserdiscs encoded with dts sound  replace the lpcm digital audio track with the dts soundtrack this soundtrack is output via digital coaxial or optical audio outputs and requires an external decoder to process the bitstream for pc playback many software players support the decoding of dts the videolan project has created a decoding module for dts called libdca formerly libdts which is the first open source implementation of dts sonys playstation  and microsofts xbox  are capable of dts decoding and output via toslink or hdmi as lpcm however hdmi output on the xbox  is only found on the elite model and newer models available since mid with the release of the falcon motherboard revision also the xbox  cannot decode dts from dts audio cds playstation  consoles can bitstream dts over hdmi the newer slim models are able to bitstream dtshd ma as well dts technologiesedit in addition to the standard channel dts surround codec the company has several other technologies in its product range designed to compete with similar systems from dolby labs those which conceptually extend dts to add more channels andor more accurate sound reproduction are implemented as extensions to a core dts coherent acoustics data stream the core stream is compatible with dts decoders which do not support the extensions the extensions provide the additional data required to implement the additional functionality the primary new technologies are dts  mmedit this is a process designed specifically for playback in motion picture theaters equipped with mm projection and track surround sound the  mm dts prints do not have track magnetic striping so there is no analog backup should the digital sound fail the time code track on the film is many times wider than the mm version since it can occupy the real estate formerly taken up by a magnetic track theaters with  mm dts frequently install two time code readers for greater reliability the gradual disappearance of  mm as a common exhibition format has led to dts being reserved for niche engagements of  mm revivals and restorations dolby digital has not been adapted to the  mm format dtsesedit dtses dts extended surround includes two variants dtses matrix and dtses discrete  depending on how the sound was originally mastered and stored both variants are implemented in ways which are compatible with dts decoders which do not include support for dtses dtses matrix provides  discrete channels with a matrixed centersurround audio channel dts processors that are compatible with the es codec look for and recognize flags built into the audio coding and unfold the rearcenter sound from data that would otherwise be sent to rear surround speakers dts decoders which do not understand es process the sound as if it were standard  and the matrixed audio for the center surround channel is output equally from the two surround speakers very much as a sound intended to be in the centre of the sound field in a stereo recording is played equally by the left and right speakers this is notated as dtses  dtses discrete provides  discrete channels with a discretely recorded nonmatrixed centersurround channel in home theater systems with a  configuration the two rearcenter speakers play in mono to maintain compatibility with dts decoders which do not support dtses the centersurround channel is also matrixed into the left and right surround channels so that the rear center channels sound is still present when played in  on a nones system an es decoder removes the matrixed audio from these two channels when playing back dtses discrete soundtracks dtses discrete is sometimes notated as dtses  only a few dvd titles have been released with dtses discrete in contrast dolbys competing ex codec which also boasts a center rear channel can only handle matrixed data and does not support a discrete sixth channel it is most directly comparable to dtses matrix note the centerrearsurround channel is encoded and decoded in exactly the same way as the centerfront the center surround channel can be decoded using any surround sound processor by feeding the left and right surround signals to the processor inputs leftcenterright surround is produced this will work for a center surround reproduction whether the source material is explicitly encoded as in dtses or hidden as ambience in any  source including dtses  and dolby  dts neoedit dts neo like dolbys pro logic iix system can convert    and  content sound to     and  channel systems a  systems  rear speakers are mono neo is a multiband decoder unlike dolby pro logic iis broadband logic steering meaning that the decoder can enhance more than one predominant signal at a time — provided each predominant signal lies in a different frequency band than the others the number of bands steered varies in each neo implementation with the first decoders steering in  separate bands and later units steering up to  dts neoxedit dts neox can take stereo   or  source material and output up to  channels including front height and width channels unlike dolbys pro logic iizs system which only adds front height channels to the  configuration neox supports both front height and front wide channels dts neox also supports  encoding through matrixing of front height and front wide channel information into the front and surround channels respectively of a  or  audio mix dts edit dts  allows the delivery of

supports variable bit rates up to  mbits with up to  channels encoded at up to  khz or  channels and nine objects encoded at  khz bit if more than two channels are used a channel remapping function allows for remixing the soundtrack to compensate for a different channel layout in the playback system compared to the original mix all bluray players can decode the dts core resolution soundtrack at  mbits however as dtshd master audio is also implemented as a standard dts core plus extensions dtshd master audio and dolby truehd are the only technologies that deliver compressed lossless surround

both the bluray disc bd dtsxedit dtsx logo rather than define a fixed number of channels one for each speaker dtsx allows the location direction from the listener of objects audio tracks to be specified as polar coordinates the audio processor is then responsible for dynamically rendering sound output depending on the number and position of speakers available dolby atmos uses a similar technique although the speaker layout employed by cinema dtsx is the sum of dolby atmos and aurod the layout showcased at amc burbank theatre number  has a standard eight channel base layer a five

recovery system srs dynamically recovers disk space allocation failures when srs intercepts a space failure the installation rules are used to determine the recovery options if the rules allow recovery srs forces the operating system to get the required disk space and the job runs to completion               srs recovery messages for sequential data sets               srs recovery messages for a vsam define cluster   the space recovery system srs eliminates all types of storage spacerelated errors whether the error is caused by application growth outofdate jcl volume space fragmentation or job conflicts srs steps in to dynamically modify space needs find available space and prevent failures srs not only improves system throughput but provides a critical safety net that allows installations to achieve higher rates of disk space utilization than could ever be accomplished in any other way eliminate  b d e abends and vsam errors srs determines in advance when an outofspace condition will occur and prevents the error production downtime and reruns due to space problems are eliminated support for all types of data srs can prevent problems for all types of datasets smsmanaged or nonsms vsam or nonvsam striped extendedformat hfs and others automatic reorganization of multivolume datasets when an application releases a dataset that srs has extended to an additional volume srs can automatically invoke system utilities to copy the dataset back to a single volume if space is available catalog and tape error prevention srs does more that just prevent dasd space errors duplicate dataset name and notcatlgd errors can be stopped s tape errors can be eliminated and output datasets can automatically be switched to tape units with nonempty automatic cartridge loaders extensions allow better control over space use the srse function allows installations to automatically route desired datasets to vio limit dataset space requests add rlse parameters

follow on those occasions when dts technical support was required i have always received prompt accurate and courteous support from dts technicians  they always exhibited technical expertise and professionalism elaine finch bank of america we have used dts srs software for years and it has worked flawlessly it has been very easy to install and absolutely user friendly also the support cannot be beat mark sisbarro ebsco industries  recently we had a db problemissue involving dasd storage being a user of srs we got in touch with your support group and almost immediately they responded with a great update  pointing back to a user issue the bottom line here is that i received a great reply in a matter of an hour or so rather than waiting hours or days for some rep to tell us they need more documentation that support has been getting rare among our vendors so please feel free to pass along my thanks for a job well done by your support team dave kucharski bluecross blueshield of illinois  the owners of dts software wrote the original stopx recovery product in the early ’s and marketed the product through empact software after a very successful startup and deep market penetration the original development company eti and empact were purchased in the late ’s  three years later the original stopx developers created dts software to write acc for the japanese market at that time dts had no intention of competing with stopx the product had an insurmountable market penetration rock solid stability and the founders at dts had no desire to compete with the original product three things happened that changed the situation the removal of stopx  boole and babbage the new owner’s of stopx purchased a european product called gosms after rebranding the product suite as prosms and renaming the x recovery component as stopx ii boole upgraded the customer base to the new product since boole charged for the upgrade there was no easy way to return customers to the original stopx customer need  the original stopx ii had serious stability problems when released the problems were magnified by the fact that the product was released into a large install base the original developers now at dts started getting calls and complaints about the new version – one of the pitfalls of giving out home phone numbers a new design  once it was obvious that stopx ii was failing dts started talking about the possibility of creating another x recovery product technically and legally dts would have had no difficultly reentering the market however the developers never considered recreating a technically similar product eventually a dts developer found a very clever way to perform x recoveries that used a much simpler algorithm than the original product once dts decided to reenter the x recovery market boole was notified about the new product and dts offered their engineers sourcecode access to the prototype eventually boole took the offer and verified that srs used a completely different recovery algorithm  srs was introduced to the market in    dts software inc all rights reserved      legal      privacy company home page about dts social media
