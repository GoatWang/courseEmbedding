shoot rare fastmoving elephants you should always carry a loaded gun  warren buffettdoing what everyone else is doing at the moment and therefore what you have an almost irresistible urge to do is often the wrong thing to do at all  phil fisher“it is impossible to produce superior performance unless you do something different from the majority”  john templetonthe single greatest edge an investor can have is a longterm orientation  seth klarman“in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine”  ben grahamin the world of investing being

wrong  peter lynchindividuals who cannot master their emotions are illsuited to profit from the investment process  ben grahamit just seems logical that sticking to investing in only a small number of companies that you understand well rather than moving down the list to your thirtieth or fiftieth favorite pick would create a much greater potential to earn aboveaverage investment returns  joel greenblattthe most realistic distinction between the investor and the speculator is found in their attitude toward stockmarket movements the speculators primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations the investors primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices market movements are important to him in a practical sense because they alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell  ben
