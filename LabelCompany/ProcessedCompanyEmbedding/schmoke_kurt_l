pledge to increase funding for the citys school system decides to save money by doing what previous mayors have tried to do and failed close several of the citys older fire stations widely considered to be unnecessary given the capabilities of modern fire fighting apparatus as a black mayor poised to close stations in white workingclass neighborhoods however schmoke must decide how to make the news public among his options an address to the city at large a message to the city council an announcement by the fire chief this case about communication as an aspect of political strategy is

university of baltimore president kurt l schmokedecision makerskurt l schmokeuniversity of baltimore presidentfocus on the law at ublawalison rajk baltimore mdalison rajkbaltimore mdsupportersthe students of the university of baltimore school of law have made it clear that the purpose of our law school building seems to have been lost somewhere during its first three years of operation  it’s understood amongst the students of ub law that our building must remain accessible to the public  however it is a point of confusion for many if not all students as to why the importance of public access is superior to the importance of law students being able to safely and comfortably pursue our legal education our building is open to the public to help facilitate the access of students faculty clinic clients guests and law library users  it is not a public restroom  it is not a public hang out space  it is not a space for people to congregate just because it’s cold outside  it is not a place for people to come to when they are tired and want to nap  as a student body we should be able to come to school and feel safe  we should be able to access our school building a place we utilize for furthering our educational and professional pursuits without feeling uncomfortable or insecure it is time that the university of baltimore recognizes that the focus of this building must be the safety security and success of its law students – anything less is insufficient and not conducive to the study of law here at the university i am only one student of hundreds here at the university of baltimore school of law  i am only one student but i am not the only student who feels that the security issues in our building need to be reassessed  so here i am a single student willing to speak on behalf of my fellow students to encourage taking the steps toward necessary and meaningful change – change that will benefit all students  past present and future we need to make this building safer and in order to do that i need your help  it is my goal to make this building a safer and more comfortable learning environment for everyone  i believe that the best way to do this is by regulating public access to the building at all times  i believe that the most reasonable way to regulate public access is to make it mandatory that all people entering the building must be asked to show photo identification during business hours  after business hours i would like to see that the building be restricted to bee card access only  please sign this petition to show your support for making our law school building a safer place to be  it’s time we as a student body make our concerns and opinions known to the decision makers here at the university of baltimore  this
