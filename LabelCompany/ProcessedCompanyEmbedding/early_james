bagless vacuum cleaner which works on the principle of cyclonic separation according to the sunday times rich list  his net worth is £ billion he served as the provost of the royal college of art from august  to july  contents  early life and education  early inventions  vacuum cleaners  other inventions  manufacturing  european single currency  james dyson foundation  honours and awards  personal life  references  external links early life and educationedit james dyson was born in cromer norfolk one of three children he was educated at greshams school an independent boarding school in holt norfolk from  to  when his father died of cancer he excelled at long distance running i was quite good at it not because i was physically good but because i had more determination i learnt determination from it he spent one year – at the byam shaw school of art and then studied furniture and interior design at the royal college of art – before moving into engineering early inventionsedit dyson helped design the sea truck in  while studying at the royal college of art his first original invention the ballbarrow was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel this was featured on the bbcs tomorrows world television programme dyson stuck with the idea of a ball which his brother had thought of inventing the trolleyball a trolley that launched boats he then designed the wheelboat which could travel at speeds of  kilometres per hour  mph on both land and water vacuum cleanersedit dc bagless dyson vacuum cleaner in the late s dyson had the idea of using cyclonic separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt he became frustrated with his hoover juniors diminishing performance the dust bag kept becoming clogged with loads of dust thus reducing suction the cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology qv history of dyson ltd partly supported by his wifes salary as an art teacher and after five years and many prototypes dyson launched the gforce cleaner in  however no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the uk as it would disturb the valuable market for replacement dust bags so dyson launched it in japan through catalogue sales manufactured in bright pink the gforce sold for the equivalent of £ it won the  international design fair prize in japan he obtained his first us patent on the idea in  us patent  after failing to sell his invention to the major manufacturers dyson set up his own manufacturing company dyson ltd in june  he opened his research centre and factory in malmesbury wiltshire dysons breakthrough in the uk market came more than ten years after the initial idea through a tv advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that unlike most of its rivals the dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags at that time the uk market for disposable cleaner bags was £ million the slogan say goodbye to the bag proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers ironically the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag – users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience the dyson dual cyclone became the fastestselling vacuum cleaner ever made in the uk and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea becoming one of the most popular brands in the uk in early  it was reported that dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the united states by value though not by number of units sold dyson licensed the technology in north america from  to  to fantom technologies after which dyson entered the market directly following his success other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners in  dyson sued hoover uk for patent infringement the high court ruled that hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its triple vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range hoover agreed to pay damages of £ million in  dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner creating the dyson ball with the aim of making it more manoeuvrable in mid dyson personally appeared in tokyo to introduce his  eye robotic vacuum cleaner dysons initial entry into this market segment features ° scanning and mapping for navigation cyclonic dust separation a customdesigned digital motor for high suction tank treads for traction a fullwidth beater bar and user interface via a free ios or android app other inventionsedit in  dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the contrarotator which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions the range was decorated in the usual bright dyson colours rather than the traditional white grey or black of most other machines the item was not a commercial success and is no longer available in  dyson created a realisation of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of dutch artist m c escher engineer derek phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp the creation titled wrong garden was displayed at the chelsea flower show in  the illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down this makes it appear that the water is flowing up when really a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer dyson airblade hand dryer in october  dyson launched the dyson airblade a fast hand dryer that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat this allows faster drying while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers another product is a fan without external blades which he calls the air multiplier in addition to a cooling fan a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available in april  dyson launched the dyson supersonic a hair dryer with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size as well as quieter operation commenting on the launch vogue magazine said as the first product to launch from dysons new uk stateoftheart hair laboratory we have high hopes for the future of our blowdries manufacturingedit in february  dyson announced that production was being shifted to malaysia leaving  workers redundant in  for economic reasons and because of difficulty acquiring land for expansion the companys headquarters and research facilities remain in malmesbury in november  dyson announced plans to invest a further £bn into the research and development of new technology including funding for a campus at the dyson uk headquarters in malmesbury which will create up to  jobs former prime minister david cameron said “dyson is a great british success story and the expansion of the malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families investment on this scale shows confidence in our longterm economic plan to back business create more jobs and secure a brighter future for britain” european single currencyedit dyson demonstrating his contrarotator washing machine in  dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of the twenty ftse  companies who signed a statement published in the financial times in  calling on the government for early british membership of the eurozone he claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the british manufacturing base and said it does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longerterm future of britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save an editorial published by the times responded mr dyson a manufacturing version of sir richard branson likes complaining yesterday he was complaining that britains failure to join the euro and the resultant strong pound will force him to move abroad last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in wiltshire but never mind so where will he go to portugal italy or to an eu candidate such as poland no mr dyson threatens to go to the far east like so many entrepreneurs he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates but also low inflation low wages a flexible labour market and low regulation he will not find them in the eurozone lord tebbit a former secretary of state for trade and industry also questioned dysons motives and said what still puzzles me is why such a euroenthusiast as mr dyson does not intend to establish his new factory in europe if he cant have it in britain in  dyson said he would now be voting to leave the european union to avoid being dominated and bullied by the germans in november  dyson lost his case against eu energy labelling laws in the european court of justice

technologies and other productsedit dyson has developed various technologies in their products such as the dual cyclone used in vacuum cleaners and their airblade hand dryers digital motoredit the dyson digital motor is a dc electric motor operates on the switched reluctance principle used in several pieces of equipment according to dyson it is smaller lighter cleaner and more powerefficient due in part to tight tolerances than conventional electric motors these brushless motors rotate at up to  rpm the motor is a twopole brushless motor with a digital controller dyson says efficiency is  which is less than the  efficiency that is achieved in some brushless designs in order to deal with the high speed the impeller is made of carbonfibre reinforced polymer the shaft is steel the first version was named x and used in the airblade hand dryer the later ddm dyson digital motor v is used for dyson handheld vacuum cleaners airblade hand dryeredit main article dyson airblade dyson airblade view from top the dyson airblade is a hand dryer for commercial customers typically made available in public handwashing facilities the airblade uses dysons digital motor to produce a stream of air that flows at up to  mph  kmh and is claimed to dry the hands in  to  seconds the airblade uses a hepa filter to remove bacteria and mould from the air the dyson airblade is the worlds first hygienic commercial hand dryer according to nsf international it is accredited by the british skin foundation and the royal institute of public health as well the dyson airblade is haccp approved the first dyson airblade was launched in  bladeless fansedit air multiplieredit display of a range of dyson air multipliers the dyson air multiplier was announced on  october  as an electric fan intended to provide smoother airflow and having no exposed rotating blades operating in a safer manner than conventional bladed fans like other bladeless fans the apparatus itself has no visible external blades as the fan blades are concealed within the body of the product the fan works by drawing  litres of air per second in through an inlet in the base pillar and forcing it through an outlet in the upper ring the jet of air travels over the airfoil shape of the ring creating local low pressure thereby pulling air from behind it as it decelerates in a process known as inducement a property of bernoullis principle once the air exits the ring it entrains the air in front and alongside producing an airflow of  lsecond using this process a small brushless impeller in the fans base can power a much larger air outlet without exposing any blades dyson stated that the initially generated air flow is multiplied between  and  times for the models am am and am projecting a smooth stream of uninterrupted air in march  the secondgeneration models of the air multiplier were acoustically reengineered so that the bladeless fans were quieter than their predecessors by improved airflow and a helmholtz resonator to cancel a  khz whine since the original release dyson has produced combination electrical heater and cooling fans some with hepa filters based on its air multiplier design in addition some newer designs have the ability to shift between a wider and shallower or a narrower but fartherreaching stream of air under user control most of the dyson fans and heaters are controlled by small infrared remote controls which can be adhered magnetically to the appliance when not in use a more limited set of control switches is available on the body of the appliance the design for a bladeless fan was patented by toshiba in  but was never manufactured the initial patent claim by dyson was rejected by the intellectual property office ruling that it cannot be considered novel or cannot be considered to involve an inventive step compared to the japanese version the air multiplier fan received the good design award in  fan heateredit in september  dyson announced the dyson hot fan heater am using air multiplier technology like most fan heaters it has a thermostat to control the temperature and can also be used as a fan without heat all am models made prior to  april  were subject to a nocharge product recall for repairs because of a fire risk ultrasonic humidifieredit in march  dyson released their new air multiplier humidifier it uses ultraviolet cleanse technology to clean water by running it through ultraviolet light twice before it is released a piezoelectric transducer in the base vibrates up to  million times a second to break the water down into small particles which are drawn up and added to the air with air multiplier technology air purifieredit in january  dyson released the dyson pure cool air purifier it uses the same air multiplier technology to blow air as well as a  micron hepa filter to trap air particles along with the filter to trap slow particles the unit uses lowforce velocity to trap fine particles within the filter as well contrarotator washing machineedit the discontinued dyson cr contrarotator is a washing machine with two counterrotating drums the first of its type each drum had  spin perforations to help evacuate water the machine was first available in november  dysons next washing machine in  was the cr with flowcheck and allergy models the company later stopped making washing machines the same year as they were unprofitable for the company as of november  dyson no longer supports or services the contrarotator washing machines which it has officially declared obsolete hair dryeredit on  april  dyson introduced the supersonic handheld hair dryer the digital motor v is housed in the handle lightingedit in  dyson introduced the csys range of led lamps the lamps incorporate heat pipe technology designed to extend the life of the product vacuum cleanersedit root cyclone technologyedit the dyson root cyclone technology is used in all dyson vacuum cleaners from dc the dc dc and dc use the improved root cyclone  core separator also called radix cyclone intermediary cyclone or level  root cyclone technology model versionsedit all versions are identified by a name such as dc some have submodels identified by a suffix indicating specific facilities implemented sometimes by additional tools supplied suffixes with the same meaning vary from model to model all floors multi floor woodwool suitable for both hard surfaces and carpets allergy suitable for filtering out microscopic allergens animal will pick up animal hairs better than a generalpurpose model and filter out fine particles these machines all come with a mini turbine tool to help remove pet hair human hair and cotton fibres from upholstery cars and confined areas motorhead cylinder model with motorised brush head full gear same features as animal with more attachments special edition modelsedit other suffixes sometimes used indicate exclusivity to certain stores eg comet exclusive and overdrive comet or blitz it currys some are limited editions drawing limited editionsedit these machines feature a different range of tools to the usual multifloor and animal versions and also appear in different colours the drawing later became exclusive to john lewis de stijl limited editionsedit some of the early dyson models dc dc dc were available in a special limited edition de stijl colour scheme in homage to the dutch design movement of the same name all these are coloured a combination of purple red and yellow dyson antarctic solo limited editionsedit in   recolored dc and dc models were produced as part of a fundraising effort for ranulph fienness solo expedition to the antarctic for these models the yellow parts found on the mainstream models were replaced with light blue ones and on the dc antarctic solo the body was also recoloured in white instead of silver discontinued modelsedit gforceedit gforce was the name given to dysons first widely available vacuum cleaner it was the first to use dual cyclone separation technology licensed to the japanese company apex inc and only available on the japanese market it was not sold under the dyson name dyson used the money he earned from gforce to start up the dyson company dcedit the first vacuum cleaner sold under the dyson name was the da launched in  it was a domestic upright model that used the patented dual cyclone technology and was made in chippenham england after a short period it was renamed the dc and production later moved to malmesbury at the companys new factoryresearch centre the dc had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of brush control where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors it stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used this was the only dyson upright not to use washable premotor filters these had to be purchased and replaced every  months it also had a choice of post motor filtration – standard or hepa high efficiency particle arrest according to the model purchased it competed with models like the hoover turbopower and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners the suction power of the dc is  airwatts dyson no longer supports this model nor produces parts for it dcedit the dc launched in  was the first cylinder canister model sold by dyson its shape allowed it to sit on stairs like the dc it used dual cyclone technology it was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the dc the dc is no longer supported by dyson the dc was available in several special editions the de stijl was colored purple red and yellow in homage to the dutch art movement from which it takes its name it was produced in a limited edition of  units the dc clear was produced in clear blue and green plastic allowing the user to see its internal components through the casing the antarctica solo model coloured white and pale blue helped raise funds for the breakthrough cancer charity whilst commemorating sir ranulph fienness solo trek across antarctica each of the limited edition run of  machines bore the image of ranulph fienness autograph the recyclone was the first vacuum cleaner to be made of recycled plastic originally intended as a testrun for a rangewide recyclone scheme the concept never went beyond a very small production run of dcs they were coloured green with organic pigment dcedit the dc dysons second upright vacuum cleaner released in  was a lightweight  kg low profile upright cleaner it resembled a twincylinder version of the dc contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of hepa filters the dc had a smaller more compact w motor and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around  airwatts its heavyduty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original cyclone cleaners were discontinued it was the first upright model to feature brush control via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll and was able to be stored hung on a wall it was also the first dyson to have the reversible hose like on the dc and dc ball dcedit the dc released around  had improved filters fitted as standard the pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushbar introduced on the dc dcedit the dc launched in  was the second cylinder model it was designed as a replacement for the dc the motorhead version was the first dyson to offer a powernozzle a floor nozzle with a motorpowered brushroll for improved performance on carpets dcedit dysons first robotic vacuum cleaner equipped with the dyson digital motor had not proceeded beyond the hometrial stage by  as cost and weight needed reducing it had the ability to learn the room and to distinguish between solid objects such as walls and furniture and human beings pets etc by utilising sensors and speciallywritten navigation software dyson dc got introduced in  dcedit dc origin dyson vacuum cleaner the dc released in  was the first implementation of root cyclone technology into a cleaner in features it was similar to the dc but included a bottom drop bin controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing which made for easier emptying and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle so making it easier to use than that on the dc many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars the dc had a new w motor that provided  airwatts making it about the most powerful model that dyson made and also the noisiest in use with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly it weighed  kg in the us the dyson dc was sold only at target the dc had a long production run from  until  and came in many different colour combinations dcedit the dc was a new cylinder revision released around  incorporating the dyson root cyclone technology found on the dc the dc was the replacement for the dc it was the first of the dyson cylinder models to feature the new animal derivative first seen on the dc which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal on carpets and furnishings – they also came equipped with hepa post motor filters none of the dc models had electric motorised floorheads like the dc the dc was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power handled by the new root  cyclone system the dc was equipped with this higher power output was able to drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the dc motorhead had lower models in the dc range did not come with the turbine floorhead having only the standard floorheads which were better suited to hard flooring than carpets unlike the dc the dc did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner as with the dc tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose the dc had a long production run it was upgraded to the dc telescope wrap after the launch of the dc to enable it to be stored more efficiently and was eventually superseded by the dc dctedit next product after the dc with telescope wrap wand handle is telescopic and the hose wraps around the machine launched in  dc dc dc omittededit there are no dyson models dc as the numbers are associated with the dc and dc aircraft produced by mcdonnell douglas dc omitted due to superstition surrounding the number  dcedit the dc was the first dyson cylinder cleaner with telescope wrap launched around  it had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away it was only available in two variants one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoiseaqua model the dc was quickly superseded by the dct telescope wrap and not produced for very long dcedit small cylinder machine released in japanlaunched near  dcplusedit small cylinders in japan topoftherange models are fitted with the dyson digital motor which rotates at  rpm dcedit the dc was released in  it is a revision of the dc upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and telescope reach it uses dysons root  cyclone technology which maintains constant suction aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin the dc looks very similar to the dc it also has the same motor as fitted to the dc and the same floorhead with the exception that the dc has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design the dc was slightly quieter in operation than the dc was but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same  watt motor like the dc the dc comes in many variants the standard dc the origin non clutched the all floors clutched the allergy clutched the animal clutched  mini turbine tool and other special editions and colourways as of january update listed as end of line on dyson web site dcedit the dc known as the ball was released in  in three variants the dc all floors allergy and animal it was the first of the many ball vacuums and is based on the dc it has a ball instead of wheels which in conjunction with a universal joint on the cleaner head makes it possible to steer the machine by twisting the handle to the right or left the inspiration of the ball system originated from the ballbarrow james dysons first invention the dc is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models and is the first dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll controlled by a switch next to the main power switch the main suction motor is housed inside the ball due to its high launch price its weight  kilograms  lb and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick not that many dcs were sold with the cheaper dc remaining much more popular the lightweight dc was launched late the following year addressing the dcs biggest criticism its heavy weight dc – dyson handheldedit dc handheld cyclonic vacuum cleaner the dc is dysons first handheld vacuum cleaner based on the same technology as used in the dc and dc root cyclone upright vacuum cleaners the dc has  airwatts of constant suction the dc shares the same styling as the other recent upright and cylinder vacuum cleaners in the dyson range and weighs  kg  lb also available in an issey miyake limited edition in which the manifold on the cyclone assembly is pink instead of the standard yellow and an animal version with a motorised brushbar for picking up pet hair and gold cyclone manifold newest to the range is the dc car and boat which is designed for car and boat cleaning supplied with a car  v charger and has a blue cyclone manifold launched in  dcedit the dyson dc is an upright cleaner launched in october  in the us although visually similar to the dc it contains new technologies the first upgrade is the use of dysons level  root cyclone this system incorporates  cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream in this system the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system beyond that the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream the level  root cyclone improves upon the original root cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow a problem with the earlier system the second change with the dc upright is the brushroll design while the brushrolls used on the dc dc and dc were designed with european carpets in mind the dcs brush roll was designed for north america with a cylindrical shape a large diameter and short stiff bristles a separate motor drives the brushroll unlike the dc and dc which use power from the main motor via clutches this made the dc the most effective of dyson cleaners on carpeting the third change is a new colour scheme for the dc and also the dyson dc root  handheld the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and titanium as the main colour for the entire machine the level  root cyclone system on the dc was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cyclones backwards clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction almost all of the original dcs had this problem the redesigned cyclone pack fitted to later dcs resolved this issue older dcs were not recalled but dyson gave out and sold many of the redesigned cyclone packscitation needed dcedit the  kilograms  lb dyson dc slim launched in september  and produced until summer  is a slimmer and lighterweight successor of the dc ball upright the dcs root cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machines slimmer profile the dc uses  cyclones the dc  the ball design has been simplified for the dc rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor the dc rides on a thin cigarshaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths dcedit cylinder model without the telescopic wrap system it was the replacement of the dc and to all intents and purposes is virtually the same in appearance and design as the dc dc tedit same as dc but improved so that the brushbar can pick up on carpets and on hard floors this model also used a plastic telescopic rod instead of the metal one found on the original dc still a current model as of november  dcedit stowaway as dc but with telescope wrap dyson have updated the dct part of the dc series to form the dc called the dyson stowaway in the uk the colour scheme is new and the cleaner is available in standard allergy and animal dcedit entering into the american market in  this model is known as the stowaway in the united states but as the motorhead in the united kingdom and other countries it is the second cylinder vacuum from dyson to have a motorised brushbar on the head of the nozzle it is an advance on the dc telescopic wrap system discontinued in some countries including the united kingdom dcedit known as dyson baby or dyson compact or dyson allergy and twothirds the size of the dc using the dyson digital motor and core separation which adds a third cyclone layer to filter out smaller particles has turbine head and motor head versions dcedit dc is similar in design to the dc but uses the new core separation that is also in the dc there is also a turbinehead animal version in canada dc tedit a dc with different accessories and tools dcedit a small version of the dc also uses ball technology with separate brushroll motor it weighs  kilogrammes  pounds and has  airwatts of suction power it is small and compact and the handle compacts further for easy storage it appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner like the dc this model has proved to be a big seller due to its extremely compact size but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors some of which have failed prematurely was superseded by the dc in november  dcedit the dc is a full size ball upright the replacement for the dc and dc a nolossofsuction vacuum features a lifetime washable high efficiency particulate air hepa filter the dc and the other upright vacuums from dyson are the only vacuum on the market that has been certified asthma and allergy friendly by the asthma and allergy foundation of america it is available as all floors yellow animal purple overdrive blue blitz it red exclusive silver and blueprint white and blue this vacuum is very similar to the dc but on a smaller size addressing issues brought up with the dc proved to be a very popular ball cleaner more so than the dc and the dc which was not a true ball model superseded in mid by the dc and dc animal dcedit ultra compact cylinder model the dc known as the dyson city is the worlds smallest vacuum with constant suction even smaller than the dc the machine is so small that it will fit onto a piece of a paper with a very small dust container of  litres and cord length of  metres it was designed for small flats with primarily hard floors it weighs just  kg and has an impressive  airwatts suction power dcedit the dc is an update on the dc the dc is a full size upright which has wheels rather than a ball an autoadjusting cleaner head and rootcyclone technology it also features an extending wand and hose and has a large debris channel to pick up large dirt particles dcedit this was another upright model produced for the us market it was the replacement for the dc has a powered cam to adjust the height of the brushbar dyson airmuscle controlled from a set of buttons by the main power switch above the cyclone assembly a pneumatic actuator to keep the cleaning head on the floor and a hightorque clutch to give extra power to the brushbar dcedit in australia the dc is a cylinder model an improved version of dc very similar to dct the main differences being colour and tooling and nonhepa machine a hepa filter is now included in  multifloor white models in canada the dc is actually an upright model similar to the dc this appears to be the first instance of a particular model number being used on an upright or a cylinder depending on country of destination supplied to continental europe and australia cylinder type and canada upright type not available in the uk according to this dyson review listing on the australian website the dyson dc multi floor is no longer available dcedit powerful handheld with a brushless switched reluctance motor can provide  minutes of high and constant suction it is smaller lighter and more powerful than the dc which uses a conventional motor the dc has a yellow cyclone manifold dcedit the most powerful handheld with the same motor technology as the dc but with a larger battery and dual power for more runtime  minutes of high constant suction at the same level as the dc or  minutes with  higher suction available as dc with a blue uk and aus yellow us or red eu cyclone manifold or the dc animal which has a purple cyclone manifold dcedit dyson dc basically the same as dct in the uk with a revised color scheme and additional tooling models current as of december edit this section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information december  dcedit revised version of the dcdc replacement for the dc upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology available as multi floor yellow stubborn white animal purple i red the dc has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the dc so attachments from older dysons such as the dc do not fit the dc this model more closely resembles the old dc than the dc did using exactly the same style of floorhead as the dc dc and dc the plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more without the support of the metal wandcitation needed the fact that older models tools were not interchangeable was also criticised with many buyers trading up from the dc or dc to the dc and finding that their old tools would not fitcitation needed the dc uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the dc dc and dc this unit has been discontinued as of july  no replacement model has been announced in mainland europe the dcc is a cylinder machine known as the allergy musclehead dcedit another handheld model similar to the dc launched in  dcedit dyson dc cordless vacuum dyson digital slim similar design to the dc but with detachable extension tube modified electronics and motorised brush head launched in  it is being replaced by dyson v cordless vacuum dcedit dc version for japan france south korea and canada dcedit dyson dc dc version for continental europe and canada dcedit smaller version of the dc dcedit dysons new cylinder vacuum cleaner released in late  it uses dysons radial root cyclone technology

has multifloor and animal editions that utilise the dyson ball technology dcedit the dyson dc upright released in late  as the replacement for the dc is the first upright vacuum with dysons new radial root cyclone technology as well as an automatic height adjuster which provides the maximum amount of power in the suction head the cleaner also has dysons new highpowered turbo brush for the hose the dc uses ball technology dcedit a version of the dyson dc offered for sale in canada dcedit a version of the dyson dc offered for sale in canada dcedit the dyson digital slim dc is dysons newest handheld vacuum cleaner which uses the same motorised brush head as the dc as well as the radial root cyclone technology has an extension pole to make it similar to a cylinder cleaners handle pole and floorhead improves on the dc by incorporating a more powerful brush bar motor and having more cleaning tools it is being replaced by dyson v motor head cordless vacuum dcedit dyson digital slim for canada and continental europe essentially the same as the dc dcedit version of the dc cylinder model for the canadian and the japanese market dcedit the dc was released at the end of  and is an update on the dc it is a compact cylinder model based on the technologies featured on the dc but introducing the new  tier radial root cyclone technology for greater suction and filtration and also the new  channel floor tool it weighs  kg and has a suction power of  airwatts dcedit version of the dc cylinder model for the canadian and the japanese market launched in  dcedit updated dc with more compact design and using the new digital motor v billed by dyson as its smallest and quietest vacuum cleaner dcedit the dc was released at the end of  and is an update on the dc it is a very small and lightweight upright ball cleaner incorporating the technologies introduced on the dc ie selfadjusting brushroll plus the addition of a new brushroll motor mounted inside the brushroll to save on space the brushroll also incorporates carbon fibre bristles found in the dc and dc models it weighs  kg  lbs and has a suction rating of  airwatts with a dirt capacity of  litres also featuring the  tier radial cyclone system found on the dc in canada it is called the dc dcedit a lightweight upright model with two tiers of smaller cyclones dcedit version of the dc cylinder model for continental europe and singapore dcedit newest ball vacuum cleaner from dyson it uses cinetic technology which dyson says will not lose suction over  years it is the first dyson that does not require cleaning of filters consists of  cyclones with high frequency oscillating tips that vibrate to prevent clogging comes in animal and multifloor versions where it bundles a range of cleaning tools to tackle all surface types dcedit cordless handheld powered by dyson digital motor v has  cyclones weighs  pounds  kg including a v rechargeable lithium ion battery dcedit handheld powered by dyson digital motor v has  cyclones dcedit the dc replaces the dc and is claimed to remove as much dust as a corded vacuum this is made possible by the combination of the dyson digital motor v  tier radial cyclones and the latest floor tool with carbon fibre filaments this powerdense motor uses digital pulse technology and a neodymium magnet to spin at up to  times a minute its small size means that the machines it powers can also be small light and powerful dcedit for specific markets eg singapore based on the v handheld version very similar to the dc dcedit for specific markets eg canada singapore continental europe based on the v very similar to the dc dcedit dc is a small ball vacuum launched in it powered by the dyson digital motor v it has  tier radial root cyclones dcedit the dc dc in canada—released in early —is an update of the dc the vacuum features an updated root cyclone and a redesigned brush roll with more power than the dc and a better edge cleaning system it also includes the same

of engineering  website dysoncouk jamesdysonawardorg jamesdysonfoundationcom sir james dyson om cbe frs freng born  may  is a british inventor industrial designer and founder of the dyson company he is best known as the inventor of the dual cyclone bagless vacuum cleaner which works on the principle of cyclonic separation according to the sunday times rich list  his net worth is £ billion he served as the provost of the royal college of art from august  to july  contents  early life and education  early inventions  vacuum cleaners  other inventions  manufacturing  european single currency  james dyson foundation  honours and awards  personal life  references  external links early life and educationedit james dyson was born in cromer norfolk one of three children he was educated at greshams school an independent boarding school in holt norfolk from  to  when his father died of cancer he excelled at long distance running i was quite good at it not because i was physically good but because i had more determination i learnt determination from it he spent one year – at the byam shaw school of art and then studied furniture and interior design at the royal college of art – before moving into engineering early inventionsedit dyson helped design the sea truck in  while studying at the royal college of art his first original invention the ballbarrow was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel this was featured on the bbcs tomorrows world television programme dyson stuck with the idea of a ball which his brother had thought of inventing the trolleyball a trolley that launched boats he then designed the wheelboat which could travel at speeds of  kilometres per hour  mph on both land and water vacuum cleanersedit dc bagless dyson vacuum cleaner in the late s dyson had the idea of using cyclonic separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt he became frustrated with his hoover juniors diminishing performance the dust bag kept becoming clogged with loads of dust thus reducing suction the cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology qv history of dyson ltd partly supported by his wifes salary as an art teacher and after five years and many prototypes dyson launched the gforce cleaner in  however no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the uk as it would disturb the valuable market for replacement dust bags so dyson launched it in japan through catalogue sales manufactured in bright pink the gforce sold for the equivalent of £ it won the  international design fair prize in japan he obtained his first us patent on the idea in  us patent  after failing to sell his invention to the major manufacturers dyson set up his own manufacturing company dyson ltd in june  he opened his research centre and factory in malmesbury wiltshire dysons breakthrough in the uk market came more than ten years after the initial idea through a tv advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that unlike most of its rivals the dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags at that time the uk market for disposable cleaner bags was £ million the slogan say goodbye to the bag proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers ironically the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag – users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience the dyson dual cyclone became the fastestselling vacuum cleaner ever made in the uk and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea becoming one of the most popular brands in the uk in early  it was reported that dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the united states by value though not by number of units sold dyson licensed the technology in north america from  to  to fantom technologies after which dyson entered the market directly following his success other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners in  dyson sued hoover uk for patent infringement the high court ruled that hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its triple vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range hoover agreed to pay damages of £ million in  dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner creating the dyson ball with the aim of making it more manoeuvrable in mid dyson personally appeared in tokyo to introduce his  eye robotic vacuum cleaner dysons initial entry into this market segment features ° scanning and mapping for navigation cyclonic dust separation a customdesigned digital motor for high suction tank treads for traction a fullwidth beater bar and user interface via a free ios or android app other inventionsedit in  dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the contrarotator which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions the range was decorated in the usual bright dyson colours rather than the traditional white grey or black of most other machines the item was not a commercial success and is no longer available in  dyson created a realisation of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of dutch artist m c escher engineer derek phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp the creation titled wrong garden was displayed at the chelsea flower show in  the illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down this makes it appear that the water is flowing up when really a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer dyson airblade hand dryer in october  dyson launched the dyson airblade a fast hand dryer that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat this allows faster drying while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers another product is a fan without external blades which he calls the air multiplier in addition to a cooling fan a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available in april  dyson launched the dyson supersonic a hair dryer with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size as well as quieter operation commenting on the launch vogue magazine said as the first product to launch from dysons new uk stateoftheart hair laboratory we have high hopes for the future of our blowdries manufacturingedit in february  dyson announced that production was being shifted to malaysia leaving  workers redundant in  for economic reasons and because of difficulty acquiring land for expansion the companys headquarters and research facilities remain in malmesbury in november  dyson announced plans to invest a further £bn into the research and development of new technology including funding for a campus at the dyson uk headquarters in malmesbury which will create up to  jobs former prime minister david cameron said “dyson is a great british success story and the expansion of the malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families investment on this scale shows confidence in our longterm economic plan to back business create more jobs and secure a brighter future for britain” european single currencyedit dyson demonstrating his contrarotator washing machine in  dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of the twenty ftse  companies who signed a statement published in the financial times in  calling on the government for early british membership of the eurozone he claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the british manufacturing base and said it does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longerterm future of britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save an editorial published by the times responded mr dyson a manufacturing version of sir richard branson likes complaining yesterday he was complaining that britains failure to join the euro and the resultant strong pound will force him to move abroad last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in wiltshire but never mind so where will he go to portugal italy or to an eu candidate such as poland no mr dyson threatens to go to the far east like so many entrepreneurs he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates but also low inflation low wages a flexible labour market and low regulation he will not find them in the eurozone lord tebbit a former secretary of state for trade and industry also questioned dysons motives and said what still puzzles me is why such a euroenthusiast as mr dyson does not intend to establish his new factory in europe if he cant have it in britain in  dyson said he would now be voting to leave the european union to avoid being dominated and bullied by the germans in november  dyson lost his case against eu energy labelling laws in the european court of justice dyson was one of the most prominent uk business leaders to publicly support brexit before the referendum in june  since the eu referendum dyson has stated that britain should leave the eu single market and that this would liberate the uk economy james dyson foundationedit dyson in  at sydney australia dyson set up the foundation in  to support design and engineering education – it now operates in uk us and japan the foundations aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes the foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities it achieves this by funding different resources such as the engineering box a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid the foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge they are suitable for key stage  and above the engineering box enables students to take apart and examine a dyson dc telescope vacuum cleaner in addition a school is allowed to retain a james dyson foundation teacher pack and a copy of genius of britain a channel  tv series featuring dyson and design engineering posters other resources are also available in may  the foundation announced an £m donation to create a technology hub at the university of cambridge a new fourstorey building will house  postgraduate engineers and support worldleading research the donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students in march  the james dyson foundation pledged a £m donation to imperial college london to allow the purchase of an iconic post office building located on exhibition road from the science museum imperial college will open the dyson school of design engineering in this building and teach a new fouryear masters course in design engineering developing a new cohort of creative and theoretical engineers the foundation also supports the work of young designers through the james dyson award this is an

technologies and other productsedit dyson has developed various technologies in their products such as the dual cyclone used in vacuum cleaners and their airblade hand dryers digital motoredit the dyson digital motor is a dc electric motor operates on the switched reluctance principle used in several pieces of equipment according to dyson it is smaller lighter cleaner and more powerefficient due in part to tight tolerances than conventional electric motors these brushless motors rotate at up to  rpm the motor is a twopole brushless motor with a digital controller dyson says efficiency is  which is less than the  efficiency that is achieved in some brushless designs in order to deal with the high speed the impeller is made of carbonfibre reinforced polymer the shaft is steel the first version was named x and used in the airblade hand dryer the later ddm dyson digital motor v is used for dyson handheld vacuum cleaners airblade hand dryeredit main article dyson airblade dyson airblade view from top the dyson airblade is a hand dryer for commercial customers typically made available in public handwashing facilities the airblade uses dysons digital motor to produce a stream of air that flows at up to  mph  kmh and is claimed to dry the hands in  to  seconds the airblade uses a hepa filter to remove bacteria and mould from the air the dyson airblade is the worlds first hygienic commercial hand dryer according to nsf international it is accredited by the british skin foundation and the royal institute of public health as well the dyson airblade is haccp approved the first dyson airblade was launched in  bladeless fansedit air multiplieredit display of a range of dyson air multipliers the dyson air multiplier was announced on  october  as an electric fan intended to provide smoother airflow and having no exposed rotating blades operating in a safer manner than conventional bladed fans like other bladeless fans the apparatus itself has no visible external blades as the fan blades are concealed within the body of the product the fan works by drawing  litres of air per second in through an inlet in the base pillar and forcing it through an outlet in the upper ring the jet of air travels over the airfoil shape of the ring creating local low pressure thereby pulling air from behind it as it decelerates in a process known as inducement a property of bernoullis principle once the air exits the ring it entrains the air in front and alongside producing an airflow of  lsecond using this process a small brushless impeller in the fans base can power a much larger air outlet without exposing any blades dyson stated that the initially generated air flow is multiplied between  and  times for the models am am and am projecting a smooth stream of uninterrupted air in march  the secondgeneration models of the air multiplier were acoustically reengineered so that the bladeless fans were quieter than their predecessors by improved airflow and a helmholtz resonator to cancel a  khz whine since the original release dyson has produced combination electrical heater and cooling fans some with hepa filters based on its air multiplier design in addition some newer designs have the ability to shift between a wider and shallower or a narrower but fartherreaching stream of air under user control most of the dyson fans and heaters are controlled by small infrared remote controls which can be adhered magnetically to the appliance when not in use a more limited set of control switches is available on the body of the appliance the design for a bladeless fan was patented by toshiba in  but was never manufactured the initial patent claim by dyson was rejected by the intellectual property office ruling that it cannot be considered novel or cannot be considered to involve an inventive step compared to the japanese version the air multiplier fan received the good design award in  fan heateredit in september  dyson announced the dyson hot fan heater am using air multiplier technology like most fan heaters it has a thermostat to control the temperature and can also be used as a fan without heat all am models made prior to  april  were subject to a nocharge product recall for repairs because of a fire risk ultrasonic humidifieredit in march  dyson released their new air multiplier humidifier it uses ultraviolet cleanse technology to clean water by running it through ultraviolet light twice before it is released a piezoelectric transducer in the base vibrates up to  million times a second to break the water down into small particles which are drawn up and added to the air with air multiplier technology air purifieredit in january  dyson released the dyson pure cool air purifier it uses the same air multiplier technology to blow air as well as a  micron hepa filter to trap air particles along with the filter to trap slow particles the unit uses lowforce velocity to trap fine particles within the filter as well contrarotator washing machineedit the discontinued dyson cr contrarotator is a washing machine with two counterrotating drums the first of its type each drum had  spin perforations to help evacuate water the machine was first available in november  dysons next washing machine in  was the cr with flowcheck and allergy models the company later stopped making washing machines the same year as they were unprofitable for the company as of november  dyson no longer supports or services the contrarotator washing machines which it has officially declared obsolete hair dryeredit on  april  dyson introduced the supersonic handheld hair dryer the digital motor v is housed in the handle lightingedit in  dyson introduced the csys range of led lamps the lamps incorporate heat pipe technology designed to extend the life of the product vacuum cleanersedit root cyclone technologyedit the dyson root cyclone technology is used in all dyson vacuum cleaners from dc the dc dc and dc use the improved root cyclone  core separator also called radix cyclone intermediary cyclone or level  root cyclone technology model versionsedit all versions are identified by a name such as dc some have submodels identified by a suffix indicating specific facilities implemented sometimes by additional tools supplied suffixes with the same meaning vary from model to model all floors multi floor woodwool suitable for both hard surfaces and carpets allergy suitable for filtering out microscopic allergens animal will pick up animal hairs better than a generalpurpose model and filter out fine particles these machines all come with a mini turbine tool to help remove pet hair human hair and cotton fibres from upholstery cars and confined areas motorhead cylinder model with motorised brush head full gear same features as animal with more attachments special edition modelsedit other suffixes sometimes used indicate exclusivity to certain stores eg comet exclusive and overdrive comet or blitz it currys some are limited editions drawing limited editionsedit these machines feature a different range of tools to the usual multifloor and animal versions and also appear in different colours the drawing later became exclusive to john lewis de stijl limited editionsedit some of the early dyson models dc dc dc were available in a special limited edition de stijl colour scheme in homage to the dutch design movement of the same name all these are coloured a combination of purple red and yellow dyson antarctic solo limited editionsedit in   recolored dc and dc models were produced as part of a fundraising effort for ranulph fienness solo expedition to the antarctic for these models the yellow parts found on the mainstream models were replaced with light blue ones and on the dc antarctic solo the body was also recoloured in white instead of silver discontinued modelsedit gforceedit gforce was the name given to dysons first widely available vacuum cleaner it was the first to use dual cyclone separation technology licensed to the japanese company apex inc and only available on the japanese market it was not sold under the dyson name dyson used the money he earned from gforce to start up the dyson company dcedit the first vacuum cleaner sold under the dyson name was the da launched in  it was a domestic upright model that used the patented dual cyclone technology and was made in chippenham england after a short period it was renamed the dc and production later moved to malmesbury at the companys new factoryresearch centre the dc had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of brush control where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors it stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used this was the only dyson upright not to use washable premotor filters these had to be purchased and replaced every  months it also had a choice of post motor filtration – standard or hepa high efficiency particle arrest according to the model purchased it competed with models like the hoover turbopower and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners the suction power of the dc is  airwatts dyson no longer supports this model nor produces parts for it dcedit the dc launched in  was the first cylinder canister model sold by dyson its shape allowed it to sit on stairs like the dc it used dual cyclone technology it was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the dc the dc is no longer supported by dyson the dc was available in several special editions the de stijl was colored purple red and yellow in homage to the dutch art movement from which it takes its name it was produced in a limited edition of  units the dc clear was produced in clear blue and green plastic allowing the user to see its internal components through the casing the antarctica solo model coloured white and pale blue helped raise funds for the breakthrough cancer charity whilst commemorating sir ranulph fienness solo trek across antarctica each of the limited edition run of  machines bore the image of ranulph fienness autograph the recyclone was the first vacuum cleaner to be made of recycled plastic originally intended as a testrun for a rangewide recyclone scheme the concept never went beyond a very small production run of dcs they were coloured green with organic pigment dcedit the dc dysons second upright vacuum cleaner released in  was a lightweight  kg low profile upright cleaner it resembled a twincylinder version of the dc contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of hepa filters the dc had a smaller more compact w motor and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around  airwatts its heavyduty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original cyclone cleaners were discontinued it was the first upright model to feature brush control via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll and was able to be stored hung on a wall it was also the first dyson to have the reversible hose like on the dc and dc ball dcedit the dc released around  had improved filters fitted as standard the pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushbar introduced on the dc dcedit the dc launched in  was the second cylinder model it was designed as a replacement for the dc the motorhead version was the first dyson to offer a powernozzle a floor nozzle with a motorpowered brushroll for improved performance on carpets dcedit dysons first robotic vacuum cleaner equipped with the dyson digital motor had not proceeded beyond the hometrial stage by  as cost and weight needed reducing it had the ability to learn the room and to distinguish between solid objects such as walls and furniture and human beings pets etc by utilising sensors and speciallywritten navigation software dyson dc got introduced in  dcedit dc origin dyson vacuum cleaner the dc released in  was the first implementation of root cyclone technology into a cleaner in features it was similar to the dc but included a bottom drop bin controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing which made for easier emptying and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle so making it easier to use than that on the dc many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars the dc had a new w motor that provided  airwatts making it about the most powerful model that dyson made and also the noisiest in use with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly it weighed  kg in the us the dyson dc was sold only at target the dc had a long production run from  until  and came in many different colour combinations dcedit the dc was a new cylinder revision released around  incorporating the dyson root cyclone technology found on the dc the dc was the replacement for the dc it was the first of the dyson cylinder models to feature the new animal derivative first seen on the dc which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal on carpets and furnishings – they also came equipped with hepa post motor filters none of the dc models had electric motorised floorheads like the dc the dc was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power handled by the new root  cyclone system the dc was equipped with this higher power output was able to drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the dc motorhead had lower models in the dc range did not come with the turbine floorhead having only the standard floorheads which were better suited to hard flooring than carpets unlike the dc the dc did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner as with the dc tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose the dc had a long production run it was upgraded to the dc telescope wrap after the launch of the dc to enable it to be stored more efficiently and was eventually superseded by the dc dctedit next product after the dc with telescope wrap wand handle is telescopic and the hose wraps around the machine launched in  dc dc dc omittededit there are no dyson models dc as the numbers are associated with the dc and dc aircraft produced by mcdonnell douglas dc omitted due to superstition surrounding the number  dcedit the dc was the first dyson cylinder cleaner with telescope wrap launched around  it had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away it was only available in two variants one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoiseaqua model the dc was quickly superseded by the dct telescope wrap and not produced for very long dcedit small cylinder machine released in japanlaunched near  dcplusedit small cylinders in japan topoftherange models are fitted with the dyson digital motor which rotates at  rpm dcedit the dc was released in  it is a revision of the dc upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and telescope reach it uses dysons root  cyclone technology which maintains constant suction aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin the dc looks very similar to the dc it also has the same motor as fitted to the dc and the same floorhead with the exception that the dc has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design the dc was slightly quieter in operation than the dc was but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same  watt motor like the dc the dc comes in many variants the standard dc the origin non clutched the all floors clutched the allergy clutched the animal clutched  mini turbine tool and other special editions and colourways as of january update listed as end of line on dyson web site dcedit the dc known as the ball was released in  in three variants the dc all floors allergy and animal it was the first of the many ball vacuums and is based on the dc it has a ball instead of wheels which in conjunction with a universal joint on the cleaner head makes it possible to steer the machine by twisting the handle to the right or left the inspiration of the ball system originated from the ballbarrow james dysons first invention the dc is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models and is the first dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll controlled by a switch next to the main power switch the main suction motor is housed inside the ball due to its high launch price its weight  kilograms  lb and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick not that many dcs were sold with the cheaper dc remaining much more popular the lightweight dc was launched late the following year addressing the dcs biggest criticism its heavy weight dc – dyson handheldedit dc handheld cyclonic vacuum cleaner the dc is dysons first handheld vacuum cleaner based on the same technology as used in the dc and dc root cyclone upright vacuum cleaners the dc has  airwatts of constant suction the dc shares the same styling as the other recent upright and cylinder vacuum cleaners in the dyson range and weighs  kg  lb also available in an issey miyake limited edition in which the manifold on the cyclone assembly is pink instead of the standard yellow and an animal version with a motorised brushbar for picking up pet hair and gold cyclone manifold newest to the range is the dc car and boat which is designed for car and boat cleaning supplied with a car  v charger and has a blue cyclone manifold launched in  dcedit the dyson dc is an upright cleaner launched in october  in the us although visually similar to the dc it contains new technologies the first upgrade is the use of dysons level  root cyclone this system incorporates  cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream in this system the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system beyond that the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream the level  root cyclone improves upon the original root cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow a problem with the earlier system the second change with the dc upright is the brushroll design while the brushrolls used on the dc dc and dc were designed with european carpets in mind the dcs brush roll was designed for north america with a cylindrical shape a large diameter and short stiff bristles a separate motor drives the brushroll unlike the dc and dc which use power from the main motor via clutches this made the dc the most effective of dyson cleaners on carpeting the third change is a new colour scheme for the dc and also the dyson dc root  handheld the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and titanium as the main colour for the entire machine the level  root cyclone system on the dc was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cyclones backwards clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction almost all of the original dcs had this problem the redesigned cyclone pack fitted to later dcs resolved this issue older dcs were not recalled but dyson gave out and sold many of the redesigned cyclone packscitation needed dcedit the  kilograms  lb dyson dc slim launched in september  and produced until summer  is a slimmer and lighterweight successor of the dc ball upright the dcs root cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machines slimmer profile the dc uses  cyclones the dc  the ball design has been simplified for the dc rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor the dc rides on a thin cigarshaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths dcedit cylinder model without the telescopic wrap system it was the replacement of the dc and to all intents and purposes is virtually the same in appearance and design as the dc dc tedit same as dc but improved so that the brushbar can pick up on carpets and on hard floors this model also used a plastic telescopic rod instead of the metal one found on the original dc still a current model as of november  dcedit stowaway as dc but with telescope wrap dyson have updated the dct part of the dc series to form the dc called the dyson stowaway in the uk the colour scheme is new and the cleaner is available in standard allergy and animal dcedit entering into the american market in  this model is known as the stowaway in the united states but as the motorhead in the united kingdom and other countries it is the second cylinder vacuum from dyson to have a motorised brushbar on the head of the nozzle it is an advance on the dc telescopic wrap system discontinued in some countries including the united kingdom dcedit known as dyson baby or dyson compact or dyson allergy and twothirds the size of the dc using the dyson digital motor and core separation which adds a third cyclone layer to filter out smaller particles has turbine head and motor head versions dcedit dc is similar in design to the dc but uses the new core separation that is also in the dc there is also a turbinehead animal version in canada dc tedit a dc with different accessories and tools dcedit a small version of the dc also uses ball technology with separate brushroll motor it weighs  kilogrammes  pounds and has  airwatts of suction power it is small and compact and the handle compacts further for easy storage it appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner like the dc this model has proved to be a big seller due to its extremely compact size but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors some of which have failed prematurely was superseded by the dc in november  dcedit the dc is a full size ball upright the replacement for the dc and dc a nolossofsuction vacuum features a lifetime washable high efficiency particulate air hepa filter the dc and the other upright vacuums from dyson are the only vacuum on the market that has been certified asthma and allergy friendly by the asthma and allergy foundation of america it is available as all floors yellow animal purple overdrive blue blitz it red exclusive silver and blueprint white and blue this vacuum is very similar to the dc but on a smaller size addressing issues brought up with the dc proved to be a very popular ball cleaner more so than the dc and the dc which was not a true ball model superseded in mid by the dc and dc animal dcedit ultra compact cylinder model the dc known as the dyson city is the worlds smallest vacuum with constant suction even smaller than the dc the machine is so small that it will fit onto a piece of a paper with a very small dust container of  litres and cord length of  metres it was designed for small flats with primarily hard floors it weighs just  kg and has an impressive  airwatts suction power dcedit the dc is an update on the dc the dc is a full size upright which has wheels rather than a ball an autoadjusting cleaner head and rootcyclone technology it also features an extending wand and hose and has a large debris channel to pick up large dirt particles dcedit this was another upright model produced for the us market it was the replacement for the dc has a powered cam to adjust the height of the brushbar dyson airmuscle controlled from a set of buttons by the main power switch above the cyclone assembly a pneumatic actuator to keep the cleaning head on the floor and a hightorque clutch to give extra power to the brushbar dcedit in australia the dc is a cylinder model an improved version of dc very similar to dct the main differences being colour and tooling and nonhepa machine a hepa filter is now included in  multifloor white models in canada the dc is actually an upright model similar to the dc this appears to be the first instance of a particular model number being used on an upright or a cylinder depending on country of destination supplied to continental europe and australia cylinder type and canada upright type not available in the uk according to this dyson review listing on the australian website the dyson dc multi floor is no longer available dcedit powerful handheld with a brushless switched reluctance motor can provide  minutes of high and constant suction it is smaller lighter and more powerful than the dc which uses a conventional motor the dc has a yellow cyclone manifold dcedit the most powerful handheld with the same motor technology as the dc but with a larger battery and dual power for more runtime  minutes of high constant suction at the same level as the dc or  minutes with  higher suction available as dc with a blue uk and aus yellow us or red eu cyclone manifold or the dc animal which has a purple cyclone manifold dcedit dyson dc basically the same as dct in the uk with a revised color scheme and additional tooling models current as of december edit this section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information december  dcedit revised version of the dcdc replacement for the dc upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology available as multi floor yellow stubborn white animal purple i red the dc has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the dc so attachments from older dysons such as the dc do not fit the dc this model more closely resembles the old dc than the dc did using exactly the same style of floorhead as the dc dc and dc the plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more without the support of the metal wandcitation needed the fact that older models tools were not interchangeable was also criticised with many buyers trading up from the dc or dc to the dc and finding that their old tools would not fitcitation needed the dc uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the dc dc and dc this unit has been discontinued as of july  no replacement model has been announced in mainland europe

is best known as the inventor of the dual cyclone bagless vacuum cleaner which works on the principle of cyclonic separation according to the sunday times rich list  his net worth is £ billion he served as the provost of the royal college of art from august  to july  contents  early life and education  early inventions  vacuum cleaners  other inventions  manufacturing  european single currency  james dyson foundation  honours and awards  personal life  references  external links early life and educationedit james dyson was born in cromer norfolk one of three children he was educated at greshams school an independent boarding school in holt norfolk from  to  when his father died of cancer he excelled at long distance running i was quite good at it not because i was physically good but because i had more determination i learnt determination from it he spent one year – at the byam shaw school of art and then studied furniture and interior design at the royal college of art – before moving into engineering early inventionsedit dyson helped design the sea truck in  while studying at the royal college of art his first original invention the ballbarrow was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel this was featured on the bbcs tomorrows world television programme dyson stuck with the idea of a ball which his brother had thought of inventing the trolleyball a trolley that launched boats he then designed the wheelboat which could travel at speeds of  kilometres per hour  mph on both land and water vacuum cleanersedit dc bagless dyson vacuum cleaner in the late s dyson had the idea of using cyclonic separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt he became frustrated with his hoover juniors diminishing performance the dust bag kept becoming clogged with loads of dust thus reducing suction the cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology qv history of dyson ltd partly supported by his wifes salary as an art teacher and after five years and many prototypes dyson launched the gforce cleaner in  however no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the uk as it would disturb the valuable market for replacement dust bags so dyson launched it in japan through catalogue sales manufactured in bright pink the gforce sold for the equivalent of £ it won the  international design fair prize in japan he obtained his first us patent on the idea in  us patent  after failing to sell his invention to the major manufacturers dyson set up his own manufacturing company dyson ltd in june  he opened his research centre and factory in malmesbury wiltshire dysons breakthrough in the uk market came more than ten years after the initial idea through a tv advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that unlike most of its rivals the dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags at that time the uk market for disposable cleaner bags was £ million the slogan say goodbye to the bag proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers ironically the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag – users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience the dyson dual cyclone became the fastestselling vacuum cleaner ever made in the uk and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea becoming one of the most popular brands in the uk in early  it was reported that dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the united states by value though not by number of units sold dyson licensed the technology in north america from  to  to fantom technologies after which dyson entered the market directly following his success other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners in  dyson sued hoover uk for patent infringement the high court ruled that hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its triple vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range hoover agreed to pay damages of £ million in  dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner creating the dyson ball with the aim of making it more manoeuvrable in mid dyson personally appeared in tokyo to introduce his  eye robotic vacuum cleaner dysons initial entry into this market segment features ° scanning and mapping for navigation cyclonic dust separation a customdesigned digital motor for high suction tank treads for traction a fullwidth beater bar and user interface via a free ios or android app other inventionsedit in  dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the contrarotator which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions the range was decorated in the usual bright dyson colours rather than the traditional white grey or black of most other machines the item was not a commercial success and is no longer available in  dyson created a realisation of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of dutch artist m c escher engineer derek phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp the creation titled wrong garden was displayed at the chelsea flower show in  the illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down this makes it appear that the water is flowing up when really a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer dyson airblade hand dryer in october  dyson launched the dyson airblade a fast hand dryer that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat this allows faster drying while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers another product is a fan without external blades which he calls the air multiplier in addition to a cooling fan a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available in april  dyson launched the dyson supersonic a hair dryer with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size as well as quieter operation commenting on the launch vogue magazine said as the first product to launch from dysons new uk stateoftheart hair laboratory we have high hopes for the future of our blowdries manufacturingedit in february  dyson announced that production was being shifted to malaysia leaving  workers redundant in  for economic reasons and because of difficulty acquiring land for expansion the companys headquarters and research facilities remain in malmesbury in november  dyson announced plans to invest a further £bn into the research and development of new technology including funding for a campus at the dyson uk headquarters in malmesbury which will create up to  jobs former prime minister david cameron said “dyson is a great british success story and the expansion of the malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families investment on this scale shows confidence in our longterm economic plan to back business create more jobs and secure a brighter future for britain” european single currencyedit dyson demonstrating his contrarotator washing machine in  dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of the twenty ftse  companies who signed a statement published in the financial times in  calling on the government for early british membership of the eurozone he claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the british manufacturing base and said it does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longerterm future of britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save an editorial published by the times responded mr dyson a manufacturing version of sir richard branson likes complaining yesterday he was complaining that britains failure to join the euro and the resultant strong pound will force him to move abroad last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in wiltshire but never mind so where will he go to portugal italy or to an eu candidate such as poland no mr dyson threatens to go to the far east like so many entrepreneurs he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates but also low inflation low wages a flexible labour market and low regulation he will not find them in the eurozone lord tebbit a former secretary of state for trade and industry also questioned dysons motives and said what still puzzles me is why such a euroenthusiast as mr dyson does not intend to establish his new factory in europe if he cant have it in britain in  dyson said he would now be voting to leave the european union to avoid being dominated and bullied by the germans in november  dyson lost his case against eu energy labelling laws in the european court of justice dyson was one of the most prominent uk business leaders to publicly support brexit before the referendum in june  since the eu referendum dyson has stated that britain should leave the eu single market and that this would liberate the uk economy james dyson foundationedit dyson in  at sydney australia dyson set up the foundation in  to support design and engineering education – it now operates in uk us and japan the foundations aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes the foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities it achieves this by funding different resources such as the engineering box a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid the foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge they are suitable for key stage  and above the engineering box enables students to take apart and examine a dyson dc telescope vacuum cleaner in addition a school is allowed to retain a james dyson foundation teacher pack and a copy of genius of britain a channel  tv series featuring dyson and design engineering posters other resources are also available in may  the foundation

various technologies in their products such as the dual cyclone used in vacuum cleaners and their airblade hand dryers digital motoredit the dyson digital motor is a dc electric motor operates on the switched reluctance principle used in several pieces of equipment according to dyson it is smaller lighter cleaner and more powerefficient due in part to tight tolerances than conventional electric motors these brushless motors rotate at up to  rpm the motor is a twopole brushless motor with a digital controller dyson says efficiency is  which is less than the  efficiency that is achieved in some brushless designs in order to deal with the high speed the impeller is made of carbonfibre reinforced polymer the shaft is steel the first version was named x and used in the airblade hand dryer the later ddm dyson digital motor v is used for dyson handheld vacuum cleaners airblade hand dryeredit main article dyson airblade dyson airblade view from top the dyson airblade is a hand dryer for commercial customers typically made available in public handwashing facilities the airblade uses dysons digital motor to produce a stream of air that flows at up to  mph  kmh and is claimed to dry the hands in  to  seconds the airblade uses a hepa filter to remove bacteria and mould from the air the dyson airblade is the worlds first hygienic commercial hand dryer according to nsf international it is accredited by the british skin foundation and the royal institute of public health as well the dyson airblade is haccp approved the first dyson airblade was launched in  bladeless fansedit air multiplieredit display of a range of dyson air multipliers the dyson air multiplier was announced on  october  as an electric fan intended to provide smoother airflow and having no exposed rotating blades operating in a safer manner than conventional bladed fans like other bladeless fans the apparatus itself has no visible external blades as the fan blades are concealed within the body of the product the fan works by drawing  litres of air per second in through an inlet in the base pillar and forcing it through an outlet in the upper ring the jet of air travels over the airfoil shape of the ring creating local low pressure thereby pulling air from behind it as it decelerates in a process known as inducement a property of bernoullis principle once the air exits the ring it entrains the air in front and alongside producing an airflow of  lsecond using this process a small brushless impeller in the fans base can power a much larger air outlet without exposing any blades dyson stated that the initially generated air flow is multiplied between  and  times for the models am am and am projecting a smooth stream of uninterrupted air in march  the secondgeneration models of the air multiplier were acoustically reengineered so that the bladeless fans were quieter than their predecessors by improved airflow and a helmholtz resonator to cancel a  khz whine since the original release dyson has produced combination electrical heater and cooling fans some with hepa filters based on its air multiplier design in addition some newer designs have the ability to shift between a wider and shallower or a narrower but fartherreaching stream of air under user control most of the dyson fans and heaters are controlled by small infrared remote controls which can be adhered magnetically to the appliance when not in use a more limited set of control switches is available on the body of the appliance the design for a bladeless fan was patented by toshiba in  but was never manufactured the initial patent claim by dyson was rejected by the intellectual property office ruling that it cannot be considered novel or cannot be considered to involve an inventive step compared to the japanese version the air multiplier fan received the good design award in  fan heateredit in september  dyson announced the dyson hot fan heater am using air multiplier technology like most fan heaters it has a thermostat to control the temperature and can also be used as a fan without heat all am models made prior to  april  were subject to a nocharge product recall for repairs because of a fire risk ultrasonic humidifieredit in march  dyson released their new air multiplier humidifier it uses ultraviolet cleanse technology to clean water by running it through ultraviolet light twice before it is released a piezoelectric transducer in the base vibrates up to  million times a second to break the water down into small particles which are drawn up and added to the air with air multiplier technology air purifieredit in january  dyson released the dyson pure cool air purifier it uses the same air multiplier technology to blow air as well as a  micron hepa filter to trap air particles along with the filter to trap slow particles the unit uses lowforce velocity to trap fine particles within the filter as well contrarotator washing machineedit the discontinued dyson cr contrarotator is a washing machine with two counterrotating drums the first of its type each drum had  spin perforations to help evacuate water the machine was first available in november  dysons next washing machine in  was the cr with flowcheck and allergy models the company later stopped making washing machines the same year as they were unprofitable for the company as of november  dyson no longer supports or services the contrarotator washing machines which it has officially declared obsolete hair dryeredit on  april  dyson introduced the supersonic handheld hair dryer the digital motor v is housed in the handle lightingedit in  dyson introduced the csys range of led lamps the lamps incorporate heat pipe technology designed to extend the life of the product vacuum cleanersedit root cyclone technologyedit the dyson root cyclone technology is used in all dyson vacuum cleaners from dc the dc dc and dc use the improved root cyclone  core separator also called radix cyclone intermediary cyclone or level  root cyclone technology model versionsedit all versions are identified by a name such as dc some have submodels identified by a suffix indicating specific facilities implemented sometimes by additional tools supplied suffixes with the same meaning vary from model to model all floors multi floor woodwool suitable for both hard surfaces and carpets allergy suitable for filtering out microscopic allergens animal will pick up animal hairs better than a generalpurpose model and filter out fine particles these machines all come with a mini turbine tool to help remove pet hair human hair and cotton fibres from upholstery cars and confined areas motorhead cylinder model with motorised brush head full gear same features as animal with more attachments special edition modelsedit other suffixes sometimes used indicate exclusivity to certain stores eg comet exclusive and overdrive comet or blitz it currys some are limited editions drawing limited editionsedit these machines feature a different range of tools to the usual multifloor and animal versions and also appear in different colours the drawing later became exclusive to john lewis de stijl limited editionsedit some of the early dyson models dc dc dc were available in a special limited edition de stijl colour scheme in homage to the dutch design movement of the same name all these are coloured a combination of purple red and yellow dyson antarctic solo limited editionsedit in   recolored dc and dc models were produced as part of a fundraising effort for ranulph fienness solo expedition to the antarctic for these models the yellow parts found on the mainstream models were replaced with light blue ones and on the dc antarctic solo the body was also recoloured in white instead of silver discontinued modelsedit gforceedit gforce was the name given to dysons first widely available vacuum cleaner it was the first to use dual cyclone separation technology licensed to the japanese company apex inc and only available on the japanese market it was not sold under the dyson name dyson used the money he earned from gforce to start up the dyson company dcedit the first vacuum cleaner sold under the dyson name was the da launched in  it was a domestic upright model that used the patented dual cyclone technology and was made in chippenham england after a short period it was renamed the dc and production later moved to malmesbury at the companys new factoryresearch centre the dc had a single motor which provided the suction and also drove the brushroll directly via a single rubber toothless belt with no form of brush control where the user can turn off the brushroll for use on hard floors so was mainly designed to use on carpeted floors it stored its hose on the back of the housing as part of the handle wand and removing the handle wand enabled this stretch hose to be used this was the only dyson upright not to use washable premotor filters these had to be purchased and replaced every  months it also had a choice of post motor filtration – standard or hepa high efficiency particle arrest according to the model purchased it competed with models like the hoover turbopower and was priced very high in comparison to other bagged cleaners the suction power of the dc is  airwatts dyson no longer supports this model nor produces parts for it dcedit the dc launched in  was the first cylinder canister model sold by dyson its shape allowed it to sit on stairs like the dc it used dual cyclone technology it was not that popular during its production run and sold fewer than the dc the dc is no longer supported by dyson the dc was available in several special editions the de stijl was colored purple red and yellow in homage to the dutch art movement from which it takes its name it was produced in a limited edition of  units the dc clear was produced in clear blue and green plastic allowing the user to see its internal components through the casing the antarctica solo model coloured white and pale blue helped raise funds for the breakthrough cancer charity whilst commemorating sir ranulph fienness solo trek across antarctica each of the limited edition run of  machines bore the image of ranulph fienness autograph the recyclone was the first vacuum cleaner to be made of recycled plastic originally intended as a testrun for a rangewide recyclone scheme the concept never went beyond a very small production run of dcs they were coloured green with organic pigment dcedit the dc dysons second upright vacuum cleaner released in  was a lightweight  kg low profile upright cleaner it resembled a twincylinder version of the dc contained one normal cylinder and a second which contained a pair of hepa filters the dc had a smaller more compact w motor and while its suction power was lower than any of the currently available uprights at around  airwatts its heavyduty filtration system allowed it to survive for many years after the rest of the original cyclone cleaners were discontinued it was the first upright model to feature brush control via a clutch between the motor and the brushroll and was able to be stored hung on a wall it was also the first dyson to have the reversible hose like on the dc and dc ball dcedit the dc released around  had improved filters fitted as standard the pre motor filter was washable and was relocated to the top of the cyclone assembly and the tools stored on the top of the filter housing most models also featured the new clutch controlled brushbar introduced on the dc dcedit the dc launched in  was the second cylinder model it was designed as a replacement for the dc the motorhead version was the first dyson to offer a powernozzle a floor nozzle with a motorpowered brushroll for improved performance on carpets dcedit dysons first robotic vacuum cleaner equipped with the dyson digital motor had not proceeded beyond the hometrial stage by  as cost and weight needed reducing it had the ability to learn the room and to distinguish between solid objects such as walls and furniture and human beings pets etc by utilising sensors and speciallywritten navigation software dyson dc got introduced in  dcedit dc origin dyson vacuum cleaner the dc released in  was the first implementation of root cyclone technology into a cleaner in features it was similar to the dc but included a bottom drop bin controlled by a trigger in the top of the cyclone housing which made for easier emptying and the handle wand was also able to be reversed and fitted to the hose cuff at the handle so making it easier to use than that on the dc many models were fitted with clutch controlled brushbars the dc had a new w motor that provided  airwatts making it about the most powerful model that dyson made and also the noisiest in use with much of the operating noise coming from the upwards mounted cyclone assembly it weighed  kg in the us the dyson dc was sold only at target the dc had a long production run from  until  and came in many different colour combinations dcedit the dc was a new cylinder revision released around  incorporating the dyson root cyclone technology found on the dc the dc was the replacement for the dc it was the first of the dyson cylinder models to feature the new animal derivative first seen on the dc which essentially meant that the cleaner was capable of dealing effectively with pet hair and dander animal models came with an air driven turbine floorhead and mini turbo brush for effective pet hair removal on carpets and furnishings – they also came equipped with hepa post motor filters none of the dc models had electric motorised floorheads like the dc the dc was fitted with an uprated motor giving it more suction power handled by the new root  cyclone system the dc was equipped with this higher power output was able to drive the main turbo floorhead without the need for an electric motor and the expensive wiring that the dc motorhead had lower models in the dc range did not come with the turbine floorhead having only the standard floorheads which were better suited to hard flooring than carpets unlike the dc the dc did not have storage for its small tools in the body of the cleaner as with the dc tools were stored on a small caddy attached to the suction hose the dc had a long production run it was upgraded to the dc telescope wrap after the launch of the dc to enable it to be stored more efficiently and was eventually superseded by the dc dctedit next product after the dc with telescope wrap wand handle is telescopic and the hose wraps around the machine launched in  dc dc dc omittededit there are no dyson models dc as the numbers are associated with the dc and dc aircraft produced by mcdonnell douglas dc omitted due to superstition surrounding the number  dcedit the dc was the first dyson cylinder cleaner with telescope wrap launched around  it had two separate dust bins and cyclone assemblies to make the machine smaller when it was packed away it was only available in two variants one coloured yellow and the other was a turquoiseaqua model the dc was quickly superseded by the dct telescope wrap and not produced for very long dcedit small cylinder machine released in japanlaunched near  dcplusedit small cylinders in japan topoftherange models are fitted with the dyson digital motor which rotates at  rpm dcedit the dc was released in  it is a revision of the dc upright vacuum cleaner with lower centre of gravity and telescope reach it uses dysons root  cyclone technology which maintains constant suction aside from the different design of the cyclone assembly and bin the dc looks very similar to the dc it also has the same motor as fitted to the dc and the same floorhead with the exception that the dc has a large debris channel fitted to the front of the brushroll housing due to the different downwards pointing cyclone design the dc was slightly quieter in operation than the dc was but still had the familiar motor noise as it used the same  watt motor like the dc the dc comes in many variants the standard dc the origin non clutched the all floors clutched the allergy clutched the animal clutched  mini turbine tool and other special editions and colourways as of january update listed as end of line on dyson web site dcedit the dc known as the ball was released in  in three variants the dc all floors allergy and animal it was the first of the many ball vacuums and is based on the dc it has a ball instead of wheels which in conjunction with a universal joint on the cleaner head makes it possible to steer the machine by twisting the handle to the right or left the inspiration of the ball system originated from the ballbarrow james dysons first invention the dc is a complex machine compared to earlier upright models and is the first dyson upright with an independent motorised brushroll controlled by a switch next to the main power switch the main suction motor is housed inside the ball due to its high launch price its weight  kilograms  lb and the fact that it may have initially been seen as a gimmick not that many dcs were sold with the cheaper dc remaining much more popular the lightweight dc was launched late the following year addressing the dcs biggest criticism its heavy weight dc – dyson handheldedit dc handheld cyclonic vacuum cleaner the dc is dysons first handheld vacuum cleaner based on the same technology as used in the dc and dc root cyclone upright vacuum cleaners the dc has  airwatts of constant suction the dc shares the same styling as the other recent upright and cylinder vacuum cleaners in the dyson range and weighs  kg  lb also available in an issey miyake limited edition in which the manifold on the cyclone assembly is pink instead of the standard yellow and an animal version with a motorised brushbar for picking up pet hair and gold cyclone manifold newest to the range is the dc car and boat which is designed for car and boat cleaning supplied with a car  v charger and has a blue cyclone manifold launched in  dcedit the dyson dc is an upright cleaner launched in october  in the us although visually similar to the dc it contains new technologies the first upgrade is the use of dysons level  root cyclone this system incorporates  cyclones to more efficiently filter sand and dust particles out of the airstream in this system the airflow travels from the low speed outer cyclone to two intermediate cyclones that filter out the bulk of dust and sand particles that are drawn into the system beyond that the airflow flows through the remaining eight high speed cyclones which filters any remaining dust particles out of the airstream the level  root cyclone improves upon the original root cyclone system with its capability to more efficiently separate sand particles from the air flow a problem with the earlier system the second change with the dc upright is the brushroll design while the brushrolls used on the dc dc and dc were designed with european carpets in mind the dcs brush roll was designed for north america with a cylindrical shape a large diameter and short stiff bristles a separate motor drives the brushroll unlike the dc and dc which use power from the main motor via clutches this made the dc the most effective of dyson cleaners on carpeting the third change is a new colour scheme for the dc and also the dyson dc root  handheld the bright colours and silver tones are toned down in favour of shiny metallic accents and titanium as the main colour for the entire machine the level  root cyclone system on the dc was quietly redesigned due to a gasket defect that allowed dirt to enter the cyclones backwards clogging them and causing the cleaner to lose suction almost all of the original dcs had this problem the redesigned cyclone pack fitted to later dcs resolved this issue older dcs were not recalled but dyson gave out and sold many of the redesigned cyclone packscitation needed dcedit the  kilograms  lb dyson dc slim launched in september  and produced until summer  is a slimmer and lighterweight successor of the dc ball upright the dcs root cyclone system has been trimmed down to better accommodate the machines slimmer profile the dc uses  cyclones the dc  the ball design has been simplified for the dc rather than riding on a large ball that encloses the primary motor the dc rides on a thin cigarshaped roller that provides more space for separate motor enclosure and airway paths dcedit cylinder model without the telescopic wrap system it was the replacement of the dc and to all intents and purposes is virtually the same in appearance and design as the dc dc tedit same as dc but improved so that the brushbar can pick up on carpets and on hard floors this model also used a plastic telescopic rod instead of the metal one found on the original dc still a current model as of november  dcedit stowaway as dc but with telescope wrap dyson have updated the dct part of the dc series to form the dc called the dyson stowaway in the uk the colour scheme is new and the cleaner is available in standard allergy and animal dcedit entering into the american market in  this model is known as the stowaway in the united states but as the motorhead in the united kingdom and other countries it is the second cylinder vacuum from dyson to have a motorised brushbar on the head of the nozzle it is an advance on the dc telescopic wrap system discontinued in some countries including the united kingdom dcedit known as dyson baby or dyson compact or dyson allergy and twothirds the size of the dc using the dyson digital motor and core separation which adds a third cyclone layer to filter out smaller particles has turbine head and motor head versions dcedit dc is similar in design to the dc but uses the new core separation that is also in the dc there is also a turbinehead animal version in canada dc tedit a dc with different accessories and tools dcedit a small version of the dc also uses ball technology with separate brushroll motor it weighs  kilogrammes  pounds and has  airwatts of suction power it is small and compact and the handle compacts further for easy storage it appeals to people who prefer a lightweight cleaner like the dc this model has proved to be a big seller due to its extremely compact size but did have quality issues with the brushroll motors some of which have failed prematurely was superseded by the dc in november  dcedit the dc is a full size ball upright the replacement for the dc and dc a nolossofsuction vacuum features a lifetime washable high efficiency particulate air hepa filter the dc and the other upright vacuums from dyson are the only vacuum on the market that has been certified asthma and allergy friendly by the asthma and allergy foundation of america it is available as all floors yellow animal purple overdrive blue blitz it red exclusive silver and blueprint white and blue this vacuum is very similar to the dc but on a smaller size addressing issues brought up with the dc proved to be a very popular ball cleaner more so than the dc and the dc which was not a true ball model superseded in mid by the dc and dc animal dcedit ultra compact cylinder model the dc known as the dyson city is the worlds smallest vacuum with constant suction even smaller than the dc the machine is so small that it will fit onto a piece of a paper with a very small dust container of  litres and cord length of  metres it was designed for small flats with primarily hard floors it weighs just  kg and has an impressive  airwatts suction power dcedit the dc is an update on the dc the dc is a full size upright which has wheels rather than a ball an autoadjusting cleaner head and rootcyclone technology it also features an extending wand and hose and has a large debris channel to pick up large dirt particles dcedit this was another upright model produced for the us market it was the replacement for the dc has a powered cam to adjust the height of the brushbar dyson airmuscle controlled from a set of buttons by the main power switch above the cyclone assembly a pneumatic actuator to keep the cleaning head on the floor and a hightorque clutch to give extra power to the brushbar dcedit in australia the dc is a cylinder model an improved version of dc very similar to dct the main differences being colour and tooling and nonhepa machine a hepa filter is now included in  multifloor white models in canada the dc is actually an upright model similar to the dc this appears to be the first instance of a particular model number being used on an upright or a cylinder depending on country of destination supplied to continental europe and australia cylinder type and canada upright type not available in the uk according to this dyson review listing on the australian website the dyson dc multi floor is no longer available dcedit powerful handheld with a brushless switched reluctance motor can provide  minutes of high and constant suction it is smaller lighter and more powerful than the dc which uses a conventional motor the dc has a yellow cyclone manifold dcedit the most powerful handheld with the same motor technology as the dc but with a larger battery and dual power for more runtime  minutes of high constant suction at the same level as the dc or  minutes with  higher suction available as dc with a blue uk and aus yellow us or red eu cyclone manifold or the dc animal which has a purple cyclone manifold dcedit dyson dc basically the same as dct in the uk with a revised color scheme and additional tooling models current as of december edit this section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information december  dcedit revised version of the dcdc replacement for the dc upright wheeled cleaner that does not use ball technology available as multi floor yellow stubborn white animal purple i red the dc has a plastic telescopic pole with smaller diameter than the metal telescopic pole of the dc so attachments from older dysons such as the dc do not fit the dc this model more closely resembles the old dc than the dc did using exactly the same style of floorhead as the dc dc and dc the plastic wand pole has been criticised as a lowering of quality from the older metal type and also causes the main spine of the cleaner to flex more without the support of the metal wandcitation needed the fact that older models tools were not interchangeable was also criticised with many buyers trading up from the dc or dc to the dc and finding that their old tools would not fitcitation needed the dc uses a single motor for the suction and to drive the brushroll via a mechanical clutch as on the dc dc and dc this unit has been discontinued as of july  no replacement model has been announced in mainland europe the dcc is a cylinder machine known as the allergy

inventor of the dual cyclone bagless vacuum cleaner which works on the principle of cyclonic separation according to the sunday times rich list  his net worth is £ billion he served as the provost of the royal college of art from august  to july  contents  early life and education  early inventions  vacuum cleaners  other inventions  manufacturing  european single currency  james dyson foundation  honours and awards  personal life  references  external links early life and educationedit james dyson was born in cromer norfolk one of three children he was educated at greshams school an independent boarding school in holt norfolk from  to  when his father died of cancer he excelled at long distance running i was quite good at it not because i was physically good but because i had more determination i learnt determination from it he spent one year – at the byam shaw school of art and then studied furniture and interior design at the royal college of art – before moving into engineering early inventionsedit dyson helped design the sea truck in  while studying at the royal college of art his first original invention the ballbarrow was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel this was featured on the bbcs tomorrows world television programme dyson stuck with the idea of a ball which his brother had thought of inventing the trolleyball a trolley that launched boats he then designed the wheelboat which could travel at speeds of  kilometres per hour  mph on both land and water vacuum cleanersedit dc bagless dyson vacuum cleaner in the late s dyson had the idea of using cyclonic separation to create a vacuum cleaner that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt he became frustrated with his hoover juniors diminishing performance the dust bag kept becoming clogged with loads of dust thus reducing suction the cyclone idea came from a sawmill that used cyclone technology qv history of dyson ltd partly supported by his wifes salary as an art teacher and after five years and many prototypes dyson launched the gforce cleaner in  however no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the uk as it would disturb the valuable market for replacement dust bags so dyson launched it in japan through catalogue sales manufactured in bright pink the gforce sold for the equivalent of £ it won the  international design fair prize in japan he obtained his first us patent on the idea in  us patent  after failing to sell his invention to the major manufacturers dyson set up his own manufacturing company dyson ltd in june  he opened his research centre and factory in malmesbury wiltshire dysons breakthrough in the uk market came more than ten years after the initial idea through a tv advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that unlike most of its rivals the dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags at that time the uk market for disposable cleaner bags was £ million the slogan say goodbye to the bag proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers ironically the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag – users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience the dyson dual cyclone became the fastestselling vacuum cleaner ever made in the uk and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea becoming one of the most popular brands in the uk in early  it was reported that dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the united states by value though not by number of units sold dyson licensed the technology in north america from  to  to fantom technologies after which dyson entered the market directly following his success other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners in  dyson sued hoover uk for patent infringement the high court ruled that hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its triple vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range hoover agreed to pay damages of £ million in  dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner creating the dyson ball with the aim of making it more manoeuvrable in mid dyson personally appeared in tokyo to introduce his  eye robotic vacuum cleaner dysons initial entry into this market segment features ° scanning and mapping for navigation cyclonic dust separation a customdesigned digital motor for high suction tank treads for traction a fullwidth beater bar and user interface via a free ios or android app other inventionsedit in  dyson expanded his appliance range to include a washing machine called the contrarotator which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions the range was decorated in the usual bright dyson colours rather than the traditional white grey or black of most other machines the item was not a commercial success and is no longer available in  dyson created a realisation of the optical illusions depicted in the lithographs of dutch artist m c escher engineer derek phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp the creation titled wrong garden was displayed at the chelsea flower show in  the illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down this makes it appear that the water is flowing up when really a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer dyson airblade hand dryer in october  dyson launched the dyson airblade a fast hand dryer that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a squeegee to remove water rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat this allows faster drying while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers another product is a fan without external blades which he calls the air multiplier in addition to a cooling fan a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available in april  dyson launched the dyson supersonic a hair dryer with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size as well as quieter operation commenting on the launch vogue magazine said as the first product to launch from dysons new uk stateoftheart hair laboratory we have high hopes for the future of our blowdries manufacturingedit in february  dyson announced that production was being shifted to malaysia leaving  workers redundant in  for economic reasons and because of difficulty acquiring land for expansion the companys headquarters and research facilities remain in malmesbury in november  dyson announced plans to invest a further £bn into the research and development of new technology including funding for a campus at the dyson uk headquarters in malmesbury which will create up to  jobs former prime minister david cameron said “dyson is a great british success story and the expansion of the malmesbury campus will create thousands of new jobs providing a real boost to the local economy and financial security for more hardworking families investment on this scale shows confidence in our longterm economic plan to back business create more jobs and secure a brighter future for britain” european single currencyedit dyson demonstrating his contrarotator washing machine in  dyson was one of the chairmen and chief executives of the twenty ftse  companies who signed a statement published in the financial times in  calling on the government for early british membership of the eurozone he claimed that failure to join the euro would lead to the destruction of the british manufacturing base and said it does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longerterm future of britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save an editorial published by the times responded mr dyson a manufacturing version of sir richard branson likes complaining yesterday he was complaining that britains failure to join the euro and the resultant strong pound will force him to move abroad last week he blamed the price of land and planning delays in wiltshire but never mind so where will he go to portugal italy or to an eu candidate such as poland no mr dyson threatens to go to the far east like so many entrepreneurs he wants a cheap currency and low interest rates but also low inflation low wages a flexible labour market and low regulation he will not find them in the eurozone lord tebbit a former secretary of state for trade and industry also questioned dysons motives and said what still puzzles me is why such a euroenthusiast as mr dyson does not intend to establish his new factory in europe if he cant have it in britain in  dyson said he would now be voting to leave the european union to avoid being dominated and bullied by the germans in november  dyson lost his case against eu energy labelling laws in the european court of justice dyson was one of the most prominent uk business leaders to publicly support brexit before the referendum in june  since the eu referendum dyson has stated that britain should leave the eu single market and that this would liberate the uk economy james dyson foundationedit dyson in  at sydney australia dyson set up the foundation in  to support design and engineering education – it now operates in uk us and japan the foundations aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes the foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities it achieves this by funding different resources such as the engineering box a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid the foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge they are suitable for key stage  and above the engineering box enables students to take apart and examine a dyson dc telescope vacuum cleaner in addition a school is allowed to retain a james dyson foundation teacher pack and a copy of genius of britain a channel  tv series featuring dyson and design engineering posters other resources are also available in may  the foundation announced an £m donation to create a technology hub at the university of cambridge a new fourstorey building will house  postgraduate engineers and support worldleading research the donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students in march  the james dyson foundation pledged a £m donation to imperial college london to allow the purchase of an iconic post office building located on exhibition road from the science museum imperial college will open the dyson school of design engineering in this building and teach a new fouryear masters course in design engineering developing a new cohort of creative and theoretical engineers the foundation also supports the work of young designers through the james dyson award this is an international design award that celebrates encourages and inspires the next generation of design engineers it is run in twenty countries and is open to recent graduates in product design industrial design and engineering honours and awardsedit in  dyson was awarded
