we will retain the proceeds from any funds raised and the proceeds will not be returned to the investor in the event that we only raise a minimum amount under this offering we will immediately utilize the proceeds as a result if you are an initial investor and we fail to raise additional proceeds your investment will be rendered worthless if we raise  in this offering we expect that we will

to continue in operations through may  for example if we only sell   of the offering or   of the offering in securities we will utilize the proceeds in our operations but we will not be able to implement our business plan to any meaningful extent rendering your investment worthless if the maximum number of shares of common stock is sold we estimate that we will receive proceeds of  from our sale of the  shares of common stock offered by us this estimate is based on an initial public offering price of  per share subscription funds will not be placed into escrow trust or any other similar arrangement there are no investor protections for the return of subscription funds once accepted once we receive the purchase price for the shares we will be able to use the funds we expect to use the net proceeds of the offering for working capital purposes including payment of consultants for software development and website design and development our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors including the successful commercialization of our website competing technological and market developments and the development of strategic alliances for the development and marketing of our website we intend to try to obtain funds through equity or debt financing strategic alliances with corporate partners and others or through other sources on september   four shareholders loaned our company  in consideration of a promissory note with a ten year term due and payable in september  with interest that accrues at  per annum in addition during

or its assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or the funds available prove to be insufficient to fund operations at the planned level due to further unanticipated expenses delays problems or otherwise we could be required to obtain additional funds earlier than expected we do not have any committed sources of additional financing and there can be no assurance that additional funding if necessary will be available on acceptable terms if at all if adequate funds are not available we may be required to further delay scaleback or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies product candidates products or potential markets if adequate funds are not available our business financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected until required for operations our policy is to invest our cash reserves in bank deposits we expect that its operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future and will depend on a number of factors most of which are outside our control in recent years a substantial number of competing group buying sites have emerged around the world our major domestic competitors will include woot groupon google microsoft eversave buy with me and living social these competitors offer substantially the same or similar product offerings that we intend to although none of our comptetitors employ anything similar to the shareholderblogger component of our company’s structure and business model we will also compete with businesses that focus on particular merchant categories or markets we will also compete with traditional offline discount services as well as newspapers magazines and other traditional media companies that provide discounts on products and services we believe the principal competitive factors in our target market include the following  breadth of subscriber base and merchants featured  local presence and understanding of local business trends  ability to deliver a high volume of relevant deals to consumers  ability to produce high purchase rates for deals among subscribers  ability to generate positive return on investment for merchants and  strength and recognition of our brand although we believe we may compete favorably on the factors described above we anticipate that larger more established companies may directly compete with us many of our potential competitors have longer operating histories significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than we do these factors may allow our competitors to benefit from their existing customer or subscriber base with lower acquisition costs or to respond more quickly than we may be able to to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements these competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies which may allow them to build a larger subscriber base or to monetize that subscriber base more effectively than us our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services in addition although we do not believe that merchant payment terms are a principal competitive factor in our intended market they may become such a factor and we may be unable to compete fairly on such terms company description we are a development stage company ournett holdings inc “ournett” is in the process of developing an ecommerce marketplace that
