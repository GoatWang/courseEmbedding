everything practical implementation of tail risk hedging​​ michael connor markus aakko article introduction“just in time” hedging is nearly impossible by the time an investor decides to hedge the market may already price in the significant risk of a tail event instead hedges could be included as a permanent part of an asset allocation what we might call “just in case” hedging  an optimal strategy may involve averaging into a hedging allocation in addition using a broader set of hedge instruments may help lower the costs  we believe that tail risk hedges have a place in any portfolio that has a substantial allocation to risk assets ​ article main bodythe natural tendency of most investors is to seek hedging against market volatility when markets become bearish and to eschew any hedging expense when market sentiment seems very bullish as a result most investors tend not to hold hedges exactly when they may be most attractive – near market peaks when implied volatility is at its lows at its core “just in time” hedging is merely speculation it is akin to purchasing earthquake or flood insurance only during times when you expect a natural disaster is imminent – and similarly to natural events market conditions are very difficult to forecast for example based on the vix index – the chicago board options exchange’s volatility index which measures the implicit cost of hedging – markets were moderately concerned but not expecting a deadlock as the us congress approached the edge of a “fiscal cliff” at the end of  when it became apparent that there might in fact be a standoff the vix rose sharply higher and then collapsed on the first trading day of the new year after an agreement was reached on  jan  see figure  waiting until the last minute to hedge would have proven very costly in this case as options purchased in the last few days of  collapsed in price in ​       theoretically if the investment horizon were infinite hedging might not be necessary over long periods of time an investor may incur positive returns from many sources of risk premium even in the case of very long horizons however the contingent liquidity that tail risk hedging trh generates in a market crisis affords investors the opportunity to buy assets at distressed prices and hence may be an attractive addition to an asset allocation    in practice though few investors are able to dismiss investment risk as a “shortterm fluctuation” reporting to stakeholders usually takes place at least annually and over the short run there can be considerable volatility in addition pension funds and others who are making substantial payouts on a yearly basis will find that making these payouts funded by sales of assets at extremely depressed prices can have a severe impact on future performance for investors who have a substantial amount of risk assets in their portfolio trh can make it easier to maintain or even increase this returnseeking allocation given the expected reduction in exposure to lefttail risks is timing everythingthe cost of hedging can vary significantly over any given timeframe and “just in time” hedging is nearly impossible by the time an investor decides to hedge the market correction may have already begun and hedging may have already become expensive ideally then hedges could be included as a permanent part of an asset allocation and hence would be in place when most needed – what we might call “just in case” hedging and even in a rising market trh can add value providing a “trailing stop” to the portfolio that may give investors more comfort in maintaining their allocations to risk assets when markets rally in fact some investors may consider a countercyclical approach varying the amount of hedges purchased based on the level of implied volatility a simple way of accomplishing this is to set a fixed budget and spread purchases over time if options are expensive the fixed budget buys less hedging and if they are cheap some of the budget can even be held back for a later period as long as the desired hedge ratio is accomplished and since hedging tends to be cheapest when equity markets are at their peaks and vice versa an investor can potentially use this countercyclicality to their advantage see figures  and            when considering spreading purchases over time one practical methodology in today’s steep volatility term structure could be to implement year hedges in a laddered fashion purchasing ¼ of the targeted notional value each quarter each tranche would hedge  of the total portfolio for year from the execution date and with a tail risk hedge level that is set relative to market levels on the execution date in this way the hedger will have both time and strike price diversity in the hedge portfolio see figure    alternatively one could purchase full n​otional for a quarter and continue rolling month options one downside of this shorterdated option strategy is that it comes with little time value it may be cheaper but at the same time if a significant market event takes place shorter maturity options are unlikely to provide as much of a hedge as staggered longer maturity options do   the indirect approachtiming is not everything – what you buy and how you structure your hedges is equally important volatility is not uniformly priced in every market and from time to time investors may be able to purchase cheaper hedges using correlated hedge instruments in other markets   as an example when markets experience a sharp correction currency markets may reflect repatriation flows in that event currencies with higher yields will tend to sell off and currencies with lower yields will tend to appreciate this is often called an unwind of the carry trade for instance note how the correlation of the australian dollar aud with the sp  becomes stronger when there is a pronounced equity market selloff see figure  if the outofthemoney otm options markets price to the average correlation  instead of the tail correlation  then the price of the otm aud put may be as much as  cheap to the sp  put – a significant savings       because the choice of hedge instrument will change depending on market conditions these proxy hedges can be actively managed for example if a currency proxy hedge suddenly becomes more valuable relative to the direct hedge it may make sense to take profits on that indirect hedge and rotate to other hedges or even direct equity puts   note that the use of indirect hedges does not come without some additional risk because proxy hedges may fail to perform in line with direct hedges and therefore result in poor hedging against the specified risks they should be used in moderation and in conjunction with direct hedges the idiosyncratic risk associated with each proxy hedge can also be moderated through portfolio diversification – in other words purchasing a portfolio of different proxy hedges in order to reduce exposure to any one specific indirect hedge along with this proper management of a trh portfolio requires a robust set of tools to quantify and limit this basis risk funding the hedgesin most portfolios we find that financing a hedging program can be accomplished entirely through raising funds from existing investments and using the proceeds to purchase options however some investors may consider these outlays too large for comfort   options markets can help – investors can choose to sell some options to finance purchase of the hedges we are not advocating the use of collar strategies as these can be very costly – for example an investor hedging an equity portfolio using collars from  to  would have paid on average over  of the hedge amount in losses on the sold option as the markets rallied and the volatility curve “rolled up” see figure      therefore we believe that sold option positions should be complementary to the overall investment strategy for example for a pension fund with a longduration liability and an objective of obtaining more duration as yields rise swaptions could allow the pension plan to “precommit” to extending duration at higher yields by selling payer swaptions above current yield levels proceeds of these swaption sales could then be used to finance purchases of equity puts and indirect proxy hedges in this case the investor is taking advantage of the natural positioning in the portfolio to reduce the hedging costfigure  offers a numerical example of this approach a plan aiming to hedge  million of equity exposure could sell  million of payer swaptions  basis points above the current market yield     very careful strategy planning is required for these combined approaches and stress testing and scenario analysis in relation to collateral needs may be important   hedging strategies key takeaways for investorstiming of hedging decisions matters – purchasing hedges at their most expensive reduces the efficacy of hedging since the market already prices in significant risk of a tail event at pimco we believe that tail risk hedges have a place in any portfolio that has a substantial allocation to risk assets however timing the entry point for a hedging program is unlikely to be possible and so the optimal strategy may involve averaging into a hedging allocation beginning at a time when equity prices are high and the cost of hedging is low as appears to be the case now given current sp  and vix levels in addition using a broader set of hedge instruments may help lower the costs when combined with a disciplined approach to cost averaging and potential sale of some options to finance the overall hedging program it may be possible to mitigate a large part of the cost of the overall hedging program pimco japan ltdtoranomon

all in depth share facebook twitter google linked in email print pdf   pdf         subscribe in depth february  understanding derivative overlays in all their forms markus aakko rene martel article introduction​passively managed overlays are typically based on a simple formula while active approaches involve more complex algorithms or decisionmaking overlay examples include portable alpha ldi currency completion rebalancing and tactical asset allocation overlays  as well as tailrisk hedging and hedge fund replication potential benefits include the ability to effectively manage cash reduce costs and risk exposure simplify manager transitions and express tactical views article main bodyderivative overlays have become a mainstay of modern pension fund management many plans use overlay strategies in order to achieve a variety of asset allocation objectives ranging from passive currency hedging to implementation of tactical shifts or even complex hedge fund replication strategies the proliferation of these overlay strategies has created substantial confusion in terminology as a multitude of approaches are offered under this term complicating the matter even further there are many practical considerations that pension plans need to consider once they identify the appropriate overlay strategy for example the potential for leverage exists whenever an overlay strategy is implemented whether the program is outsourced or run inhouse when an overlay strategy is outsourced the potential for leverage usually means that the plan sponsor and overlay manager interact and communicate much more frequently than they do in other asset management relationships not to do so would invite additional risk to plan assets and funded status taxonomy of overlays overlay strategies come in a variety of forms some are managed passively with formulaic objectives that can be executed inexpensively other strategies involve complex algorithms or sometimes even active decisionmaking in trying to identify the types of overlay strategies that exist we have included most strategies currently marketed under the name “overlay” while overlay strategies have many divergent features the common element among them is that they typically involve a synthetic replication of an asset class market or factor exposure in many cases the exposure obtained may be greater than the actual funded amount of the mandate this implicit financing and leverage is typically obtained either through the use of derivative instruments or forwardsettling purchases one way overlay strategies can be broadly categorized is by the time horizon associated with changes in positioning some overlays transact frequently in order to adjust to market conditions while others are established as more of a strategic position the most common strategies are shown in figure  portable alpha overlays are used in an attempt to exceed performance of a given market exposure through investments in another often unrelated asset class for example an investment in the sp  index obtained by purchasing constituent stocks of the index will equal the performance of the sp  however if the exposure is obtained synthetically using futures or swaps the return to the investor will be equal to the return of the sp  index less a financing rate plus the return on the cash collateral portfolio as futures and swaps do not require the investor to pay for the market exposure up front but instead only that they post initial margin and marktomarket payments to the extent that the collateral portfolio outperforms the financing rate  in the current market environment the investor should achieve a return that exceeds that of the sp  index for further discussion on portable alpha strategies and risks see for example “portable alpha – theory and practice” published by wiley finance currency overlays are used to hedge currency exposures of the plan when managed passively or to take active views in the foreign exchange market when managed actively currency overlays often are complementary to both rebalancing and completion overlays because plans that invest in foreign securities usually hedge at least some part of their currency exposure back to their home currency liabilitydriven investment ldi or duration overlays are generally used to hedge the interest rate risk arising from pension plan liabilities most overlays are implemented using swaps futures or bond forwards in the plainvanilla case plans match all or part of their liability structure based on duration key rate duration curve andor convexity some of the more complicated strategies involve optionality for example using swaption collars or even active management hedge fund replication or hedge fund completion overlays are strategies that intend to replicate exposures to common factors in hedge funds hedge fund replication is based on the premise that part of hedge fund returns can be attributed to directional persistent exposures such as credit risk or to strategies eg momentumbased investing that can be systematically replicated using sophisticated statistical techniques these replication strategies are typically offered for a fraction of the cost traditional hedge funds charge replication strategies are relatively new so judging the investment merits of replacing part of the traditional hedge fund allocation in investment portfolios is still difficult to assess tailrisk hedging strategies are among the more advanced recent additions to a pension manager’s toolkit the hedges are investments in options that are designed to mitigate large unexpected adverse moves in the market similar to  many of these strategies are actively managed as the cost of purchasing options can be substantial especially during times of market turbulence in addition the hedges often need to be rebalanced especially in the event of large market moves completion overlays are most often used to line up the overall plan exposure with targets that cannot be achieved through the combination of the underlying investment management mandates either because requiring managers to do so would materially hamper their ability to generate added value or because physical assets are temporarily unavailable to be deployed to achieve those targets for example a plan with a substantial but temporary cash position could employ a completion overlay to equitize the cash position by purchasing equity futures sometimes hedge fund replication strategies and some dynamicallyadjusted liability hedge overlays are also called “completion strategies” as they may be used to accomplish a plan’s overall target market exposures rebalancing overlays are used to implement asset class rebalancing for the overall pension plan typically using derivative instruments the main benefit of these strategies is that they typically allow the realignment of asset class exposure with investment policy targets at a lower transaction cost than using sales of physical securities rebalancing overlay strategies are also potentially less disruptive to the active managers in the pension plan because there is no need to move physical assets between the managers tactical asset allocation overlays taa or global tactical asset allocation overlays gtaa are actively managed strategies and may be part of a rebalancing overlay or standalone mandates instead of deriving the desired market exposures from the strategic asset allocation the targets for these overlays are determined through a quantitative or qualitative investment process resulting in intentional deviations from the strategic longterm allocation interestingly very few investment managers offer all of these various kinds of overlay strategies either individually or as one package most managers have specialized either in passive overlays active overlays or tailrisk hedging key benefits of overlays higher capital efficiency most plans require some level of cash buffer in order to manage contributions and benefit payments so they typically encounter some “cash drag” ie potentially lower expected returns over time for example if a plan maintains  in cash and has an asset allocation that would generally be expected to deliver  to  returns cash drag can be  to  basis points annually – similar in magnitude to all the investment management fees paid by the typical plan in a given year using overlays this drag can be managed as cash can be converted to equity fixed income or some other asset class exposure without detracting significantly from the need for liquidity in fact virtually all of the traditional and exotic beta exposures of a plan can be replicated using synthetic overlays this may allow for additional efficiencies to be gained for example through portable alpha strategies as described earlier these strategies may allow us to combine the risk and factor exposures of multiple asset classes in an effort to generate excess returns lower transaction costs transaction costs using physical securities can be substantial derivative instruments have therefore provided a more efficient way of executing monthtomonth rebalancing activities for plans for example after a strong month in equity performance a plan can have a position in equities that is larger than the exposure called for by the plan’s strategic asset allocation under this circumstance the plan can sell equities outright by redeeming them from one of the underlying asset managers for cash and depositing the cash with a fixed income manager alternatively they can use an overlay strategy to sell equity futures and purchase fixed income futures – potentially reducing transaction costs substantially savings in transaction costs should be weighed against potential basis risk introduced by using derivatives to replicate a physical market exposure for example equity exposure can often be replicated with relatively low tracking error on the other hand replication of other asset classes like fixed income credit often lead to more significant tracking error as such rebalancing overlays may be more effective for relatively small rebalancing transactions larger asset allocation adjustments should usually be implemented through the physical market figure  illustrates the estimated tradeoffs between transaction costs and basis risk   it should be noted that total return swaps can potentially provide both low basis risk and low transaction costs but they present additional hurdles transaction costs can be highly variable and at times of market stress swaps may become unavailable given that they typically consume brokerdealer balance sheet capacity unlike futures further swaps require additional considerations related to rebalancing the exposure over time resizing a futures position is a simple buysell transaction whereas resizing an otc swap requires amending legal swap contracts which can be both cumbersome and costly lastly whether the derivatives are traded on an exchange or over the counter changes in the marktomarket value of the position usually will result in the receipt of collateral or the need to post collateral on a daily basis it follows that a plan making use of such strategies will want to ensure that a sufficient supply of liquid eligible collateral instruments is on hand to satisfy potential margin or collateral calls and that the plan has the required operational and management capabilities to handle the complexities arising from use of derivatives increased precision in risk managementoverlay strategies can also provide additional precision when attempting to reduce different risks in the pension plan pension liabilities are a great example in typical ldi assignments the portfolio manager seeks to construct a portfolio that more or less matches different drivers of liability risk those liability risk factors include duration convexity sensitivity of duration to large changes in yields curve risk and spread exposure among others however the specific targets that must be achieved by an ldi portfolio to control liability risk may be inconsistent with the latitude required by active managers to maintain the potential for value added indeed trying to replicate liability risk factors using physical instruments could force fixed income managers into a fairly narrow segment of the market as illustrated by figure      as figure  shows exclusive use of physical securities may ultimately result in increased concentration risk forced accumulation of unattractive securities and limited potential for alpha given the narrow universe of securities that match the characteristics of the liability discount rate eg barclays us long corporate aa index the ability to incorporate derivatives overlays into an ldi program allows the plan sponsor to expand the physical fixed income investment universe beyond the boundaries implied by liability discount curves while still maintaining the ability to match with liability risk factors in addition these liability risk factors can be expected to fluctuate over time as inputs like discount rates or the demographic profile of the plan change in those circumstances it may be more efficient to rebalance the ldi portfolio towards liability targets using derivatives otherwise the portfolio adjustments would likely lead to relatively small sales and purchases of physical securities that could drive transaction costs up more efficient transition management we estimate that an average plan changes at least one manager every year causing  to  of the plan’s assets to experience some form of transition during these transitions derivative overlays can be used to maintain the desired market exposure for example if a given equity manager is terminated plans may find it useful to ask the manager to liquidate and purchase futures to maintain equity exposure as illustrated earlier this methodology can substantially reduce transaction costs but may result in high basis risk expression of tactical views overlays also can be used to express tactical views one of the recent approaches that we have found to be interesting and applicable to pension plans is to purchase long duration credit securities and create an overlay that is designed to reduce the interest rate duration this way plans can take advantage of the new issuance and availability of long duration corporate credit but at the same time avoid taking additional interest rate risk given the low yield environment figure  illustrates the implementation of the strategy using interest rate swap instruments to create an overlay that reduces interest rate duration in this case we compare the duration of the barclays us aggregate bond index to the combined duration of barclays capital long credit index plus a hypothetical interest rate swap overlay hedge in essence plan sponsors are facing a dilemma when it comes to deploying money into fixed income in the current market environment many plan sponsors want to ultimately increase their allocation to longdated corporate bonds to better match assets with liabilities but also want to delay implementation until rates rise to a certain extent and make yields on these bonds more attractive however long corporate bonds are in short supply relative to potential demand from pension funds and insurance companies and if rates were to rise meaningfully a significant number of plan sponsors who currently sit on the sidelines might try to enter the market at the same time as yields reach more attractive levels this would magnify the supplydemand imbalance existing in the longdated corporate bond market and could make implementation more challenging the use of derivatives can help solve this dilemma by letting plan sponsors accumulate long duration corporate bonds without being exposed to the significant interest rate risk that is typically associated with those securities hedge fund replication lastly some plans are considering replacing part of their hedge fund allocations with hedge fund replication strategies which use algorithms that mimic hedge fund performance these strategies are relatively new but are increasingly being offered by sellside and buyside firms alike it is too early to judge whether these strategies will become a core part of pension plans’ investment roster practical considerations on implementation it is worth noting that these potential benefits also come with some degree of additional risk for example operational risks associated with derivatives can be significant and the changing regulatory landscape may impose unexpected costs especially if pension plans intend to implement the strategies using inhouse resources the first risk to consider is operational risk running derivative overlays requires expertise in execution settlement and collateralization of derivative instruments and very robust processes that support the potentially rapid turnaround times associated with management of the overlay for example collateral calls must be satisfied typically within t or t timeframe or the position may end up being closed invariably for most plans outsourcing the execution of their overlays is the preferred option as they can then rely on the operational expertise of professional asset managers another operational consideration is the fact that communication between parties is typically more frequent for overlay strategies than it is for traditional fullauthority asset management mandates see figure  for example when executing a mandate a rebalancing overlay manager needs access to the client’s overall target asset allocation as well as the market values of each underlying account or mandate it is also likely that any change in asset allocation or cash flow will need to be communicated formally in order to avoid any potential misallocations in the overlay a lack of industrywide communication standards makes effective communication all the more difficult   counterparty and legal risks require specialist expertise to manage a large amount of derivatives trading takes place “over the counter” using individually negotiated agreements which spell out terms such as how collateral is posted and which securities are eligible as collateral instruments it is important that these contracts are negotiated with a great degree of care placed on securing the performance of the counterparty under all market conditions in addition to contractual considerations continuous credit monitoring of all transaction counterparties is important and requires substantial credit analysis resources liquidity and collateral considerations are also extremely important as discussed earlier collateral is typically required for transacting in all derivative instruments as derivative counterparties require periodic exchanges of collateral in order to secure the unrealized gains or losses due to the other party sizing the overlay strategies in relation to available liquid assets is necessary from a riskmanagement perspective as significant market moves can require raising additional liquid assets in a short period of time the degree of liquidity that needs to be held is directly related to the size of the overlay positions volatility of the instruments used and terms of permissible collateral it should be noted that the types of eligible collateral for otc transactions can be negotiated with the counterparties as part of the master agreement and could therefore include nearly any asset type commonly however only cash treasury bills and sometimes treasury bonds are used as collateral prior to the credit crisis many counterparties accepted a wider range of instruments lastly “basis risk” refers to the risk of a given derivative experiencing performance that is deviating from the underlying target instrument as illustrated earlier tradeoffs exist between transaction costs and basis risk it should be noted that over short periods of time basis risk can arise also from instruments that are considered to have virtually no basis risk over the maturity of the instrument for example a total return swap may perform without any basis risk if held to maturity but if it becomes necessary to adjust the size of the position temporary dislocations can force the value of the swap to deviate from the market price of underlying physical instruments another aspect of basis risk is related to the funding cost of the derivative instruments for example if overlays are used to convert sp  equity exposures to russell  small cap exposures and embedded funding cost in the relevant derivative instruments is higher for russell  exposure than sp  exposure the strategy will underperform a similar transaction executed through physical instruments excluding the impact of transaction costs conclusion notwithstanding some of the confusion around terminology overlay strategies have become a mainstay of pension fund management these strategies can be an effective tool for pension managers both in terms of enhancing return opportunities and assisting in reduction of unwanted risks there are multiple considerations for each strategy however and a careful assessment of both the potential benefits risks and costs should be conducted prior to
