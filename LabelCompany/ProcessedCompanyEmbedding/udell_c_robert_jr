udell jr  fairnessfairpoint navigation open letter to consolidated ceo c robert udell jr amy masciolaupdateleave a comment january   c robert udell jr president and ceo consolidated communications inc  south th street mattoon il  dear mr udell as employees of fairpoint communications we look forward to a constructive and cooperative relationship with the consolidated communications management team we believe we all share the goal of providing the best quality service to our customers across maine new hampshire and vermont to achieve that objective we believe consolidated should take three crucial steps  reinstate recently laidoff workers in order to maintain high standards of customer service  analyze fairpoint’s history of poor management and abusive actions toward employees in order to avoid repeating them and  halt reorganization of the company until after the sale is finalized in order to make sure all changes are serving the longterm good of customers workers and the company as a whole fairpoint’s decision to lay off more than  percent of the workforce in less than  months has compromised our ability to provide the service customers need and has deeply affected employee morale the company’s  effort to slash labor costs and replace skilled experienced workers with inexperienced temporary workers led to a historic fourmonth strike which ended in a union victory in february  however fairpoint turned around and laid off more than  percent of the workforce—all in all cutting more than  percent of employees since  inevitably fewer workers have meant cuts in the quality of service and increases in customer complaints the only way to restore quality service and workers’ loyalty to the company is to bring back those critical lost jobs we believe the long strained often abusive relationship between fairpoint management and employees will improve if consolidated takes seriously some lessons from fairpoint’s history in  when tiny north carolinabased fairpoint bought verizon’s northern new england assets executives promised to add  new jobs members of the ibew and cwa strongly opposed the acquisition fearing the company was taking on too much debt and that it had no experience managing a transaction of that magnitude or the complex operations required in the northern new england landscape the acquisition went through and fairpoint went bankrupt in  poor management decisions multiplied for the next seven years as fairpoint cut approximately  jobs across all of its operations refused to invest in its network and watched customer service and profits lag behind its industry peers today investigations and fines are on the horizon for the company in maine and vermont where regulators oversee telecommunications services finally the latest company reorganization will only compound and accelerate the degradation of service initiated by employee layoffs we are being asked to do more for our customers with dramatically fewer resources you simply cannot eliminate more than one third of the workforce and expect to provide quality service as workers on the front lines we are incredulous that the company’s priority from day one has not been improving and expanding telecommunications service in our communities but instead lining the pockets of vulture capitalists who will see a massive windfall in the sale to consolidated layoffs bad faith mismanagement and disregard for customers and employees must end if the consolidated communications purchase of fairpoint is to succeed we hope you will take this opportunity to turn the page on eight disastrous years and begin a new era of cooperation with workers in order to put customers first we also urge you to use your considerable influence with fairpoint ceo paul sunu to immediately recall all workers who’ve been laid off since the spring of  and to postpone corporate reorganization until after a sale is finalized sincerely employees of fairpoint communications members of the
