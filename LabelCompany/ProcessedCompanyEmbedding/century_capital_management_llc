value strategy about century the firm investment professionals marketing and client service contact us smid growth strategy investment team don bisson cfa is the portfolio manager for the century smid growth strategy he is supported by century’s equity analysts and traders the team conducts fundamental bottomup research analysis on existing and prospective holdings the research analysts have dedicated gics sector coverage we believe that this dedicated focus leads to strong knowledge and experience which we think enhances the smid growth investment process each equity analyst has deep experience researching companies as a result each of them has developed an extensive list of company and industry contacts along with domain expertise that we believe are valuable when researching companies the team’s approach to company research is intensive with the portfolio manager and equity analysts each having a goal to meet with  companies per year investment philosophy the smid growth investment philosophy is based on the premise that capital will flow to sectors of the market where returns on invested capital roic are above average andor rising the investment team believes that the small and mid cap segments of the market are inefficient and provide opportunities to utilize fundamental bottomup research to identify superior growth companies and misvaluations the smid growth investment approach is fundamental bottomup in nature investment universe the smid growth market capitalization range is mostly between  million to  billion at purchase fundamental research the smid growth strategy invests in  types of investment opportunities  “core companies” which exhibit a strong competitive advantage above average margins and returns on capital and above average earnings per share and sales growth  “underestimations” where the opportunity set is large andor expanding rapidly earnings estimates and returns on capital are typically rising and we believe the market has underestimated revenue and earnings potential for the company and  “overreactions” or “fallen angels” where a growth company has experienced a temporary setback we believe the negative news associated with the company is fully discounted in the share price and we are comfortable with the fundamental milestones we have created for tracking the recovery process for the company  buy decisions result from the company matching one of the three types of growth opportunities we emphasize valuation valuation is an important part of the buy process with each company put through a rigorous proprietary intrinsic valuation analysis the investment team incorporates two proprietary methodologies to measure valuation  a discounted cash flow or “eva” model and  a dividend discount model “ddm” the “eva” and “ddm” analysis are complemented by  a comparable company analysis and  a historical relative pe valuation to qualify for purchase the portfolio manager targets at least a  discount to intrinsic valuation for established core growth underestimated growth and temporary overreaction growth companies portfolio construction there are typically  holdings in the smid growth portfolio the portfolio is flat in the sense that weightings for individual holdings usually represent about  of the portfolio with the top  holdings typically accounting for roughly  of the total portfolio the rationale is that with roughly a  weighting for each stock all holdings are equally important the portfolio manager typically diversifies holdings across sectors and monitors portfolio characteristics relative to the russell  growth index however sector weightings may vary significantly from the index sell discipline the portfolio manager utilizes a comprehensive sell discipline designed to control risk and limit the impact of a single stock on the performance of the entire portfolio each holding has a price target that’s generated by our valuation approach the following may trigger a sale  a permanent deterioration of fundamentals  overvaluation and technical deterioration  better opportunities are available  a position size exceeds  or  market capitalization rises above a targeted level print

with the portfolio manager and equity analysts each having a goal to meet with  companies per year investment philosophy century’s small cap value investment philosophy has four primary tenets small capitalization markets are inefficient this provides an opportunity to utilize a fundamental research approach to identify superior companies trading at a discount to intrinsic value in the context of value investing it is important to delineate between less innovative and more innovative sectors focus on opportunities with the greatest upside potential emphasizing a combination of both classic valuation and relative valuationearnings power neutralize relative benchmark risk to isolate stock selection as the primary source of alpha mitigating the difficulty of consistently predicting market sector and industry direction while delivering high active share investment universe the small cap value market capitalization range is generally within the range of the russell  value rv index typically  million to  billion fundamental research the strategy’s fundamental research process includes both financial modeling and qualitative analysis the model is designed to develop an understanding of a company’s operating dynamics financials margins and growth rates and perform various scenario and sensitivity analyses the strategy’s qualitative analysis is focused around researching the key drivers of the business the portfolio manager analyzes the industry’s competitive landscape speaks with company management and listens to past earnings calls the company specific research is further complemented with a formal sector profile designed to focus on the key catalysts driving sector dynamics valuation the strategy’s primary valuation methodology is a discounted cash flow dcf model once the dcf analysis is completed the portfolio manager considers the output within the context of less innovative and more innovative sectors in less innovative sectors we compare a company’s intrinsic value to the current stock price in more innovative sectors we compare a company’s intrinsic value to street estimates and the deviation between the two portfolio construction the portfolio manager constructs a portfolio typically consisting of  companies larger positions generally range from  –  and tend to exhibit high expected return potential and a positive contribution to risk smaller positions typically range from  –  the risk and return profile can be higher or more moderate if the return profile is high the smaller position is generally based on the desired sector or industry exposure relative to the benchmark from a portfolio construction standpoint sell discipline the portfolio manager utilizes a comprehensive and flexible sell discipline the following may
