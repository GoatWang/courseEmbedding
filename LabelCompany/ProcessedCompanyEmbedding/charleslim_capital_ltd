to persons accessing this information i agree xssmmdlg charleslim capital about us introduction senior team advisers investment management investment philosophy leadership contact investment philosophy we prioritise the independence to manage capital according to our core principles i investing in tomorrow’s world we seek to invest in the best businesses in the context of the world economy of the future such businesses often have significant presence in asia and are in solid industries that benefit from economic technological demographic and social transitions that continue to shape the world our bias is towards investing in and partnering with companies that we regard as “blue chips of tomorrow” ii concentrated investing for the longterm we seek to invest like business owners we focus capital on our best ideas through careful selection of businesses and limiting the number of investments our longterm approach enables us to invest effectively through industry cycles business that are built to last devalue little from a year or two of turmoil often gaining sustainable advantages instead in our view shortterm uncertainties often create longerterm opportunities for the farsighted and patient investor with holding power iii fundamental discipline we seek out value preferably deep value and quality at all times we undertake intensive focused and ontheground research for a deep understanding of the industries countries and companies that we invest in downside risks are evaluated as much as upside potential and capital preservation is paramount we undertake independent and sensible analysis for superior understanding and conviction regardless of consensus opinion iv independent and original thinking independent perspectives and thought leadership in the areas of relevance to our investments are core to our strategy many of the best investment opportunities may lie in quality companies that are underresearched or misunderstood that are in transition and not wellsuited to be valued by public markets or that require nonstandard assessments of valuation and its future prospects v partnership and coinvestment we seek genuine longterm partnerships and relationships with investee companies and clients we are focused on managing longterm capital and generally do not employ leverage in investing to enable us to capture longterm opportunities especially in time of pessimism or market dislocations and to have superior holding power ” the right method in investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which one thinks one knows something about  it is a mistake to think that one limits one’s risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence ”
