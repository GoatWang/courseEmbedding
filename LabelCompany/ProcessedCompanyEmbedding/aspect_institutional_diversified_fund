follower aspect capital rolls with the punches after some recent difficult years the londonbased firm makes the case for its strategy as a liquid diversifier for institutional investors by david turner punch down blocks sit inside a comms room at an office in london photo credit chris ratcliffebloomberg many asset managers suffered in the third quarter of this year when stock and commodity markets plummeted worldwide but for aspect capital a  billion specialist in systematic trend following it was a good time the londonbased firms  million aspect diversified fund achieved a  percent return by shorting energy and metals aspect uses computerbased models to identify incipient market trends and jump on them the diversified funds recent performance built on a strong  when it gained  percent by going short on oil and long on bonds such as german bunds and us treasuries at the right time but aspect ceo anthony todd and president and research director martin lueck arent resting on their laurels they remember the tough times of  and  when a lack of sustained rises and falls in most markets led to losses of  percent and  percent respectively for the diversified fund the strategy also slumped by  percent this april thanks to a sharp reversal in equity markets that bucked the trend of rising prices identified in aspects models thanks to its strong third quarter the fund was still up  percent for the year at the end of october todd and lueck helped pioneer trend following in the uk in the s and cofounded aspect back in  but they still think they have a lot to learn about how market trends work trend following forever requires updating and evolution because markets evolve lueck explains hence the strong research and development team he watches over  more than half of the firms member staff mostly aimed at global institutional investors and funds of hedge funds but also at individual highnetworth clients through distribution partnerships the diversified fund is part of aspects diversified programme strategy which accounts for the bulk of the firms assets this strategy also guides  billion in separate accounts the  million aspect diversified trends fund a european mutual fund under the ucits structure that includes a mix of institutional and retail money the  million aspect institutional diversified fund and the  million equinox aspect core diversified strategy fund the latter two vehicles are an erisacompliant offering for us retirement plans and a  act mutual fund respectively the ucits fund which aspect primarily sells in europe has proved particularly attractive to multimanager diversified growth funds and wealth management firms the  act fund is available to us institutions but its main target is us platforms that can distribute it to retail investors and their advisers todd and luecks experience as trend followers goes back much farther than the founding of aspect the two men studied physics together at the university of oxford with another bright student named michael adam after graduation lueck and adam went to work for adams father a sugar importer based in london one day in  old man adam handed his son a book of technical trading models and said see if theres anything in these lueck recalls so together we developed some rudimentary computer models and discovered trend following they had unwittingly reinvented the wheel we didnt know there was already an industry doing this in the us lueck says four years later lueck adam and fellow trendfollowing expert david harding founded londonbased adam harding and lueck a trendfollowing investment house where todd came to work as head of financial engineering and product development ahls client base was predominantly highnetworth individuals along with some funds of funds the firm attracted relatively little direct institutional money in  the firm was acquired by man group the uk alternativeinvestment giant man ahl as its now called manages  billion or nearly one quarter of parent man groups assets lueck and harding departed ahl in  todd the following year in  harding founded londonbased winton capital management a trendfollowing commodity trading adviser that is now one of the worlds biggest hedge fund firms with more than  billion in assets todd and lueck decided it was time to bring the systematic trendfollowing approach to the institutional investor community we started aspect with the belief that this should be in every institutional investors portfolio lueck says when making the case for why institutions should care about trendfollowing funds todd doesnt cite performance but since its  inception through this august the diversified fund had posted an  percent average annual return compared with  percent for the cisdm cta equal weighted index a measurement of returns for commoditytrading advisers which pursue trendfollowing strategies its a liquid source of diversification for clients portfolios  its that lack of correlation that is good todd asserts the funds average correlation with stocks is pretty much zero he estimates but the correlation is dynamic it changes depending on the trend that aspect is following todd explains that the firms trendfollowing strategy hinges on pinpointing and acting on mediumterm trends of two to six months using an automated system based on the principle of serial autocorrelation or the tendency for todays price movement to be slightly influenced by what happened yesterday and what happened last month the diversified fund trades in about  highly liquid financial instruments in  markets most of them futures contracts including those for stock indexes such as the sp  commodities like brent crude and interest rates aspects trend following can involve shorting or buying into markets for example the diversified fund generated a  percent return in  by shorting equities and commodities and going long fixedincome at other times the fund has switched into a positive correlation with stocks purchasing them on the expectation that they will rise aspect which opened new york and hong kong offices in  and  respectively has attracted a diverse range of clients about  percent of the firms assets come from institutions including pension funds insurers and sovereign wealth funds with another  percent from funds of funds and the rest from distribution deals with wealth managers and private banks europe accounts for about  percent of total assets with another  percent from the middle east  percent from asia and  percent from north america if the unique selling point of trend following is diversification aspect must keep turning over fresh stones to find it the world has become a slightly more homogenous place over the time ive been doing this todd says correlations between different markets have gone up over the past  or  years his solution keep going into new areas that are not yet highly linked with global financial markets with that goal in mind aspects research team is doing simulated trading in chinese futures contracts that were until recently barred to foreign investors including plastics glass and eggs besides offering diversification such instruments meet the firms other key criterion these contracts are extremely liquid lueck says sponsored video get started subscribe

equinox investment philosophy and process at equinox funds we believe that alternative and traditional investment portfolios built around rigorous diversification and dynamic risk management can add longterm value to an investment strategy with this philosophy in mind the equinox portfolio management team employs the following sixstep investment process  screen after determining a fund or program’s goals and objectives the portfolio team screens the manager universe for suitable candidates  analyze during this stage the portfolio team seeks to rigorously evaluate historical performance and portfolio attributes as they relate to performance volatility and strategy discipline  select the next step involves performing exhaustive due diligence on organization personnel investment process and operations  construct at this stage of the process the anticipated portfolio is stressed using simulation tools for optimal return risk correlation and drawdown metrics  manage once the initial candidates are identified the portfolio team continually rebuilds the universe of managers and retests the portfolio dynamics  rebalance continuous monitoring of existing managers’ trading and performance seeks to detect style drift or other potential issues and rebalancing occurs as necessary throughout the process our goal is to provide investors with highquality alternative investment

institutional investors the newcits is an onshore variant of the firm’s aspect diversified program the offshore fund being aspect diversified fund  a systematic product that uses trading algorithms to capture momentum in mediumterm trends across a range of deep liquid futures markets speaking with hedgeweek aspect capital’s sales manager for uk and europe ted frith said the performance of the diversified trends newcits would be “almost identical” to its offshore counterpart and would have the same risk target “we intend to minimize tracking error and surprise” said frith “the volatility target will be  per cent” in bloomberg’s top performing funds in  the aspect diversified fund ranked  generating  per cent returns frith confirmed that the fund had already attracted interest in germany and italy “we have three external investors already and a further dozen are looking to finalise due diligence in the next two to four weeks” the fund will be marketed to institutions in scandinavia and possibly france but anticipates less demand from uk institutional investors traditionally german investors have found it difficult to invest in offshore funds but as more hedgies adopt the cloak of transparency under ucits iii regulations it appears alternative onshore strategies such as the aspect newcits are now on their radar “german investors have traditionally focused on the fixed income world which has started to become a problem for a number of schemes” said frith adding that falling bond yields are causing them to open up to the idea of using managed futures to diversify their portfolios aspect built the fund inhouse “we’ve listened to clients’ gripes about costs counterparty risk tracking issues taken this feedback onboard and designed a superior product” explained frith aspect’s ceo anthony todd pictured said “i am confident that the aspect diversified trends fund will prove to be an extremely competitive and attractive option to a wide range of investors” the main advantage to this is that aspect can be rigorous when choosing service providers those chosen with aspect as investment manager include quintillion the fund’s independent administrator bny mellon as custodian and kpmg for auditing quintillion along with aspect will independently value the fund’s derivatives contracts daily with newedge appointed as swap counterparty
