under management in one of the mutual funds described above depending upon the risk profile and investment objectives of the underlying client  when that occurs afcm receives management fees from the individual managed account for investing in one of the funds and fees for managing the funds itself  in both instances afcm is being compensated on the basis of a percentage of assets under management  this ability to collect fees from the individual managed accounts and from the mutual funds provides an incentive for mr gonsalves to recommend that a client invest in one of the above described funds and could be considered a conflict of interest on the part of afcm and mr gonsalves mr gonsalves attempts to minimize this potential conflict of interest by recommending afcmmanaged mutual funds to a client only if such client’s investment portfolio allocation needs fit the investment profile of the specific funds being recommended  absent such an investment profile mr gonsalves
