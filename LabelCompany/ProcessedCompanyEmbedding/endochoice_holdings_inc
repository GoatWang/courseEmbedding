cik  we estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately  million or  million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us the principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to support our operations create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate future access to the public equity markets we currently expect to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to fund the commercialization and continued development of our fuse® system as follows • approximately  million for the expansion of our sales and marketing activities including hiring new direct sales representatives • approximately  million for increases in working capital requirements related to accounts receivable and inventory • approximately  million for capital expenditures for new product demonstration equipment including colon models and other simulation equipment used by our sales representatives and other personnel for fuse® product demonstrations to gi specialists • approximately  million for investments to expand our manufacturing capacity as sales of our fuse® system and other products increase in the future which will include the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets related primarily to the manufacturing of our fuse® system and our other products and • the remainder for other general corporate purposes in addition we may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire and invest in complementary products technologies services or businesses however we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such transaction nor are we involved in negotiations to do so our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current intentions based upon our plans and business condition as of the date of this prospectus we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above the amounts and timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors as a result management will have broad discretion in its application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on our judgment in such application pending use of the net proceeds from this offering we may invest in short and intermediateterm interestbearing obligations investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us government although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements we believe that the net proceeds from this offering together with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations into  this estimate assumes that we will enter into definitive documentation for the  million proposed new credit facility to replace our existing credit facilities and increase our borrowing availability we entered into a commitment letter for the proposed new credit facility in may  the closing and funding of the proposed new credit facility is conditioned upon among other things our completion of an initial public offering raising at least  million of net proceeds however this offering is not conditioned on the availability of the proposed new credit facility we cannot be certain that we will enter into the proposed new credit facility or that the terms and conditions described herein will be the final terms and conditions if we enter into the proposed new credit facility if we fail to finalize and execute definitive documentation for the proposed new credit facility our liquidity may be adversely impacted and we expect that our cash after the completion of this offering and borrowing availability will only be sufficient to fund our operations until the middle of  in the event the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock in the offering we will not receive any of the proceeds from any shares of common stock sold by the selling stockholders we believe the market for endoscopy products and services is fragmented and underserved by our competitors as such we believe that we are in a unique position as the only company exclusively focused on servicing the entire gi procedure cycle through our broad and innovative product platform many of our competitors are either large multinational companies for which gi represents only a portion of a larger business or niche players focused on a small portion of the market accordingly our competitors are generally varied as to product and service lines as categorized below imaging systems in the imaging market our significant competitors include flexible endoscope manufacturers such as olympus fujifilm and pentax which together represent a significant portion of the gi endoscopy market in particular each of these significant competitors have products that directly compete with our fuse® system including evis exera iii from olympus expx from fujifilm and pentax’s retroview colonoscope there is also the potential for new entrants to the market particularly those based in china as manufacturing capabilities grow therapeutic devices in the device market our significant competitors include boston scientific cook medical olympus medivatorscantel and sterisus endoscopy all of which sell gi endoscopy devices at any time these and other potential market entrants may develop new devices or treatment alternatives that may compete directly with our gi products infection control products in the infection control market our significant competitors include medivatorscantel ruhof medline cardinal health and sterisus endoscopy all of which sell infection control products that directly compete with our product offerings including procedure kits personal protection products enzymatics and highlevel disinfectants diagnostics the diagnostics market including pathology services is highly fragmented our primary competitors include gi groups with inoffice pathology labs independent pathology labs hospitalbased pathology labs and large diagnostic companies including labcorp and quest diagnostics even with our broad platform of products and services our ability to compete effectively will depend on the acceptance and use of our products by gi specialists in addition in the future we may compete with alternative gi disease screening methods including the noninvasive testing methods described below stool tests some western european countries have introduced a preliminary step before colonoscopy into their prescribed screening programs in these countries the patient is first asked to perform an “at home” stool test referred to as either a fecal occult blood test or fobt or fecal immunochemical test or fit a physician interprets the results and if positive the patient is instructed to proceed to a colonoscopy in the united states fobt and fit are sometimes used as adjuncts to colonoscopy but insurance companies generally do not require their use prior to screening colonoscopy fda recently approved a noninvasive dnabased stool test for use in the united states as an alternative option to screen for colorectal cancer the newly approved product detects hemoglobin a protein molecule that is a component of blood as well as certain mutations associated with colorectal cancer in the dna of cells shed by advanced adenomas as stool moves through the large intestine and rectum if a polyp or colon cancer is detected through a stool test the patient is instructed to proceed to a colonoscopy procedure pill camera other competitors have introduced pill camera technologies as another alternative method of screening the gi tract for polyps in this screening method the patient swallows a pill that houses a battery light and lenses which travels through the gi tract while wirelessly transmitting images to a specialist the patient must limit physical activity during the approximate  hours that it takes the pill to travel through the gi tract if any colon abnormalities are detected through pill camera screening the patient is instructed to proceed to a colonoscopy procedure radiology scans another alternative procedure to screen for precancerous polyps is use of scans including computed tomography or ct or magnetic resonance imaging or mri scans in both cases a specialist takes a scan of the patient’s gi tract and analyzes the results for the presence of any colon abnormalities if any colon abnormalities are detected the patient is instructed to proceed to a colonoscopy procedure we do not believe that these alternative methods will replace endoscopy as the primary screening method for gi disease yet if they are adopted by a greater number of specialists and physicians our business may be negatively impacted while the advent of these types of noninvasive tests is potentially competitive we also believe that these types of tests could drive further awareness of gi diseases and possibly lead to an increase in colonoscopies as the national colorectal cancer roundtable seeks to achieve its goal of increasing colorectal cancer screening rates from approximately  to  by  company description we are a medical device company focused exclusively on designing and commercializing a platform of innovative products for gastrointestinal or gi caregivers we currently serve over  gi departments that perform endoscopic procedures which represent approximately onethird of the us market we offer a comprehensive range of products and services that span singleuse devices and infection control products pathology and imaging systems in december  we began limited commercialization of our fuse® full spectrum endoscopy system or fuse® our fuse® system enables gi specialists to see more than twice the anatomy at any one time compared to standard forwardviewing colonoscopes and has been clinically demonstrated to detect  more precancerous polyps than standard colonoscopes we believe our commitment to continuing innovation and focus on gi specialists provides us with the unique capability to meet their evolving needs we intend to leverage our broad product platform established customer relationships commercial infrastructure and fuse® technology to set a new standard of care for the global gi market we estimate that the addressable worldwide market for our gi endoscopy products and services is over  billion with more than  million gi endoscopies performed each year in the united states japan and europe combined we estimate that the addressable market for our gi endoscopy products and services is growing at  annually driven by increased governmental and payor focus on screening prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer and other gi conditions an aging global population and changing dietary habits gi endoscopies involve inserting a thin tube containing a camera or cameras into a natural orifice of the patient to examine the upper or lower gi tract in order to screen for diagnose and treat various gi conditions including colorectal cancer gi endoscopies require a large number of steps including setup imaging therapy specimen retrieval pathology and endoscope disinfection and repair which we refer to collectively as the gi procedure cycle the gi endoscopy market is highly fragmented and served by numerous companies many of which focus on only one or two areas of the gi procedure cycle we believe the needs of gi specialists are currently underserved due to the lack of a comprehensive provider solely focused on innovation in the gi endoscopy market we founded our company to serve the evolving needs of gi specialists by continually bringing to market a broad suite of innovative products across the gi procedure cycle since we began our commercial operations in  we have developed an extensive line of devices and infection control products and have added pathology and scope repair services capabilities our products and services are designed to improve clinical outcomes and gi specialist productivity for example our cinchpad® product improved the transport process of endoscopes after use and eliminated the need to clean contaminated transport trays in  we acquired peer medical ltd which was developing a new endoscope system that we now call fuse® our focus on product innovation and services that span the gi endoscopy procedure cycle has enabled our direct salesforce to penetrate approximately onethird of the gi departments in the united states in just six years while increasing our sales per customer over that time our products are used in colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy or egd and other procedures of the upper gi tract which represent approximately  million and  million annual procedures in the united states respectively and together account for  of all gi endoscopic procedures colonoscopy is used for the screening surveillance and diagnosis of gi diseases including colorectal cancer inflammatory bowel disease and gi bleeding colorectal cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the united states with approximately  new patients diagnosed and over  deaths in the united states each year however colorectal cancer is considered one of the most preventable cancers as precancerous polyps typically take approximately  years to progress into cancer colonoscopy enables precancerous polyps to be identified and removed early in their progression as a result colonoscopy is considered the gold standard in colorectal cancer screening and has wellestablished reimbursement in most developed countries furthermore the national colorectal cancer roundtable has set a goal to increase colorectal cancer screening rates for specified demographics from approximately  currently to  by  although colonoscopy is the most accurate and comprehensive method for colorectal cancer screening multiple clinical studies have found that gi specialists using standard forwardviewing endoscopes fail to identify up to  of precancerous polyps our fuse® system which is intended for visualization of the gi tract and related therapeutic interventions enables a wider field of view for upper and lower endoscopy procedures specifically the fuse® colonoscope offers a ° view of the colon during colonoscopy instead of the ° to ° view offered by standard colonoscopes this enables the gi specialist to visualize more than twice the anatomy at any one time as compared to a standard colonoscope and improves the ability to more thoroughly examine the colon without prolonging the time to complete the colonoscopy according to the results of a company sponsored and funded tandem clinical trial published in the lancet oncology gi specialists using fuse® during colonoscopy identified  more precancerous polyps than when using standard endoscopes the improved detection is clinically important not only because the precancerous polyp is removed during the procedure but also because clinical guidelines recommend more frequent colonoscopies following initial detection of precancerous polyps further we believe that increased adoption of fuse® for colorectal cancer screening could result in significant savings to healthcare payors given the high cost of colorectal cancer related surgical intervention and subsequent treatment the costs of surgeries and related care can be significant with total costs to the us healthcare system estimated to exceed  billion per year since the company’s founding in  we have grown our number of gi department customers in the united states from nearly  in  to over  today in addition to our direct salesforces in the united states and germany our products are sold by
