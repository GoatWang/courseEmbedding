note the following essay was written by creightons richard hauser sj shortly after the terrorist attacks of sept   and appeared in the winter  issue of creighton university magazine where is your god a reflection by richard j hauser sj my tears have become my bread by night by day as i hear it said all the daylong “where is your god” — psalm  a few days after the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon i was accosted by a very troubled woman who steadfastly asserted “there are no accidents god’s plan is perfect everything happens for a reason” then she waited for my assent to her declarations what to say how can i respond in a way that speaks to the suffering of this woman her faith is the foundation of her life and her faith teaches her that god is not only allloving but also allpowerful doesn’t this mean that everything that happens in this world is somehow willed by god don’t these events — terrible as they are — also fall within divine providence as i look at this good woman i am touched nothing in her life is more important than faith she clings to it even though it leads to a terrible conclusion god — somehow or other in a perfect plan — wanted this to happen her world view is being pushed to the breaking point but she will not give up her faith i admire her i begin responding tentatively wanting to help but fearful of upsetting her further yes i too believe that god is allloving and allpowerful but i don’t believe god wanted this to happen god did not cause the events of sept  people did god created us in god’s own image making us “a little less than gods crowned with glory and honor” ps  and god allpowerful and allloving blessed us with the gift that makes us most like god freedom and from the very beginning of creation god allowed us to use this gift as mature adults absolutely not like puppets manipulated on a string god doesn’t limit human freedom but sadly from the very beginning human beings have abused this gift of freedom and rebelled against god’s commandments humans sinned in the garden of eden — adam and eve humans sinned in new york and washington on sept  and so this lovely planet god’s garden of paradise becomes a vale of tears throughout history when confronting suffering nonbelievers have taunted believers justifying nonbelief with the psalmist’s painful lament “where is your god” but believers confronting the same suffering reaching deep within their hearts have come to a different conclusion our god is with us in suffering indeed especially in suffering so rabbi harold kushner finally concluded as he struggled to reconcile his belief in an allloving and allpowerful god with the premature death of his son at age  god was not to blame “maybe god does not cause our suffering maybe it happens for some reason other than the will of god the psalmist writes ‘i lift mine eyes to the hills from where does my help come my help comes from the lord maker of heaven and earth’ ps  he does not say ‘my pain comes from the lord’ or ‘my tragedy comes from the lord’ he says ‘my help comes from the lord’ could it be that god does not cause the bad things that happen to us  could it be that ‘how could god do this to me’ is really the wrong question” when bad things happen to good people avon books  so paul concluded reflecting on his experience of coping with his “thorn in the flesh” paul discovered to his complete astonishment that his weakness which some scholars believe was encroaching blindness did not indicate god’s absence but actually occasioned a fuller manifestation of god’s presence “about this thing the thorn i have pleaded with the lord three times for it to leave me but he has said ‘my grace is enough for you my power is at its best in weakness’ so i shall be very happy to make my weakness my special boast so that the power of christ may stay over me and that is why i am quite content with my weaknesses and with insults hardships persecutions and the agonies i go through for christ’s sake for it is when i am weak that i am strong”  cor  later facing martyrdom in rome paul exulted “who will separate us from the love of christ trial or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or the sword  i am certain that neither death nor life  nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of god that comes to us in christ jesus our lord” rom   and so jesus discovered on easter morning after the ordeal of good friday his most dear father never abandoning him had raised him from the dead — transfigured and glorified where was our god during our national tragedy our god in christ was with us with us in the hearts of our grieving praying nation with all working to alleviate suffering of fellow citizens neighbors friends with the sootcovered exhausted rescue workers with the firemen laying down their lives the jesuit poet gerard manley hopkins in his poem “kingfishers” catches the mystery of our god’s presence to us in christ especially in suffering for christ plays in ten thousand places lovely in limbs and lovely in eyes not his to the father through the features of men’s faces about the author fr hauser is a professor theology director of the masters program in christian spirituality and rector of the jesuit community at creighton he is also the author of several books including finding god in troubled times the holy spirit  suffering profile richard j hauser sj personal profile photograph by don doll sj for over  years fr hauser has celebrated a candlelight mass on sunday evenings at  pm in st johns church on creightons campus taken from theologue the creighton graduate student newsletter by gail ritsch graduate and former student students enrolled in the graduate theology program initially know frdick hauser as the director of the program the official point of contactcommunication and correspondence before long students come to know hauser as much more than a figure who merely represents officialdom he becomes advisor mentor friend confidant and coach he is in fact the longtime founderpatron of the graduate theology program and its students hauser the eldest of six children was born raised and schooled in milwaukee wisconsin after graduation from high school in  he entered the society of jesus and began the long steady and scholarly course that leads a jesuit not only to ordination but to a variety of experiences and tasks that intend to give greater glory to god he was ordained in  when vatican iis spirit of aggiornamento was beginning to take root within the hearts minds and lives of the people of god it is easy to see how hausers current emphasis on human experience dialog and the holy spirit could have been stimulated and nourished by the postvatican ii theological climate the themes presented in all three of his main publications in his spirit moving in the spirit and finding god in troubled times could be described as representative of the spirit of vatican ii and a retrieval of early christian thought hauser intended to become a high school history teacher but his work giving retreats for college students while teaching at st louis university in the late s set him on a different course of study and service spirituality this interest took him to the catholic university of america from which he was awarded a ph d in religion and religious education in  his dissertation compared abraham maslow and thomas merton in their approaches to religious experience everyone who takes a class with hauser or reads his books becomes familiar with ideas drawn from that dissertation maslows notion of peak experience and mertons language of the false self and the true self among his main professional interests he lists contemporary spirituality discernment of spirits mysticism and suffering hauser has been teaching theology at creighton since  from  he served as chair of the theology department resuming the chair in may  from  he served as a residentstudent dormitory chaplain his courses in personal prayer and dealing with suffering are popular among both undergraduate and graduate students currently he is director of all three masters degree programs theology ministry and christian spirituality he served as associate director of the christian spirituality program since its inception twentythree years ago and became its director in  hauser looks after all three of these graduate programs and the students involved with more than administrative care he truly enjoys getting to know students their life experience and career goals and helping students overcome obstacles financial and otherwise to a masters degree hausers role as educator extends beyond the immediate creighton community his themes of finding god in daily life personal prayer and dealing with suffering regularly take him away from the formal classroom i do loads of adult education around the area and nationally    as a kind of ambassador of creighton to the outside world he understands the university as a resource institution and believes that we have a mission to serve the entire area and beyond giving retreats for priests is another dimension of his work in spirituality that has developed in recent years graduate students may not be aware of the fact that hauser regularly presides at a special candlelight mass every sunday of the academic year at  pm in st johns church furthermore has been doing this since  approximately  students gather each sunday night for this studentcentered studentplanned celebration which hauser very thoughtfully describes as his most religious most pastoral experience of the week hauser routinely jogs a few miles through the neighborhood surrounding creightons campus its relaxing and its good for me he says he likes to read i have a pile of books and usually winds down after a long day by watching nightline and a seinfeld rerun he loves to travel and tries to take time off in california at the end of each summer when he cannot get that far away he gratefully settles for a few hours or days in the countryside of nebraska a quote from merton new seeds of contemplation provides a fitting conclusion to this profile as well as an apt description of the character and work of fr dick hauser the highest vocation in the kingdom of god is that of sharing ones contemplation with others and bringing others to the experimental knowledge of god   the best you can do is write something or say something that will serve as an occasion for someone else to realize what god wants    go back to theology
