coexpression often achieves optimal yield solubility and activity and may protect individual subunits from degradation the duet vectors are t promoter expression vectors each designed to coexpress two target proteins in e coli the duet vectorscarry compatible replicons and antibiotic resistance markers and may be used together in appropriate host strains to coexpress up to eight proteins certain combinations of duet vectors and pet or petcoco™ vectors are also compatible for coexpression the capability of duet vectors to be cotransformed propagated and induced for robust target proteincoexpression makes them ideal for the analysis of protein complexes the duet vectors are designed with compatible replicons and drug resistance genes for effective propagation and maintenance of four plasmids in a single cell petduet is designed for the coexpression of two target genes the vector encodes two multiple cloning sites mcs each of which is preceded by a t promoter lac operator and ribosome binding site rbs the vector also carries the pbrderived cole replicon laci gene and ampicillin resistance gene this vector can be transformed into the same cell with pacycduet™ pcdfduet™ and prsfduet™ or pcoladuet™ in the appropriate host strain for the coexpression of up to eight target genes genes inserted into mcs can be sequenced using the petupstream primer and duetdown primer

optimal yield solubility and activity and may protect individual subunits from degradation the duet vectors are t promoter expression vectors each designed to coexpress two target proteins in e coli the duet vectorscarry compatible replicons and antibiotic resistance markers and may be used together in appropriate host strains to coexpress up to eight proteins certain combinations of duet vectors and pet or petcoco™ vectors are also compatible for coexpression the capability of duet vectors to be cotransformed propagated and induced for robust target proteincoexpression makes them ideal for the analysis of protein complexes the duet vectors are designed with compatible replicons and drug resistance genes for effective propagation and maintenance of four plasmids in a single cell petduet is designed for the coexpression of two target genes the vector encodes two multiple cloning sites mcs each of which is preceded by a t promoter lac operator and ribosome binding site rbs the vector also carries the pbrderived cole replicon laci gene and ampicillin resistance gene this vector can be transformed into the same cell with pacycduet™ pcdfduet™ and prsfduet™ or pcoladuet™ in the appropriate host strain for the coexpression of up to eight target genes genes inserted into mcs can be sequenced using the petupstream primer and duetdown primer genes inserted into mcs can be sequenced using the duetup primer and t terminator primer commercial use of this product requires a commercial license from emd millipore corporation commercial use shall include but not be limited to
