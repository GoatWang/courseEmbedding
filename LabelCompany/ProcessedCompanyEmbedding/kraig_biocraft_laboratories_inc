expands domestic spider silk production capacity kraig labs installing new silk processing equipment to speed up delivery times for spider silk ann arbor mich – april   – kraig biocraft laboratories inc otcqb kblb “company” the leading developer of spider silk based fibers announced today that it is expanding domestic recombinant spider silk production capacity with the purchase and installation of a new commercial scale cocoon processing machine  this new equipment arrived in early april is being installed now and is expected to be fully operational before the end of the month  this machine replaces a much smaller cocoon processing machine the company has been using to produce materials under a contract with the us army  the increased capacity and efficiency this new equipment offers will free up production staff and lower overall costs  over the next month the company plans to supply the army with sample single filament dragon silk fibers for independent testing and to have the first batch of finished dragon silk thread ready for knitting into ballistic shootpacks  the company anticipates completing the additional silk necessary for producing the woven shootpacks for the us army in the third quarter  this newly installed equipment is expected to play an important role in meeting this new timeline  “in many cases up until now we’ve been working with research scale equipment as we transitioned out of the laboratory” said coo jon rice  “we had originally hoped to have completed all silk production for the first army contact by now  that timeline in consultation with our customer has been extended due to challenges that a third party vendor had in scheduling and processing as well as the throughput limitations of our production facility in its first month of operations  this new equipment can process more cocoons in one hour than we currently process in a month and it is expected to play an important role in meeting the new timeline  this new commercial scale machine is expected to sustain our domestic production capacity through  and reduce labor costs significantly” in addition to its planned expansion of domestic production the company as earlier

labs website content of these articles have not been written by kraig labs httpdsfhkjcom cancel continue spider silk  kraig biocraft laboratories technology spider silk introduction to spider silk the product it has long been known that certain fibers produced in nature possess remarkable mechanical properties in terms of strength resilience and flexibility these protein based fibers exemplified by spider silk have been the subject of much interest due to spider silk’s incredible toughness because of its strength resilience and flexibility spider silk holds great promise for commercial and consumer applications while the superior properties of spider silks are well known there was no known way to produce spider silk in commercial quantities since spiders are cannibalistic they cannot be raised in concentrated colonies to produce silk the production of spider silk in commercial quantities holds the potential of a lifesaving ballistic resistant material which is lighter thinner more flexible and tougher than steel other applications of spider silk include use as structural material and for any application in which light weight and high strength are required kraig biocraft laboratories’ believes that in the near future genetically engineered spider silk will make significant inroads into the market for highstrength fibers spider silk technology while scientists have been able to replicate the proteins that are the building blocks of spider silk two technological barriers have until now stymied production these barriers are the inability to form these proteins into a spider silk fiber with the desired mechanical characteristics and to do this cost effectively to solve these problems kraig invented a new technology and acquired the exclusive right to use the patented genetic sequences for numerous fundamental spider silk proteins we have placed ourselves in an advanced position by working collaboratively with the leading universities which developed some of the most relevant genetic engineering technologies in fact most of our genetic engineering work takes place inside university laboratories kraig is the world leader in genetically engineered spider silk technologies we earned that place by applying our proprietary genetic engineering spider silk technology to an organism which is already one of the most efficient commercial producers of silk the domesticated silkworm kraig’s spider silk technology builds upon the unique advantages of the domesticated silkworm for this application the silkworm is ideally suited to produce genetically engineered spider silk because it is already an efficient commercial and industrial producer of silk forty percent  of the caterpillars’ weight is devoted to the silk glands the silk glands produce large volumes of protein called fibroin which are then spun into a composite protein thread silk  we have used genetic engineering technology to create spider silk a part of kraig’s intellectual property portfolio is the exclusive right to use the patented spider silk gene sequences in silkworm spider silk strength stronger than steel kraig envisions genetically engineered spider silk with its superior mechanical characteristics will surpass the current generation of highperformance fiber we believe that spider silk is in some ways so superior to the materials currently available in the marketplace that an expansion of demand and market opportunities will follow spider silk’s commercial introduction for example the ability of natural spider silk to absorb in excess of  joules of kinetic energy makes it a potentially ideal material for structural blast protection the table below illustrates spider silk’s incredible toughness and strength to weight ratios comparison of the properties of natural spider silk kevlar® and steel material toughness  tensile strength  weight  dragline spider silk    kevlar®    steel    the market for spider silk kraig is focused on the creation production and marketing of high performance and technical fibers such as spider silk because spider silks are stronger and tougher than steel they could be used in a wide variety of military industrial and consumer applications ranging from ballistic protection to superior strength and toughness the global market demand for technical fibers is growing rapidly and these materials have become essential products for both industrial and consumer applications by  the annual global market for technical fibers had already reached approximately  billion we believe that the superior mechanical characteristics of the next generation of spider silk will open up new applications for the technology and result in a significant increase in demand the materials which we are working to produce are stronger than steel spider silks can justifiably be referred to as “super fibers” genetically engineered spider silk and synthetic spider silk kraig has created approximately twenty different genetically engineered spider silk fibers based on our genetic designs a scientific article fully describing one of the first of these remarkable spider silk fibers and our methodology for creating it has been peer reviewed and published in the prestigious science journal pnas the journal of the national academy of sciences we use the term genetically engineered spider silk instead of synthetic spider silk because these materials are not synthetic they are made by genetically engineered silkworms and the fiber is composed entirely of protein produced naturally by the silkworm they are synthetic spider silks only in the sense that they are not being produced by a spider but by a much more efficient organism kraig’s lead product is a genetically engineered spider silk known as dragon silk™ its closely related sister product monster silk® both dragon silk™ and monster silk® are spun by lines of our transgenic silkworms they are composed of a unique combination of spider silk protein and silkworm silk protein these genetically engineered spider silks are significantly stronger and more flexible than commercial grade silk we believe that this product will make significant inroads into both technical textile and mundane silk and apparel markets the traditional silk market is estimated at approximately  to  billion us per year at the raw fiber level given its superior physical properties monster silk™ particularly is well positioned to penetrate that market dragon silk™ represents a massive leap forward in the company’s recombinant spider silk technology combining both the elasticity and strength elements of native spider silk we expect applications for form of spider silk and its derivative products to have uses in both the technical and protective textile markets kraig is in the process of ramping up commercial production of its genetically engineered spider silks including monster silk™ and dragon silk™ kraig is also in the advanced development stage for its nextgeneration spider silk product tentatively known as spiderpillar™ spiderpillar™ will be an essentially pure spider silk this material holds the potential to make significant inroads into the technical textiles market our third line of products which we refer to as “gen  technical and medical fiber” is designed to move beyond the physical mechanical and chemical properties of natural spider silk gen  fibers are in a relatively early stage of development and will incorporate such elements as antibacterial agents for medical use and metallic ions for use in industrial processes more

proteins and fibers and materials teams of other scientist around the world have worked on other ways to produce spider silk including using genetically engineered ecoli bacteria that work is scientifically sound but with production costs that could exceed  per kilogram it is difficult to see how these programs could capture a significant part of the textile market kraig is able to produce

and development    compare technologies kraig biocraft laboratories inc trading symbol kblb is applying its proprietary genetic engineering technology to find solutions in the areas of material science we are developing  genetically engineered spider silk which we believe will have broad applications for the multibillion dollar textile industry and in the market place for highstrength materials our investments in spider silk related genetic research are focused on product development and innovative nearterm solutions to the practical problems of our world these investments have resulted in our widely heralded success in developing recombinant spider silks and the first ever technology for commercial production of the same life science and spider silk technology spider silk is among the strongest fibers produced in nature some spider species are capable of producing up to seven different types of silk depending upon the spider’s particular need at that time for example a spider will use one type of silk to make the structural supports for its web and another type to wrap its captured pray drag line silk the silk used when a spider is rappelling is of particular commercial interest spider silk a natural polymer is both extremely strong and extremely flexible these properties of the underlying polymer create the potential for exciting commercial opportunities applications of spider silk and highperformance fibers spider silk holds the potential of a lifesaving ballistic resistant material lighter thinner flexible and tougher than steel material these mechanical properties are similar and yet exceed that of many of the high performance technical fibers that are currently on the market today  high performance technical fibers are currently used in a wide variety of military industrial and consumer applications requiring superior strength toughness and flexibility on this point in  kraig labs signed a contract with the us army for the development and delivery of ballistic shoot packs the challenge production of genetically engineered spider silk hailed as one of nature’s most remarkable materials spider silk is made when spiders spin liquid protein into solid fibers while the superior properties of spider silks were well known there was no known way to produce the fibers in commercial quantity the spiders are cannibalistic and cannot be raised in concentrated colonies until now this technological barrier has stymied spider silk production our solution production of genetically engineered spider silk at its inception kraig labs obtained proprietary genetic engineering technology to unlock the mystery of producing spider silk it was in early  that the company obtained certain exclusive rights from the university of wyoming to utilize the spider silk gene sequences in our field of use this web site previously stated that the company was working to reduce its technology to practice that changed with the public announcement of our success on september   we are currently ramping up production of our monster silk™ and dragon silk™  for commercialization and continuing to develop new and exciting recombinant spider silk fibers monster silk™ is the world’s first economically viable recombinant spider silk for textile use a thin lightweight flexible and high strength fiber  kraig is ramping up commercial scale production of monster silk™ the cleanest commercial alternative to the high strength technical textiles we believe that this product will make significant inroads into both technical textile and mundane silk and apparel markets the traditional silk market is estimated at approximately  to  billion us per year at the raw fiber level given its superior physical properties monster silk™ is well positioned to penetrate that market as well as the larger technical textile market which is estimated at approximately  billion us in  we announced a breakthrough our dragon silk™ line of transgenic silkworms it and its progeny have proven not only to be stronger and more elastic than commercial grade silkworm silk but stronger and more elastic than certain spider dragline silks in  we produced four new distinct transgenic lines which use the most complex genetic designs in the company’s history on top of the new lines the lab also produced a new genetic insertion design for more effective gene splicing this new design incorporated the properties of our dragon silk™ and monster silk™ into a single construction this experiment to merge monster silk’s elasticity focus with the strength focus of dragon silk into a single package was the logical next step for the technology in  kraig labs secured its first material development and delivery contract from the us army under this contract

products artificial spider silk website wwwkraiglabscom kraig biocraft laboratories inc was founded by kim thompson in april  to develop and commercialize spider silks and other high performance polymers using spider silk gene sequences discovered and invented at the university of wyoming by dr randy lewis in combination with genetic engineering strategies developed by dr malcolm fraser university of notre dame and donald jarvis university of wyoming contents  the science  artificial spider silk applications  scientists involved  awards won  references  external links the scienceedit the method used to genetically modify the silkworm uses the piggybac transposon vector discovered and developed by dr fraser at the university of notre dame specific sequences of spider silk dna are inserted into the genetic makeup of the silkworm to create a strain of the insect that now produces the spider protein they are able to customize the sequences that are inserted into the silkworm thus giving the ability to customize the resulting silkworms thread strength and flexibility to ensure the silkworm has been genetically modified a gene was attached that gave the transgenic silkworms red glowing eyes the thread produced by the transgenic silkworms is close to the strength and flexibility of the native spider strength relative to native spider silk is  kraig biocraft laboratories is not the first to create transgenic silkworms incorporating spider silk proteins where kraig labs has succeeded is that the spider silk proteins are integrated structurally into the transgenic silkworm

executives board members kim thompson chairmanpresceocfofounder jonanthan r rice jon chief operating officer show more spider silk  kraig biocraft laboratories technology spider silk introduction to spider silk the product it has long been known that certain fibers produced in nature possess remarkable mechanical properties in terms of strength resilience and flexibility these protein based fibers exemplified by spider silk have been the subject of much interest due to spider silk’s incredible toughness because of its strength resilience and flexibility spider silk holds great promise for commercial and consumer applications while the superior properties of spider silks are well known there was no known way to produce spider silk in commercial quantities since spiders are cannibalistic they cannot be raised in concentrated colonies to produce silk the production of spider silk in commercial quantities holds the potential of a lifesaving ballistic resistant material which is lighter thinner more flexible and tougher than steel other applications of spider silk include use as structural material and for any application in which light weight and high strength are required kraig biocraft laboratories’ believes that in the near future genetically engineered spider silk will make significant inroads into the market for highstrength fibers spider silk technology while scientists have been able to replicate the proteins that are the building blocks of spider silk two technological barriers have until now stymied production these barriers are the inability to form these proteins into a spider silk fiber with the desired mechanical characteristics and to do this cost effectively to solve these problems kraig invented a new technology and acquired the exclusive right to use the patented genetic sequences for numerous fundamental spider silk proteins we have placed ourselves in an advanced position by working collaboratively with the leading universities which developed some of the most relevant genetic engineering technologies in fact most of our genetic engineering work takes place inside university laboratories kraig is the world leader in genetically engineered spider silk technologies we earned that place by applying our proprietary genetic engineering spider silk technology to an organism which is already one of the most efficient commercial producers of silk the domesticated silkworm kraig’s spider silk technology builds upon the unique advantages of the domesticated silkworm for this application the silkworm is ideally suited to produce genetically engineered spider silk because it is already an efficient commercial and industrial producer of silk forty percent  of the caterpillars’ weight is devoted to the silk glands the silk glands produce large volumes of protein called fibroin which are then spun into a composite protein thread silk  we have used genetic engineering technology to create spider silk a part of kraig’s intellectual property portfolio is the exclusive right to use the patented spider silk gene sequences in silkworm spider silk strength stronger than steel kraig envisions genetically engineered spider silk with its superior mechanical characteristics will surpass the current generation of highperformance fiber we believe that spider silk is in some ways so superior to the materials currently available in the marketplace that an expansion of demand and market opportunities will follow spider silk’s commercial introduction for example the ability of natural spider silk to absorb in excess of  joules of kinetic energy makes it a potentially ideal material for structural blast protection the table below illustrates spider silk’s incredible toughness and strength to weight ratios comparison of the properties of natural spider silk kevlar® and steel material toughness  tensile strength  weight  dragline spider silk    kevlar®    steel    the market for spider silk kraig is focused on the creation production and marketing of high performance and technical fibers such as spider silk because spider silks are stronger and tougher than steel they could be used in a wide variety of military industrial and consumer applications ranging from ballistic protection to superior strength and toughness the global market demand for technical fibers is growing rapidly and these materials have become essential products for both industrial and consumer applications by  the annual global market for technical fibers had already reached approximately  billion we believe that the superior mechanical characteristics of the next generation of spider silk will open up new applications for the technology and result in a significant increase in demand the materials which we are working to produce are stronger than steel spider silks can justifiably be referred to as “super fibers” genetically engineered spider silk and synthetic spider silk kraig has created approximately twenty different genetically engineered spider silk fibers based on our genetic designs a scientific article fully describing one of the first of these remarkable spider silk fibers and our methodology for creating it has been peer reviewed and published in the prestigious science journal pnas the journal of the national academy of sciences we use the term genetically engineered spider silk instead of synthetic spider silk because these materials are not synthetic they are made by genetically engineered silkworms and the fiber is composed entirely of protein produced naturally by the silkworm they are synthetic spider silks only in the sense that they are not being produced by a spider but by a much more efficient organism kraig’s lead product is a genetically engineered spider silk known as dragon silk™ its closely related sister product monster silk® both dragon silk™ and monster silk® are spun by lines of our transgenic silkworms they are composed of a unique combination of spider silk protein and silkworm silk protein these genetically engineered spider silks are significantly stronger and more flexible than commercial grade silk we believe that this product will make significant inroads into both technical textile and mundane silk and apparel markets the traditional silk market is estimated at approximately  to  billion us per year at the raw fiber level given its superior physical properties monster silk™ particularly is well positioned to penetrate that market dragon silk™ represents a massive leap forward in the company’s recombinant spider silk technology combining both the elasticity and strength elements of native spider silk we expect applications for form of spider silk and its derivative products to have uses in both the technical and protective textile markets kraig is in the process of ramping up commercial production of its genetically engineered spider silks including monster silk™ and dragon silk™ kraig is also in the advanced development stage for its nextgeneration spider silk product tentatively known as spiderpillar™ spiderpillar™ will be an essentially pure spider silk this material holds the potential to make significant inroads into the technical textiles market our third line of products which we refer to as “gen  technical and medical fiber” is designed to move beyond the physical mechanical and chemical properties of natural spider silk gen  fibers are in a relatively early stage of development and will incorporate such elements as antibacterial agents for medical use and metallic ions for use in industrial processes more about kraig biocraft laboratories the leader in genetically engineered spider silk kraig biocraft laboratories inc kblb is a biotechnology company

effective and capable of producing a wide range of proteins and fibers and materials teams of other scientist around the world have worked on other ways to produce spider silk including using genetically engineered ecoli bacteria that work is scientifically sound but with production costs that could exceed  per kilogram it is difficult to see how these programs could capture a significant part of the textile market kraig is able to produce its genetically engineered spider silks including monster silk™ at less than  of that cost in  kraig successfully completed its pilot production program for its spider silk product monster silk™ we are currently ramping up commercial scale production of dragon silk on july   we announced our first us military contract to deliver dragon silk™  kraig labs will deliver spider silkbased ballistic shoot packs for performance testing for soliderrelated protective applications  shortly thereafter we announced that we had taken possession of a new production facility in indiana for the purpose of scaling up production of dragon silk and other spider silk based products kraig continues a collaborative research and development effort with the university of notre dame this has resulted in a number of exciting spider silk technological breakthroughs those breakthroughs include the development of numerous strains of transgenic silkworm which

animals outside of laboratory research commercialisation of these animals has been extremely  limited numerous factors including negative consumer perception regulatory hurdles and limitations inherent to classical gm technologies have kept the majority of gm animal applications within the realm of academic research however genome editing using zinc finger nucleases could help develop new markets for the future commercialisation of gm animals genetic modification is commonplace throughout the life sciences sector from fundamental research to pharmaceutical testing gm cellular and animal models are valuable tools for the study of many chronic diseases the testing of pharmaceutical compounds and the development of new therapeutic strategies genetic modification also offers great benefits in vaccine and biopharmaceutical manufacturing which rely heavily on the use of gm organisms for biomolecule design and production modifying the genome of an organism or cell line allows the incorporation of target biomolecules in specific biological contexts as well as the transfer of a gene product from a lowproducing organism to one that can produce on a commercial scale these applications have been widely accepted for many years with countless gm organisms approved for medical manufacturing applications by drug regulators in all major countries despite this widespread success within the research and pharmaceutical sectors the use of gm organisms outside of these markets has been limited despite the lack of broad acceptance for most commercial applications of gm animal products this technology has been able to gain traction in a few market sectors the most obvious application has been the commercialisation of transgenic animals for the production of biomolecules for therapeutic use cattle sheep and goats have been used for largescale production of antibodies steroids and hormones  most notably insulin  for many years in  gtc biotherapeutics received us fda approval for bioproduction of a recombinant human antithrombin this product  atryn  is extracted from the milk of transgenic goats and is the first approved biopharmaceutical to be produced using genetically engineered animals although this is a significant breakthrough for the commercialisation of gm animals it is still within the pharmaceutical industry and is a natural progression of existing cellbased technologies of potentially greater commercial interest is the extension of genetic engineering outside of this sector into areas such as food production textiles and even companion animals gm crops have been available in many countries since the early s and numerous cash crops  including sugar beet soybean corn and tomatoes  have been modified to improve resistance to disease increase the rate of growth or enhance nutritional value however cultivation of these transgenic crops is generally tightly regulated particularly within the european union and this together with negative public opinion has limited the more widespread development of gm technologies similar to gm crops many of the animals currently under development are intended to confer disease resistance an application particularly suited to the use of zinc finger nuclease zfn technology many diseases can be treated by the targeted deletion or modification of a host gene with zfns these targets can be modified with no footprint of genetic engineering due to the high costs of raising livestock another area of focus in developing commercial gm animals has been increasing the rate of growth or size of animals among the first gm animals likely to be launched is a fast growing salmon from aquabounty the aquadvantage salmon is designed to reach market size in half the time of a wild type salmon reducing costs for fish farmers and limiting the environmental impact of salmon farming by avoiding the need for ocean pens although genetic engineering of animals for food is primarily driven by economic pressures gm technologies have also been used in the companion animals market in this sector genetic modification can be used for practical purposes  such as the creation of hypoallergenic animals or the correction of heritable congenital defects which have arisen though inbreeding  or for purely cosmetic purposes such as glofish the first example of a gm pet glofish are fluorescent zebrafish danio rerio that have had genes encoding naturally fluorescent proteins gfp yfp rfp inserted into their genome developed by a group at the national university of singapore glofish were originally created to develop live detection systems for water pollution they were introduced as pets in the united states in  following over two years of extensive environmental research and consultation in europe however the sale and possession of glofish is prohibited by rigorous legislation concerning the use of gm technologies  by allowing precisely targeted insertion of spider genes and concomitant removal of endogenous silkworm silk genes at the same locus zfn technology offers the potential for development of transgenic silkworms which will produce native spider silk at commercially viable levels perhaps even more interesting from a commercial perspective is the use of gm animals in the manufacture of textiles silkworms  actually the larval form of the silkmoth bombyx mori  have been used for the production of silk for thousands of years with natural silk still produced by the cultivation of silkworms today silkworm cocoons are unwound to create linear silk threads then respun into textiles in much the same way as cotton although the applications of silkworm silk are numerous due to their unique physical and chemical properties there is also widespread interest in the silks of several other insects spider silk in particular offers numerous possibilities within the technical textiles industry due to its incredible tensile strength and elasticity characteristics which have not yet been replicated in synthetic materials like all insect silks spider silk fibres consist of repetitive units of protein crystals separated by less structured protein chains the exact properties and composition of each spider silk vary with its intended function major ampullate or dragline silk for example is relatively hydrophobic with very high tensile strength and toughness as it is used to form the outer rim and spokes of a web in contrast hydrophilic capture spiral silks which form the inner structures of the web are sticky and highly elastic to effectively entrap prey this high degree of variability offers enormous potential for the textiles industry raising the possibility of tailoring the properties of silk to create advanced technical fabrics for applications such as bulletproof vests parachute canopies and automobile airbags biomedical applications including sutures and tendon and ligament repair new fabrics for sportswear and clothing and even microelectronics although the use of spider silks for microsutures has recently been reported more widespread application of spider silk technologies is currently limited by the difficulty in producing silks on a commercially viable scale this is due to the difficulties of rearing spiders in large numbers due to their highly territorial and cannibalistic nature as a result the harvesting of spider silk fibres is extremely time consuming and labour intensive with production of the only known spider silk garment  an  foot by  foot shawl made from golden orb spider silk  taking  people over five years to produce and costing in excess of £  to overcome these limitations and allow future development of spider silk technologies an alternative strategy for spider silk production is required this makes spider silk production an obvious candidate for genetic modification inserting spider silk genes into the genome of other silkmaking insects for bioproduction  for example random insertion of orb spider silk genes into silkworms has allowed production of hybrid spidersilkworm silk using traditional silkworm farming strategies the resulting hybrid silk contains approximately  spider silk and has greater strength and durability than native silkworm silk raising the possibility of using transgenic silkworms to produce pure spider silks though straightforward in principle the exchange of native silkworm genes for spider silk genes alongside more widespread exploitation of genetic engineering has been limited by the inherent restrictions of conventional gm technologies the generalised process of modifying an organism requires several capabilities including an ability to synthesise or clone the sequence of interest if transferring genetic information the capacity to grow and maintain a population of the organism of interest access to the genome of the organism of interest a mechanism to select animals that have received the modification of interest   while many different techniques exist for accomplishing each of these steps most gm technologies offer a compromise between the efficiency of the technique and the ability to accurately and precisely target the locus of interest viral genomic delivery technologies effectively deliver nucleic acids to cells and organisms but fall short on ability to target specific regions of the genome generally only allowing random insertion of genetic material in comparison transposase technologies allow a greater degree of targeting but leave unwanted traces of exogenous dna in their wake other methods involve the introduction of naked dna into the cell which results in insertion into the genome at very low frequencies usually at random limiting this approach to organisms that can be economically cultivated at high densities and screened in large numbers simply put most techniques for genetic manipulation are random inefficient and leave a footprint of foreign dna while this is usually tolerated in basic research it is not acceptable for most commercial applications and has been a major hurdle for gm animal technologies to date the advent of zinc finger nuclease zfn technology represents a significant breakthrough for commercialisation of gm animal products offering precisely targeted efficient genome editing for the first time commercially available through sigma life science under the compozr brand this technique can be used to create permanent and heritable changes to an organism of interest this high degree of variability offers enormous potential for the textiles industry raising the possibility of tailoring the properties of silk to create advanced technical fabrics credit nir nussbaum zfns are a class of engineered dna binding proteins that facilitate targeted editing of the genome by creating doublestrand breaks at userspecified locations these breaks stimulate the cells natural dna repair mechanisms  homologous recombination hr and nonhomologous end joining nhej  which can be exploited to achieve rapid and permanent sitespecific modification of the desired genes while hr can be used to insert foreign dna sequences nhej allows the cells natural processes to create precisely targeted mimics of natural mutations which leave no traces of foreign dna unlike previous techniques zfns offer excellent sequence specificity binding  to  base pair target sequences to virtually eliminate off target effects and are able to achieve modification rates exceeding   well above rates for most other technologies the technique is already being used to create transgenic silkworms for spider silk production by allowing precisely targeted insertion of spider genes and concomitant removal of endogenous silkworm silk genes at the same locus zfn technology offers the potential for development of transgenic silkworms which will produce native spider silk at commercially viable levels gm technologies have revolutionised the research world and have great potential in a variety of commercial applications but have been limited by the inherent restrictions associated with historical gm technologies the main drawback of these technologies is their inability to accurately and efficiently target genes of interest instead relying on random insertion of genetic material into host genomes these limitations result in the need for extensive and costly screening to identify animals with correct transgene expression without compromising the viability of the animal and also result in the coexpression of both the transgene and native homologues already present the advent of zfn technology signifies the beginning of an exciting new chapter in the world of genetic modification allowing precise targeted and efficient genome editing for the first time production of native spider silk using transgenic silkworms is just one example of the potential commercial applications of this innovative technology taking us one step

announces peer reviewed publication of spider silk and transgenic silkworm breakthroughs  scientific study of the creation of fusion fibers and transgenic silkworm is published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences south bend in  marketwire  jan    kraig biocraft laboratories inc otcqb kblb pinksheets kblb is very happy to start the new year by announcing that the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences published a peer reviewed scientific article describing the breakthrough creation of a spider silk fusion fiber which was achieved by university scientists within the university of wyoming and the university of notre dame who are working cooperatively with kraig biocraft laboratories the article is the first peerreviewed scientific publication describing the creation of transgenic silkworms which have been specifically designed to spin a spidersilkworm silk fusion fiber  the articles abstract states these composite fibers were on average tougher than the parental silkworm silk fibers and as tough as native dragline spider silk fibers  these results demonstrate that silkworms can be engineered to manufacture composite silk fibers containing stably integrated spider silk protein sequences which significantly improve the overall mechanical properties of the parental  silkworm fibers  the fact that a publication as prestigious as proceedings of the national academy of sciences has chosen to publish these results speaks for itself as to the significance to the scientific breakthrough said company founder and ceo kim k thompson   when i founded kraig many people in both business and scientific community said that what we were setting out to do was impossible by maintaining a focused vision and by recruiting the very best minds in molecular biology we have made the impossible a tangible reality congratulations to the scientific team as well as to the university of notre dame and the university of wyoming  they deserve the accolades they are receiving with this publicationcontinued thompson  our next steps are to commercialize these developments while accelerating our development of even more advanced products  the commercial license agreement we signed in the fourth quarter of  was an essential element of the former  as we move toward commercialization of these fibers we are simultaneously moving into an advanced stage in the development of new second generation spider silk polymers the scientific article described above is published online before print january  by the scientific journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences titled  silkworms transformed with chimeric silkwormspider silk genes spin composite silk fibers with improved mechanical properties the recent publication of the analysis of genetically engineered silkworms to produce chimeric spider silks with properties of increased strength and flexibility in the prestigious journal proceedings of the national academy of science represents a significant vindication of our methodology for genetically engineering and producing commercial quantities of novel protiens for medical structural and textile fabrics said dr malcom fraser  if it were not for kraig biocraft laboratories initiating this project and bringing the technologies together these results may never have materialized the work is the culmination of a research effort begun more than  years ago with an internal award from the university of notre dame to my lab to develop silkworm transgenics capabilities a two year nih r grant awarded to dr jarvis lewis and myself and several years of supplemental funding from kraig biocraft laboratoriesfraser continued  the success of this research would have been impossible without the ability to carry out silkworm transgenics mastered by bonghee sohn and youngsoo kim in the fraser lab at the university of notre dame  this manuscript was published after an in depth peer review process and was deemed by the publishers as a newsworthy article of the issue in which it appears further indicating its relative importance to science and technology about kraig biocraft laboratories

kraig biocraft laboratories website aug   source httpwwwkraiglabscompressreleasesletterhtm   kim thompsons letter to shareholders   august   dear fellow kraig biocraft laboratories shareholders i am writing to update you on the significant progress the company has made in executing its business plan in  and to share with you our vision of the road ahead the company has achieved a number of milestones in late  and during the first two quarters of  starting with the publication of our work on the creation of spider silk based polymers by the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that was closely followedup by textile world the prestigious industry publication featuring our spider silk based polymer monster silk™ as its technical textile of the month the aforementioned publications as well as many other articles were important catalysts that focused the spotlight on our work following which a number of companies approached us wanting to know if our spider silk based fibers would work in their existing product lines or to explore the possibility of using our monster silk™ to enter into new markets as discussions with these companies about the potential opportunities progressed we decided that the best approach to commercializing our monster silk™ would be to work cooperatively and collaboratively possibly on an exclusive basis with one or two companies with existing market share in our target markets we currently define those target markets as military police and dhs related applications sportswear other industrial and consumer applications clothing and fashion wear and finally existing silk product markets initially our strategy was geared toward identifying potential monster silk™ commercialization partners and weve been in discussions with a number of interested companies about incorporating monster silk™ into their products we then exhibited to the technical textile industry at the techtextil trade show in late april where monster silk™ sparked tremendous interest at the show even though the exhibition exceeded our expectations in terms of the generation of interest and numerous contacts with new potential commercialization partners which resulted in ongoing negotiations some may have interpreted the lack of public comment by the company as an indication that we stopped moving our business plan forward nothing could be further from the truth as we are actually accelerating on all fronts the nature of the negotiations weve entered into require extreme discretion due to nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements while we cannot comment about specific discussions i can state my personal belief which is that the first commercial monster silk™ agreements will be with military and sportswear producers i believe that we are currently on track to enter into memorandums of understanding and letters of intent in the near term although we continue to receive additional inquiries and were even in the midst of the negotiating another nondisclosure agreement as i write this letter we are likely to select one or two defense contractors or companies that supply defense contractors and one or two sportswear companies to receive some degree of partial exclusivity for the commercial development of monster silk™ in their respective markets we have a onceinalifetime technology we have taken the first two quarters of  to lay the foundation of our commercialization strategy to ensure that the commercialization agreements we enter into maximize longterm shareholder value some of the companies that weve been talking with include household names and wellknown brands the current negotiations approach is not unlike our bold move to secure the use of zinc finger nuclease zfn technology although the zfn technology negotiations with sigmaaldrich took time they yielded impressive results because of these actions and others like it kraig biocraft laboratories was able to accelerate research and development and is now positioned for greater success as those of you who closely follow the company know we have been working with sigma aldrichs zfn technology to increase the power of our own technology in the first half of this year we experimented with the combination of our technology with zfn the zfn has proven to be so powerful that it requires an adjustment in our genetic packets our analysis of the data has given us increased confidence that we are on the right track for the development of fibers that are even more advanced than monster silk™ while that work is continuing we are also in the later stages of producing more exciting new genetic configurations for use in combination with zfn until recently all of the companys laboratory work took place entirely within university laboratories pursuant to collaborative research agreements which we renewed with the university of notre dame even though we increased our financing of the collaborative research project and we are now accelerating our research at notre dame in the second quarter we signed a lease for a laboratory near the university that was a big step forward in our growth and indicates our commitment to accelerate the development of new spider silk based fibers because we believe that we are closer to the development of our pure spider silk platform our new private laboratory at innovation park a state of the art facility near notre dame is equipped with top of the line security including biosensors which we feel is more appropriate for our technology at its current state of development kraig biocraft laboratories has made great strides and achieved several milestones in the first two and a half quarters of  plus we laid down a very solid foundation for both our commercialization program and for advanced rd laying down that foundation has been grueling work but now that the foundation is in place the next stages of development should be more exciting and tangible our plan is to continue to build on our research knowledge to develop more advanced polymers in the near term on the monster silk™ commercialization front we are currently in privileged discussions with potential commercialization partners including some medium sized and larger companies we anticipate that those discussions will bear fruit in the near term in short i am determined to unlock the maximum value for our shareholders we are delighted with the current positioning of our commercialization opportunities which were building on the foundation we laid out in the first half of the year in order to seize those opportunities i know that this comprehensive approach takes more time but im convinced that we control our own destiny and this will enable us to create far more longterm shareholder value thank you for supporting the company and taking the time to read this letter i am very proud of our innovative company and the ingenious technology weve developed but i am

creation of new recombinant spider silks the new spider silks which have an unusual red cast and were designed for superior strength are collectively designated by the company as big red lansing mich jan   globe newswire  kraig biocraft laboratories inc otcqbkblb the company or kraig announced that researchers working pursuant to kraigs collaborative research program utilizing customized spider silk genetic engineering sequences succeeded in creating a new type of recombinant spider silk which the company is designating as big red the big red silk is currently being spun within the laboratory by transgenicly modified silkworms big red is a composite fiber said company ceo kim thompson this new type of fiber was designed to be a combination of spider silk proteins silkworm silk proteins and protein from an unrelated species from a genetic perspective what significantly differentiates this material from our monster silk™ is the unique spider silk genetic sequence that we used which we designed to increase strength to weight ratios another important difference is the incorporation of a unique protein which gives the new fiber its designation as red  the design for big red derived from what we learned about the mechanical characteristics of recombinant spider silk fibers from our work with monster silk™ continued thompson specifically the new fiber was designed to place more emphasis on tensile strength and slightly less emphasis on elongation we anticipate that big red will be a powerful arrow in our quiver as we move to commercialize monster silk™ and the company is hopeful that this new material will follow it in the commercialization pipeline in my view the creation of big red demonstrates the power of our technology to continue to develop new and exciting materials the big red name comes in part from the fact that the fibers have a slight red cast under uv light the new fibers actually glow bright red thompson further stated the successful creation of these new materials once again validates our scientific models based upon the observed levels of color expression and the nature of the spider silk genetic configurations used in its creation the hope is that it will find its own significant niche in the technical textiles marketplace preparation for mechanical testing of the new fiber is currently taking place about kraig biocraft laboratories inc

monster silktm production at quantities necessary for producing textile prototypes company to increase scale of its recombinant spider silk production  lansing mich aug   globe newswire  kraig biocraft laboratories inc otcqbkblb company the leading developer of advanced spider silk based fibers today announced that the companys pilot production program has successfully produced a sufficient quantity of monster silk™ cocoons to allow the company to make the first monster silk™ textile prototypes the cocoons still need to be reeled and processed into yarn before the first prototype and sample textiles can be produced the announcement puts the company firmly ahead of its most recent textile production schedule the first textiles are slated for mechanical testing of the properties of recombinant spider silk in various textile knits andor weaves the company also announced today a change in its production schedule and scale of operations for its initial commercial production program the timing of cocoon production from the pilot program worked out well because we were getting indications from the field that the weather developing in august was not ideal for the mulberry production needed for our commercial launch said company founder and ceo kim k thompson we are going to take advantage of the fact that with this supply of cocoons we have bought ourselves some breathing room the company plans to delay the launch of commercial production until sometime in september we can now do this with no expected impact on our schedule to produce new textiles by moving the production launch to september we may also be in a position to increase the scale of the initial commercial production by a factor of two or more the laboratory is taking full advantage of the time by working on egg production in order to increase the scale of the commercial launch the pilot production program was the first time that we raised monster silk™ silkworms in real world conditions continued thompson the success of that program has enabled us to prepare for the creation of recombinant spider silk textiles and to increase the scale of our pending launch of spider silk

capacity the companys strategy is to commit the vast majority of its initial production capacity to a propagation program designed to increase its production population a smaller portion of the first commercial production generation should also yield fibers which can be dedicated to the production of woven textile samples our launch of our commercial scale production of monster silk™ is a long awaited major milestone for kraig as we demonstrate our ability to convert recombinant spider silk and monster silk™ most specifically from an exciting laboratory technology to a marketable product said ceo and founder kim k thompson we believe that rolling out the worlds first recombinant spider silk commercial production project will only expand our global development prospects for monster

scaling up of the commercial scale production i want to thank our investors and most particularly the research scientists whose work and dedication has made this long anticipated day possible given the current planned production schedule we could theoretically be producing monster silk™ in metric ton quantities by early january a more conservative estimate given the realities of launching such a

spider silk based fibers announced today that its genetically engineered spider silk monster silk™ production program has more than doubled in productivity during the pilot production program the yield rate of viable silk cocoons was approximately  at those rates the cost structure warranted the conversion of the pilot test program to a much larger scale the latest reports from the current production ramp up point to a dramatic and unexpected increase in yield to  more than double the output efficiency shown during the pilot phase the initial assessment from the companys scientific team is that the monster silkworms™ are acclimating to the production environment this dramatic boost in productivity was a surprise to us our plan was to methodically increase productivity rates over the next  months our team had drawn up plans that included selective breeding and cross breeding to achieve those goals to see such a remarkable gain in so short a time was beyond our expectations the obvious benefits should these rates continue would include reduced production costs and reduced ramp up time said company founder and ceo kim k thompson with this doubling in efficiency we need to focus on emplacing the necessary infrastructure to support the increased productivity as far as challenges go these are good problems to have   we have already taken action to beef up our production

companys genetically engineered spider silk monster silk™ production program is thriving and is successfully accommodating a recent significant increase in the scale of production the company previously reported that its pilot production programs viable silk cocoon yield rate was at approximately  in late  by march after launching the commercial production ramp up program the yields increased to approximately  more than double the output efficiency from the pilot phase   the latest report is that with the increased scale of operations in may the high yields appear to be holding and possibly improving even further the company believes that the high yield is a result of a combination of improved production procedures and adaptability the company is ordering a further doubling of production in june we always believed that our scientific model would translate very well into real world environments but to actually see our silkworms perform at this level is inspiring the technology is now outperforming the infrastructural capacities which bodes well for future product and production expansion said company founder and ceo kim k thompson  the fact that the reported yield rates are holding or improving has given us the confidence to authorize a doubling of the scale of production we anticipate this next larger production run will launch in june we are excited and

considered to be the first of many textiles that are to be created as part of the companys joint development agreement with warwick we have been working with various types of monster silk™ stated charles howland president of warwick we find that all of these fibers are compatible with existing yarn processing and textile formation methods as is expected fiber consistency is not yet at fill production levels however for the current stage of maturity these silk materials already have good levels of quality and consistency we have been making jersey knit samples and will start weaving shortly these small scale trials are key to helping identify for kraig labs areas for development for upcoming fiber production trials we are reviewing textile properties of the samples with kraig staff and exploring the most attractive applications for this fiber overall the trails are well underway and we are making good progress toward commercialization    one of the biggest issues facing our company was creating our first textile and the open question of whether genetically engineered spider silk could be successfully processed using existing textile formation methods said company founder and ceo kim k thompson with this successful test and the creation of the first monster silk™ knits we have established that our genetically engineered spider silk works well with existing

our growth plans for kraig labs over and above notifying you of our pending move we would also like to take a moment to provide some additional information on the status of our research and material development efforts big red big red continues as one of our primary recombinant spider silk gene lines similar to our recently announced dragon silktm line big red is specifically designed to have a tensile strength significantly higher than conventional silk designed specifically for increased strength with lower elasticity the big red silk line we’ve created remains the ideal material for applications where excessive elasticity would decrease overall performance as we expand our research and rearing operation we expect that big red will be a significant element of that effort laboratory lease in  we began renting additional laboratory space at the innovation park in south bend indiana this space was initially intended to provide a secondary location and overflow capacity for the work conducted in the laboratory at notre dame our research center the decision to end the long running lease for this second lab was made after review and determining that we could expand our core research by focusing more of our attention into the notre dame lab by redirecting those resources we are increasing the number of microinjection and incorporate additional gene splicing technologies to further advance our market leading recombinant silk technology the increased scope and funding level for our collaborative research project signed in march of this year points to that refocus this initiative helped to promote our research efforts in developing new plasmids new rounds of microinjections and incorporating new gene splicing techniques warwick mill through our

billion dollar spider idea monster silktm knitted textile magnified x under green filter scientists touted spider silk as the strongest material on earth for many years many claim that it’s stronger than steel and laud it as the “holy grail” of fibers but there was no way to reproduce the spider’s web for mass consumption until kraig labs hit the scene in  kim thompson began working on a recombinant spider silk platform concept and in  he engaged dr malcom fraser to create a transgenic silkworm which was followed by collaboration agreements with the university of wyoming and notre dame kraig labs is formed in  and begins trading under the symbol kblb by  thompson and fraser announced in a joint press conference held at notre dame that their transgenic sequencing worked and his silkworms were in fact spinning recombinant spider silk kblb discovered how to cost effectively mass produce the “holy grail” of fibers and put everyone on notice that socially responsible spider silk would soon become a reality us biologists may have oneupped spiderman genetically modifying silkworms to produce spider silk with properties similar to natural spider web a stunning achievement with vast potential medical and textile use afp symbol kblb   kraig biocraft laboratories inc you can buy kblb at any of these brokers scientists touted spider silk as the strongest material on earth for many years many claim that it’s stronger than steel and laud it as the “holy grail” of fibers kraig’s transgenic silkworms a little more about kraig labs kblb signed agreement with nasdaq sigma aldridge to utilize their zinc finger technology national academy of sciences publishes a peer review of kblb’s transgenic silkworms and spider silk monster silk earns textile world’s technical fiber of the month award kblb introduces big red fiber monster silk pilot production program successfully confirms scalability warrick mills and kblb sign collaborative agreement to develop weaves and technical blends using kraig’s fibers kim thompson meets with the vietnamese vicepremier to organize a large scale production facility kraig develops dragon silk which is reported to be  stronger than natural spider silk kblb signs mou with the vietnamese government  new strands of spider silk are developed and sent for testing kblb plans limited domestic production for fiber sales and testing   competitor matrix the “great spider silk arms race” monster silktm knitted textile magnified x under green filter yes… some people didn’t get the memo  over the last couple years while kblb’s been quietly perfecting and planning its commercialization program other companies have entered the spider silk market when you have the “holy grail” of fiber technology and billions of dollars are at stake you have to always expect some competing ideas kblb isn’t just the leader because they were first since kraig’s announcement in  multiple companies has raised hundreds of millions of dollars trying to compete with kraig labs kblb amsilk spiber and bolt threads utilized the hype that kraig created to raise large sums of money in hopes that their products can compete with kblb before i get into the details of what this report means i want to remind you what it takes to have a successful business you must have a market for the product you must be able to produce it for a profit and you must be able to produce it in an environmentally responsible manner very simplistic but sans all of these core values a business will soon shut down cost is typically the main factor in any business after all in order for a company to exist its products must make money amazon may be the only company to go against this model but raising  billion dollars or some crazy amount allowed them to take a beating while eating up market share  none in this space is close to raising that kind of money yet so…… kraig labs to date raised around million usd and has a valuation of around  million usd give or take depending on the trading day bolt raised million usd privately giving it a valuation of around million spiber sold  for million usd valuing it around million usd and amsilk which published limited funding information but as you can see in the report its valuation is about milion usd from an opportunity standpoint it’s easy to see that kblb has the edge here as the stock is cheap compared to any of its competitors especially since bolt amsilk and spiber will most likely need to raise more capital and have no exit strategy for investors based on these numbers kblb should be priced at around  cents today monster silktm knitted textile it’s currently sitting below a nickel and it’s the only spider silk company that you can invest in unless you’re a wealthy banker type the riskreward category goes to kblb as there is significant upside for investors who buy or get in this biotechnology stock now in fact misread biotechs can offer the best risk reward scenarios because the market eventually figures out the company’s prospects think about how celator pharmaceuticals nasdaq cpxx was similarly oversold to the point that just a few weeks ago you could have picked up shares for just over a buck but then the cpxx published favorable study data followed by jazz’ nasdaq jazz b buyout offer a cool share and just like that another biotech grand slam so consider that kblb completed enough rd to start production they’re already producing sample fibers for potential customers and collaborative partners but they’re going to increase production and with that the sales are sure to follow spiber bolt and amsilk are still working on their production process monster silktm knitted textile all three of these companies’ synthetic spider silk fibers require some type of fermentation which unlike beer also involves multiple production steps and some use of hazardous chemicals for finalizing the product the best current estimates from the protein production industry indicate that a  liter batch of gmo yeast or bacteria used to excrete recombinant protein could cost anywhere from  to  to produce and manage at a high protein yield of  grams of usable silk protein per liter of solution this could cost anywhere from  to  per kilogram of silk protein these costs do not even include the cost of other items and processes like silk protein purification and wetspinning the protein globs these additional steps are all required further down the production process before you ever get to usable silk fibers now just to reiterate kblb’s spider silk is all natural created by silkworms so kraig’s method uses a technology that has existed and been proven for thousands of years kraig’s production process is as simple as growing and feeding white mulberry leaves to its proprietary silkworms and harvesting recombinant spider silk directly from the cocoons using this technique economical silk production can be done for significantly less than  per kilogram compared to the reported  to  per kilogram cost for the fermentation approach so kblb beats all of the competition by miles  they will need to develop a new way of fermentation that is way more cost effective just to think about being anywhere near kblb’s production cost structure who can afford to compete with kraig  monster silktm knitted textile what about all the money raised and future monies that will need to be raised when bolt spiber and amsilk burn through their cash trying to produce synthetic spider silk kblb will be producing an allnatural and feasible version of spider silk it will be hard to imagine anyone else competing with them nexia had spider silk goats and they blew almost a hundred million dollars of investors’ money giving the last spider milk goats to the museum all told kblb looks like it will produce the world’s strongest lowest cost only peer reviewed publicly reported recombinant spider silk kraig biocraft laboratories kblb remains the only publicly traded spider silk company on the planet the only company to subject to scientific peer review process and publish that work before the national academy of sciences’ pnas journal plus it’s the only spider silk company to publicly file sec quarterly reports and annually file audited financials as well as the only company to publicly report our material performance specifications now you know why it’s the only company to disclose its production cost structure so if you’ve read all of this and understand what kblb’s technology really means for this market you may agree with me that
