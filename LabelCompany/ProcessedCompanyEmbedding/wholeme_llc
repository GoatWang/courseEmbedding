about our philosophy founded in  wholeme was created by two women dedicated to developing nutrientdense delicious convenient foods like many their lives were busy and chaotic wholeme was created using real ingredients to fuel their active lifestyle a real alternative to the preservativefilled sugarladen snacks that surround us  our story wholeme is the partnership of krista steinbach and mary kosir two smart passionate women who realized the power that food has on their daily lives and want to make eating real delicious food convenient and easy earlier in  we successfully launched a kickstarter campaign and raised over   matt jasper created an amazing video  you can view it  here mary kosir the kosir family thought they were healthy but when mary’s husband was diagnosed with type i diabetes it was time to reevaluate the kosirs kicked it up a notch they embraced a healthier lifestyle entering races together and adopting a grainfree diet it began working wonders – everyone felt better and had more energy throughout the day but mary wanted a snack once in awhile – one that was whole foodbased healthy grainfree and truly tasty after a few red winelaced brainstorming sessions some crazy recipe ideas and late night baking sessions dateme was born krista steinbach you wouldn’t think that one of the founders of a company devoid of grains and white sugar would be a pastry chef in a former life – but at wholeme we like the “wild” things prior to wholeme krista owned and operated a bakeshop and was head pastry chef at a top restaurant in the country while she still appreciates the craft of all she follows a whole foodsbased diet that is constantly evolving after all life is not black and white and is best enjoyed in her opinion finding the balance that is right for you individually krista and mary met lifting heavy weights at crossfit st paul after the debut of dateme from mary’s kitchen it didn’t take long for krista and mary to join forces to bring wholeme to fruition and never look back want to learn more about our products see why were different what are you looking for  search our food previousround nextround iconprinter iconemail iconshare

to the current preservative filled and sugarladen snacks that surround us what were made of healthy fats fats have been given a bad rap in the past but we love fat at wholeme not only is it a dense source of energy to fuel you for hours on end vs its carbohydrate friend—sugar—which will leave you crashing and burning soon after it is also critical to many metabolic processes in the body that regulate hormones and brain function to name a few the fat in our products come from nuts seeds and organic coconut oil these are super healthy fats and our favorite is coconut oil this type of fat can be used immediately by the body for energy without having to be broken down converted and stored like other types of fats we use only real sweeteners you won’t find any “high fructose” ingredients in our products we believe in sweetening with real food – honey dates and vanilla so you can enjoy the added vitamins and minerals from these foods  when combined with healthy fats which slows the absorption of carbs in the bloodstream thus stabilizing blood sugar our sweeteners provide a longer and steadier source of energy no preservatives do you really want to eat that bar that can sit on a shelf for years and taste the same as the day you bought it think about it the only preservative we use is the refrigerator because real food is perishable we believe in ingredients you can pronounce and trust and that’s what you’ll find in all of our products short shelf life long human life right no worries all of our products are grainfree and glutenfree and many of our products are dairyfree and soyfree by creating products without these common allergens wholeme is committed to creating universally healthier foods for a complete list of ingredients in each product visit our shop   ready

foods like many their lives were busy and chaotic wholeme was created using real ingredients to fuel their active lifestyle a real alternative to the preservativefilled sugarladen snacks that surround us  our story wholeme is the partnership of krista steinbach and mary kosir two smart passionate women who realized the power that food has on their daily lives and want to make eating real delicious food convenient and easy earlier in  we successfully launched a kickstarter campaign and raised over   matt jasper created an amazing video  you can view it  here mary kosir the kosir family thought they were healthy but when mary’s husband was diagnosed with type i diabetes it was time to reevaluate the kosirs kicked it up a notch they embraced a healthier lifestyle entering races together and adopting a grainfree diet it began working wonders – everyone felt better and had more energy throughout the day but mary wanted a snack once in awhile – one that was whole foodbased healthy grainfree and truly tasty after a few red winelaced brainstorming sessions some crazy recipe ideas and late night baking sessions dateme was born krista steinbach you wouldn’t think that one of the founders of a company devoid of grains and white sugar would be a pastry chef in a former life – but at wholeme we like the “wild” things prior to wholeme krista owned and operated a bakeshop and was head pastry chef at a top restaurant in the country while she still appreciates the craft of all she follows a whole foodsbased diet that is constantly evolving after all life is not black and white and is best enjoyed in her opinion finding the balance that is right for you individually krista and mary met lifting heavy weights at crossfit st paul after the debut of dateme from mary’s kitchen it didn’t take long for krista and mary to join forces to bring wholeme to fruition and never look back want to learn more about our products see why were different what are you looking for  search search engine
