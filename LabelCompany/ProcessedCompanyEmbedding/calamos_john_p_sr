thank you for joining us on the calamos asset management third quarter  earnings call joining me today’s call is nimish bhatt our chief financial officer also in the room is christian helmetag our corporate controller i will start the presentation with a business update financial highlights and asset flows nimish will provide additional detail with respect to our financial results and i will then conclude the formal part of the presentation and we’ll open the call to questions on slide  we begin with the snapshot of our total assets which were  billion as of september  the charts here show the total asset mix by strategy and by product category as you can see on the left equity represents  lowervolatility equity is  followed by enhanced fixed income at  the next largest allocation is in our alternative strategies at  followed by total return convertible high yield and fixed income by product category  of our total asset mix is in the openended funds followed by  in closedend funds  in our institutional strategies and  in managed accounts on slide  we breakdown the some of the important developments for the quarter total assets increased from  billion to  billion driven by market appreciation offset by slower outflows we experienced net outflows of  million for the quarter versus  billion last quarter flows are moving in the right direction and we are encouraged by this positive trend we also saw positive flows of  million into our alternative strategies we view these strategies as contributors to our growth going forward as investors look to alternatives to invest in instead of bonds our investment performance continues to improve in our growth strategies due to a number of factors including our more optimistic top down view sector repositioning and significant additions to the talent within our investment team we regularly evaluate our products to meet the evolving needs of our clients we launched two new funds this quarter the calamos dividend growth fund and the calamos mid cap growth fund we also reopened our flagship calamos convertible fund and the calamos evolving world growth fund marked its fiveyear anniversary this quarter we enhanced our existing investment team resources including two additional coportfolio managers for fixed income and high yield the company continues its commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet also calamos investments llc repurchased  shares of class a common stock for a total of  million during the first nine months of the year as part of our corporate share repurchase program the repurchase program primarily allows the company to offset the dilution from the share issuance under our incentive comp program on slide  you’ll see further detail regarding our asset flows our total assets increased by  during the quarter driven by  billion in market appreciation primarily from equity and lowervolatility equity strategies that appreciation was partially offset by the  million in outflows as we detailed in the previous slide the company’s funds experienced net outflows of  million compared to  billion from the second quarter while separate accounts had  million in net outflows for the quarter compared to  million from the second quarter the net outflows stem primarily from our us growth strategy lowervolatility equity strategies while net inflows were seen in our alternative strategies this quarter overall the rate of outflows for the quarter has slowed significantly from the previous quarter again we are very pleased to see the positive trends as we focus our attention on investment performance on slide  i’d like to share some of the financial highlights for the quarter nongaap diluted earnings per share was  for the third quarter compared to  in the second quarter and  in the third quarter of  revenues for the period were  million with  million in operating income and an operating margin of  included in the third quarter operating expenses is a onetime employee related charge of approximately  operating margin would have been  for the third quarter excluding this onetime item the decrease in average total assets was primary driver of the decrease in total revenues our margin and our nongaap earnings per share with that i’d like to turn it over to nimish now who will provide greater detail on the financials including our nongaap results nimish nimish s bhatt thank you john on slide  we present gaap and nongaap results which provide additional transparency in evaluating the core operations of our asset management business as john previously mentioned for the third quarter nongaap earnings per share was  compared to  from the second quarter and  from the same period last year the decrease in nongaap earnings per share is attributable to the decrease in management fee revenues as we have experienced a decline in average assets under management during the last year gaap earnings per share was  for the quarter compared to  from the second quarter and  from the same period last year as noted on our second quarter earnings call gaap earnings per share was negatively impacted by two items an increase in tax valuation allowance and a nonoperating charge for otherthantemporary impairment which had combined  per share negative impact on gaap earnings in the second quarter a reconciliation between gaap and nongaap earnings per share is included in the appendix to this presentation slide  provides a graphical presentation of our revenues and operating income total revenues for the third quarter were  million compared to  million from the second quarter and  million from the same quarter year ago management fee revenues were  million for the quarter the decrease in management fee revenues was principally driven by declines in average total assets for the third quarter operating income of  million was down  million from the second quarter due to lower revenues and an increase in operating expenses operating margin of  also decreased due to combination of lower revenues and higher operating expenses we may continue to see pressure on the operating margin as we complete the buildout of our investment team however at the same time we are focused on improving investment performance and flows which we believe will ultimately increase management fee revenue for the company on slide  we show operating expenses presented by expense type compensation expense for the third quarter was  million compared to  million for the second quarter and  million for the same quarter a year ago as john mentioned included in the third quarter compensation expense is a onetime employee related expense of approximately  excluding this item the remaining increase in compensation expense compared to the same quarter a year ago is largely attributable to the costs associated with resource additions we have made to the investment team distribution expenses were lower compared to the previous periods presented mainly due to lower openend fund assets marketing and sales promotion expenses were slightly higher than last quarter mainly due to increased seminar and broker sales expenses however they are slightly lower than the same quarter a year ago ga expenses were lower than the second quarter and the same quarter a year ago as we continue to look for opportunities to reduce overhead expenses primary drivers for the lower ga expenses include lower outsourcing expenses as well as lower legal and other professional fees slide  summarizes the company’s nonoperating activities we recorded net investment income of  million for the third quarter compared to  million in the second quarter and  million from the same quarter last year as noted on last quarter’s earnings call we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of  million or  per share in the second quarter which negatively impacted investment income on slide  you will see our liquid investments consist of cash and investments totaling  million compared to  million of outstanding debt as of september   these balances represent the consolidated strength of our organization we feel these levels of liquidity support our ongoing business operations allows to provide seed capital for new funds provide conservative levels of capital for the company’s regulated subsidiaries fund the company’s share repurchase program and invest in other corporate strategic initiatives slide  shows our dividends payout ratio and yield for the three years and trailing  months the  per share we have paid during last  months represent an  payout ratio on our trailing  months gaap earnings our dividend yield of  is comparable to our peers the company’s dividend policy is an important component to the overall objective of creating longterm shareholder value now i would like to turn it over to john for his concluding remarks john john p calamos sr thank you nimish in summary we are encouraged by the improved investment performance in our growth strategies delivering sustainable outperformance for our client remains the highest priority of the firm we remain focused on investing back into our business and as a result we continue to increase our product breadth to better serve our clients in the third quarter we launched the calamos dividend growth fund and the calamos mid cap growth fund we reopened the calamos convertible fund and our calamos evolving world growth fund marked its fiveyear anniversary also as part of our commitment to our clients in demonstrating our longterm confidence in the firm we continue to add talent and senior resources to our investment team management is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet to support our product expansion and future growth during the first nine months of the year calamos investments repurchased  million shares of class a common stock we are maintaining the regular quarterly dividend of  per share our competitive dividend yields and the recent share repurchase program are examples of our initiative we have undertaken to enhance shareholder value with that i’d like to open it up to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and we will first go to the site of adam beatty with bank of america your line is now open adam q beatty – bank of america merrill lynch thank you and good afternoon first just a question on the net flows and maybe if you could a little bit of color on gross sales and gross redemptions it looks like the flow trend is improving was that the result of sort of fewer redemptions or have the sales increased and anything you could comment on the lowvolatility equity and growth strategies in particular would be great thanks nimish s bhatt as you saw adam on the growth fund obviously we had a significant slowdown in the net outflows there net outflows for the growth fund were about  million and which is significantly less than the prior quarter and same thing with the growth and income fund as well adam q beatty – bank of america merrill lynch any color on gross to net have sales improved nimish s bhatt marginally adam q beatty – bank of america merrill lynch okay all right that’s helpful and then if you could maybe a little bit of commentary on the institutional pipeline how that looks at present and what kind of activity you’re seeing nimish s bhatt well as you know that we do not comment too much on the pipeline itself but the trend itself is extremely positive for us we are pleased with this trend i think going down from  billion in net outflows to  million is definitely a positive improvement for us but more importantly improving performance is our top priority right now and we are – while we are also delivering a broader product mix to our investor needs adam q beatty – bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you and just one more thanks for taking all my questions in terms of the different personnel changes in the quarter you had a couple of additions maybe a couple of subtractions just trying to get a sense around the run rate on that you mentioned completing the buildout of your investment team so it sounds like maybe there’s a little bit more to come what was the timing of the rolling on of the new senior folks in the quarter and also how much more would you look to add there john p calamos sr we’re continuing to look but it’s – right now it’s more around the edges we’ve made some significant contribution this past year but we will continue to look at the building out the investment team going forward but it’s more so around the edges adam q beatty – bank of america merrill lynch got it that’s helpful thanks very much john i appreciate it john p calamos sr thanks adam operator and we will next go to the site of robert lee with kbw your line is now open andrew n donnantuono – keefe bruyette  woods inc hi guys this is actually andrew donnantuono filling in for rob lee thanks for taking my questions firstly it looks like – it looks like the last question sort of addressed what i had planned to ask but just was wondering if you could kind of give us a sense of kind of a time horizon surrounding kind of your elevated comp of late associated with kind of the buildup of the investment team will that be – maybe a bit more lumpy or could we expect to see kind of a similar comp ratio for the next couple of quarters or it’s a little bit difficult to tell thanks john p calamos sr well it’s – andrew as you know it’s a little bit difficult to tell we continue to look but as i mentioned before it’s more of the – more significant hires have been made andrew n donnantuono – keefe bruyette  woods inc yes john p calamos sr so it’s really more around the edges at this point but i don’t have any really perspective on the timing of this going forward andrew n donnantuono – keefe bruyette  woods inc okay thanks and then just to kind of shift gears a little bit to your balance sheet which is kind of looking at your different notes different pieces of debt and it doesn’t look anything is expiring till third quarter of next year i just was wondering if you guys were comfortable with where you stood from a debt perspective john p calamos no i think you have that right i think it’s indiscernible or so nimish s bhatt that is correct about  million of that is coming up due in  third quarter andrew n donnantuono – keefe bruyette  woods inc yes john p calamos yes so that’s correct andrew n donnantuono – keefe bruyette  woods inc okay all right thanks for taking my questions nimish s bhatt okay operator and we will next go to the site of john dunn with sidoti  co your line is now open john j dunn – sidoti  co llc good afternoon it seems like you guys benefited from a change in your – you said the top down approach and the sector repositioning looking forward how active do you think that’s going to be part of the investment success of you guys is that something that you’re going to look at often or john p calamos sr yes we’ve always done both a top down and a bottom up i guess our remarks there is we didn’t get – last year we didn’t get the top down as correct as we would have liked and as we changed the top down view we did see performance improve obviously the – our bottom up work has also improved performance as well so we always attempt to add value both with our top down view as well as our bottom up selection process and we’re seeing both of those have worked well the past quarter or so here john j dunn – sidoti  co llc gotcha and then do you have sort of a view of what – during a typical year what you would view as a good number for new fund launches i mean you had two this quarter but just looking forward john p calamos sr we are looking as nimish mentioned increasing our product breadth we did file an active etf which we will hopefully launch sometime next year and within the capability of our investment team here we do have an emerging – a evolving world fund which really reflects the emerging market but it’s a lowvolatility fund and we are launching an emerging market equity fund so we have filed for that john j dunn – sidoti  co llc thank you much appreciated john p calamos sr okay thanks john operator operator instructions at this time there seem to be no additional questions i’d like to turn the program back over to our presenters john p calamos sr okay well i want to
