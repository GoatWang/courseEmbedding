experiencing the devastation of the dustbowl the growing and processing techniques of lundberg family farms have developed out of the familys experience albert recognized the role shortsighted farming techniques played in the dustbowl he became committed to working in partnership with nature by using ecological farming techniques that care for the soil wildlife air and water albert shared his respect for the land with his four sons who in turn passed their deeprooted beliefs about the land onto their children since  the lundberg family has been faithful to alberts farming philosophy to
