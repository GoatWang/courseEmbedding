managing general partner and operator atlas resources or mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resource partners lp arp arp  we have drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania and ohio we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy lp atlas energy for administrative services we do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to continue to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling overview the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce primarily natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as · well tending routine maintenance and adjustment · reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and · preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of june   our mgp withheld  of net production revenue for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry results of operations the following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues volumes sales prices production costs and depletion

in natural gas production volumes for the six months ended june   as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well oil revenues we

or its affiliates which are not contractually committed to make loans to us the amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed  of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from thirdparties the partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners historically there has been no need to borrow funds from our mgp to fund operations critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to our asset retirement obligations depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
