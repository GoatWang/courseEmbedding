home   bay capital is an active fiduciary however  we invest the way we want our capital to be managed — with the utmost care in the private equity business we source our own deals by offering strategic inputs for our investees and in the process become trusted advisors  this creates a longterm relationship and often an attractive entry price in investing in public markets we look for companies with moats that are incredibly difficult to breach our typical holding period is quite long – creating overall cost efficiencies  we are motivated by generating performance and our overarching philosophy is to always keep our investors’ interest ahead of our own who we are —   established team with over  years of experience we are shareholders alongside our investors the investment management firm focuses primarily on companies based in india       a boutique investment management firm —     well established operations in india mauritius  singapore —   regulated by sebi india mas singapore and fsc mauritius both longonly and private equity businesses share operational compliance and marketing resources     long track record in private equity —      deals completed on a deal by deal basis recent exits include mcdonald’s india westlife vini cosmetics and sterling holiday resorts   extensive track record in longonly public markets investing in india —         concentrated bottomup longonly approach local network providing quality accuracy and transparency for an information advantage investing in india today reminds me of the us in  doubledigit interest rates beginning to fall a successful central bank fighting inflation and much needed labor reforms being implemented however there is one important difference indias gdpcapita in  is equal to that of the us in ”  james sheridan partner our edge — focused approach — in our longonly efforts we are only interested in great companies that have sustainably high roics in the pe business we invest only in those companies where we believe we can add value to the sponsor while making money for investors local presence — intense research due diligence and logistic support possible experience — we believe we have the experience to assist our companies and the judgment to assess sustainability of returns patience — in our longonly business we believe in an ‘equity yield curve’ where returns increase with time and therefore seek investors who share our belief in the power of compounding   our pe investments are financed on a deal by deal basis we never rush to invest committed capital this patient approach gives us a significant advantage over traditional pe funds private equity investing in india is filled with challenges  bay capital recognises this and has altered its approach  first we never participate in auctions we source our own deals  second we invest only on a deal by deal basis usually after long periods of building trust with sponsors  we therefore feel no pressure to invest based on the cycle of pe fundraising and investing  we believe this discipline ensures a stable reliable investment process and return to our investors”   — siddharth mehta founder       all investments financed ‘deal by deal’ two benefits we are in no rush to invest before the end of ‘an investment period’ and secondly this allows increased transparency for investors     create investment opportunities for ourselves we dont participate in auctions   our goal is to become a longterm trusted advisor by offering strategic input and unique solutions to our investees         willing and able to take management control       several recent profitable exits in a difficult period our private equity strategy — we have found that the best indian listed businesses have turned india’s ‘idiosyncrasies’  of weak logistics and multiple languagescultures into significant barriers to entry our companies have sustainably high returns by capitalizing on branding technology and distribution advantages often built over long periods of time”   — puneet saraogi cofounder  managing partner bay capital partners llp       long only public equities         concentrated approach  stocks         intend to be marketcap agnostic       focus on companies with sustainably high return on capital roce   low turnover positive implications for expense ratio and for longterm taxable investors   our longonly strategy — let us combine ‘look east’ with ‘link west’ and with our global vision we can provide a new platform for our economic structure”    narendra
