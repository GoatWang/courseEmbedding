qa december   view as pdf fund managers charlie chai qa an interview with portfolio manager charlie chai charlie how did the fund perform for the year ending december   the funds share classes gained roughly  trailing the  return of the msci us imi information technology  index and falling just behind the  return of the broader sp ® however the fund outpaced its peer group average considerable market volatility and investors preference for defensive stocks and sectors weighed on the funds relative results in the first six months of the year penalizing my emphasis on growthoriented stocks in seculargrowth industries and secondarily on cyclically sensitive stocks with improving fundamentals in the second half of the year investors grew less defensive and focused more on company fundamentals this riskon attitude helped a number of the funds holdings particularly in the semiconductor space where stock choices and an overweighting jointly made that industry easily our largest contributor positioning in systems software also added value specifically where did the fund run into problems versus the msci sector index stock selection and an overweighting in internet software  services weighed on relative results along with nonbenchmark exposure to internet  direct marketing the first group was home to the funds largest detractor chinabased online advertising provider com this outofbenchmark stock was hurt by selling pressure related to the companys purchase of privately held rival ganjicom as well as the challenges of integrating ganji and other recent acquisitions additionally com issued disappointing revenue guidance in november recently imposed regulations by local chinese governments intended to curb real estate speculation – including higher downpayment requirements – played a part in the firm lowering expectations for propertyrelated advertising on its platform i continued to believe in the longerterm prospects for this stock as i saw it as a potential beneficiary of the growth of chinas middle class one of the broader themes i keep my eye on for riskmanagement purposes i reduced this position somewhat but retained most of it at period end also detracting was an overweighting in electric automaker tesla motors among the funds top holdings at period end after hitting a high for the year in early april the stock consolidated somewhat below that level for the remainder of the period investors remained cautious amid the companys recurring production problems and its decision to purchase solar panel maker solarcity with that said tesla increased production by an impressive  to nearly  vehicles for all of  and i believe the firms rapidly increasing market share could alleviate many of its growing pains finally ill mention untimely ownership of an outofbenchmark position in dena a japanbased provider of online gaming and ecommerce services although the stock rose for the year overall i increased our position here in december shortly before the share price dropped on allegations of inaccurate plagiarized articles on welq its website for health care information i continued to like dena because of the companys joint venture with nintendo to support the latters development of a mobile game platform the first entry for this platform was the highly anticipated super mario run released in middecember other games are already in the pipeline overall the funds holdings of foreign stocks were a drawback this period amid the us dollars strong appreciation in the fourth quarter of  what about contributors a large overweighting in semiconductor maker marvell technology group was the funds largest relative contributor with our position rising  this period the company attracted activist investors and went through a major restructuring process with new management i considerably reduced this position as the stock advanced taking profits along the way overweighting micron technology – a maker of dram nand flash and other kinds of digital memory – also stood out for its positive impact on our relative results i increased this position as the shares fell to a midsingledigit priceearnings pe ratio early in  – well below the broader markets pe ratio based on my expectations for microns earnings in  i thought this was far too pessimistic this turned out to be a good call as the stock enjoyed a sustained rally from midmay through the end of december i reduced this position too given the robust gains it delivered a nonbenchmark stake in japanbased sumco a producer of silicon wafers for semiconductor manufacturers proved timely as well after a cyclical downturn for wafer demand and pricing depressed the stock in the first half of  the supplydemand balance began to normalize in the second half of the year leading to expectations of better pricing for wafer companies i established a stake here in august these developments helped our position post a  return for the period what is your outlook as of period endwhile i expect global technology spending to remain muted in the near term i am optimistic about longerterm trends for the major themes ive identified such as cloud computing software as a service saas big data artificial intelligence and the internet of things over the past decade services internet and software companies have been steadily taking market share from hardware firms the cloud and saas are better value propositions for customers the advantages include smoothing capital expenditures rationalizing hardware costs eliminating the need to manage it infrastructure and keeping clients on the cutting edge of technology more recently we have witnessed the significant development of artificial intelligence and machine learning with applications such as image and voice recognition this development has been driven by the vast amount of data collected in many internetbased applications the material improvement in machinelearning algorithms and the significant reduction in unit computing costs i believe we are in the early to middle innings of this and many other paradigm shifts in the tech sector similar to the mainframe and clientserver eras i believe big shifts in profit pools and market capitalization are possible and my goal is to monitor these changes closely and position the fund to take advantage of them ■ charlie chai on opportunities in international tech companies consistent with my longstanding strategy i continue to look for new ideas in the international markets where many companies are undiscovered or underfollowed by research analysts i believe these markets are a source of compelling growth opportunities for example in the consumer segment internet services and ecommerce companies remain attractive growers especially those that sit at the intersection of the social mobile and local themes in asian markets – especially china south korea and japan – these industries have generally seen a pace of innovation as fast as if not faster than their western peers this pace has been driven by a less intrusive regulatory environment and incumbent companies in certain industries that are much less mature internet finance is another area of rapid growth consumer credit offerings have very low penetration in markets such as china and in southeast asia smartphone adoption has started to resemble growth trends seen in china three years ago i believe considerable longterm value will be created in this region after a period of significant capital inflows weve seen a recent decline in corporate fundraising activity which i believe is very positive for existing internet companies because it means higher barriers to entry and less competition key takeaways the funds share classes gained roughly  for the year ending december   lagging the  return of the msci us imi information technology  index growthoriented stocks in seculargrowth industries favored by portfolio manager charlie chai struggled early in the year amid considerable market volatility and investors preference for defensive stocks and sectors versus the msci sector index stock selection and an overweighting in internet software  services weighed on results along with nonbenchmark exposure to internet  direct marketing conversely stock choices and an overweighting in semiconductors contributed most while positioning in systems software also added value although charlie expects global technology spending to remain muted in the near term hes optimistic about longerterm prospects for the major themes hes identified market recap the sp ® index returned  in  rising sharply on postelection optimism for economic growth the year began during a fairly volatile stretch with stocks hampered by persistent oilprice weakness and usdollar strength markets regained momentum in february amid us job gains a rally in energy and other stimuli that helped keep the roughly sevenyear uptrend intact markets tumbled briefly following the uks june  vote to exit the european union – dubbed brexit – then recovered quickly and settled into a flattish stretch until the november  us presidential election stocks reacted to the outcome by reaching a series of alltime highs for the year energy  led the way amid two strong rallies in commodity prices one in the spring and another in november telecommunication services  was close behind as demand for dividendpaying equities was high early in the period cyclical sectors including financials  industrials  and materials  also posted strong gains conversely consumer staples  and consumer discretionary  lagged the index the latter hurt as online competition continued to pressure brickandmortar retailers real estate  struggled due to expectations for rising interest rates while health care  was hampered by an uncertain political and regulatory outlook performance summary variable annuity contracts are issued by insurance companies through separate accounts that are part of the
