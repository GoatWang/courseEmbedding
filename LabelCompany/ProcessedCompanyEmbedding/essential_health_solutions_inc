is appropriate for everyone our bodies come in all different sizes body types and with different genetic predispositions  what is an appropriate weight for you is not necessarily the appropriate weight for another person  that is why at essential health solutions we approach weight loss from a perspective that takes a persons total health and wellness into account we look for your healthy weight a tall bigboned person with a slow metabolism for example will have a much higher healthy weight than a short wiry person with a fast metabolism  and if the first individual successfully slimmed themselves down to the weight of the second individual they might be thinner but they would by no means be healthier because of this comparing just your weight itself to another persons pound for pound gives us no clear indication of where you fall in relation to your optimal healthy weight instead when assessing your current weight in relation to your optimal healthy weight there are three predominant factors that we take into account percentage body fat waisttohip ratio body mass index these tools allow for a far healthier and useful evaluation an honest and realistic approach to losing weight must be in line with identifying and achieving ones healthy weight not with trying to look like a movie star at each progress visit you have at essential health solutions we will calculate your body fat percentage and bmi to keep track of the progress you make in your weight loss efforts  we will also calculate your waisttohip ratio in order to regularly assess your risk and the potential diagnoses of any weightrelated health concerns lets take a closer look at the factors we take into account while making an assessment of your weight  read more nov  wild vs farm raised fish published in food and drink the quantity of mercury in the ocean and in our fish has become scary and a cause of angst among many health conscious eaters and so farmraised fish are being more

fact nutritional differences between farmraised and wildcaught salmon  in particular wild salmon have a lower fat content at about  by weight and a higher protein content at about  by weight than compared to farmraised salmon which come in at a whopping  fat content by weight  additionally the amount of omega fats are proportionally high in farmraised salmon whereas their omega is low compared to wildcaught salmon  when this occurs the omegas use up specific enzymes contributing to a proinflammatory state  while we need both omega and omega in our diet omega is much harder to obtain from our regular diets and we usually do so by eating cold water fish such as salmon  while on the other hand it is easy for us to get omega as they are relatively abundant in our diet read more dec  healthy eating published in food and drink one of the most significant things you can do while you are planning your menu for the week is to think of nourishment first  meal planning with nourishment

will also need to consider energy as this will fuel your cells for all those reactions when choosing foods for your menu plan it is helpful to keep in mind that foods contain not only carbohydrates proteins or minerals but rather there is typically a mix of many different nutrients in each item  yet since some foods contain a higher amount of an element when compared to a different food they are said to be a good source of that element and gain a reputation for containing it  for example nuts have the reputation of being a good source of fats yet they are also fill the slot as a good source
