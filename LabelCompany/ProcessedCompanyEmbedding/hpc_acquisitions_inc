statements            hpc acquisitions inc notes to financial statements september   and december   unaudited   note a  organization and description of business   hpc acquisitions inc the “company” was initially formed under the laws of the state of minnesota as herky packing co on july   the company initially produced and marketed meat snack foods through food brokers distributors and wagon jobbers despite a  restructuring including the relocation to an approximate  square foot production facility the company’s efforts were unsuccessful and all operations were terminated by the end of  on april   the company changed its corporate name to h p c incorporated in connection with this name change the company acquired ed stein’s tire center inc a minneapolis minnesotabased distributor of gates tires this acquisition was unsuccessful and reversed in    on august   the company changed its state of incorporation from minnesota to nevada by means of a merger with and into hpc acquisitions inc a nevada corporation formed on june   solely for the purpose of effecting the reincorporation the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the nevada corporation are the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation such articles of incorporation modified the company’s capital structure to allow for the issuance of up to  shares of  par value common stock and up to  shares of  par value preferred stock   on march   the company sold  shares of its common stock to david selakovic at a total cash purchase price of  this transaction effected a change in management and control of the company mr selakovic assigned to the company certain assets consisting of the exclusive right to distribute in the western hemisphere natural agrochemicals developed by ecowin co ltd a korean company certain state permits for the sale of ecowin agrochemicals and the trademark “vegalab” the “ds assets” our new plan of operation is to commence the business of selling ecowin products under the brand name “vegalab”   the company is currently in the business of selling the ecowin products under the “vegalab” name in the united states of america the company’s current sole source of supply of ecowin products is through vegalab s a a swiss company solely owned by david selakovic who is also the company’s controlling shareholder chief executive and chief financial officer and a director   note b  preparation of financial statements   the company follows the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and has a fiscal yearend of december    the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud the company’s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure among other items that  recorded transactions are valid  valid transactions are recorded and  transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented   for segment reporting purposes the company operated in only one industry segment during the periods represented in the accompanying financial statements and makes all operating decisions and allocates resources based on the best benefit to the company as a whole   during interim periods the company follows the accounting policies set forth in its annual audited financial statements filed with the u s securities and exchange commission on its annual report on form k for the year ended december              in the opinion of management the accompanying interim financial statements prepared in accordance with the u s securities and exchange commission’s instructions for form q should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the company’s annual report filed with the sec on formk for the year ended december   and are unaudited and contain all material adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective interim periods presented the current period results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results which ultimately will be reported for the full fiscal year ending december     note c  going concern uncertainty   the company’s business plan is to distribute in the western hemisphere certain natural agrochemicals developed by ecowin co ltd a korean company under the brand name “vegalab” however there is no assurance that the company will be able to successfully penetrate its targeted market or that the implementation of said business plan will result in the appreciation of our stockholders’ investment in the then outstanding common stock   the companys continued existence is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support its daily operations as well as provide sufficient resources to retire existing liabilities and obligations on a timely basis the company faces considerable risk in its business plan if insufficient operating capital is available during the next twelve months the company will be forced to rely on existing cash in the bank and additional funds loaned by management andor significant stockholders   the company’s former majority stockholder previously provided the necessary working capital to maintain the corporate status of the company it is the current intent of management and significant stockholders to provide sufficient working capital if necessary to support and preserve the integrity of the corporate entity however no formal commitments or arrangements to advance or loan funds to the company or repay any such advances or loans exist there is no legal obligation for either management or significant stockholders to provide additional future funding   the company anticipates offering future sales of equity securities however there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funding through the sales of additional equity securities or that such funding if available will be obtained on terms favorable to or affordable by the company   the company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock and  shares of common stock the company’s ability to issue preferred stock may limit the company’s ability to obtain debt or equity financing as well as impede potential takeover of the company which takeover may be in the best interest of stockholders the company’s ability to issue these authorized but unissued securities may also negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our debt or equity securities   in such a restricted cash flow scenario the company would be unable to complete its business plan steps and would instead delay all cash intensive activities without necessary cash flow the company may become dormant during the next twelve months or until such time as necessary funds could be raised in the equity securities market   while the company is of the opinion that good faith estimates of the company’s ability to secure additional capital in the future to reach its goals have been made there is no guarantee that the company will receive sufficient funding to sustain operations or implement any future business plan steps   these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business accordingly the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern    note d  summary of significant accounting policies    cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all cash on hand and in banks certificates of deposit and other highlyliquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents             concentrations of credit risk   sales to one customer comprised  of the company’s total revenues and  of accounts receivable for the nine months ended september   the company believes that in the event that its primary customer is unable or unwilling to continue to purchase the company’s goods there are a number of alternative customers at comparable prices    at the present time our sole source of supply is vegalab sa at september   we held inventory at a cost of  and outstanding accounts payable to vegalab sa in the amount of  our payment terms on the account payable are “payable upon sale to consumer”    accounts receivable   in the normal course of business the company extends unsecured credit to virtually all of its customers which are located throughout the united states because of the credit risk involved management has provided an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects its opinion of amounts which will eventually become uncollectible in the event of complete nonperformance the maximum exposure to the company is the recorded amount of trade accounts receivable shown on the balance sheet at the date of nonperformance    inventory   inventory consists of finished goods related to the sale of certain natural agrochemicals developed by ecowin co ltd a korean company under the brand name “vegalab” inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method a charge to income is taken when factors that would result in a need for a reduction in the valuation such as excess or obsolete inventory are noted    revenue recognition   revenue is recognized when the earnings process is completed the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer which is generally the same day as delivery or shipment of the product the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured all sales are recorded when the goods are shipped    the company ships all product on an fobplant “asis” basis accordingly revenue is recognized by the company at the point at which an order is shipped at a fixed price collection is reasonably assured and the company has no remaining performance obligations related to the sale the company sells all products with “no right of return” by the purchaser for any factor other than defects in the products    income taxes   the company files income tax returns in the united states of america and may file as applicable and appropriate various states with few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us federal state and local as applicable income tax examinations by regulatory taxing authorities for years ending before december   the company does not anticipate any examinations of returns filed since january     the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes at september   and december   respectively the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability accounts as recorded when material to the financial statements are entirely the result of temporary differences temporary differences generally represent differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes primarily accumulated depreciation and amortization allowance for doubtful accounts and vacation accruals   the company has adopted the provisions required by the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification the codification topic requires the recognition of potential liabilities as a result of management’s acceptance of potentially uncertain positions for income tax treatment on a “morelikelythannot” probability of an assessment upon examination by a respective taxing authority as a result of the implementation of codification’s income tax topic the company did not incur any liability for unrecognized tax benefits             income loss per share   basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss available to common stockholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the respective period presented in our accompanying financial statements   fully diluted earnings loss per share is computed similar to basic income loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of common stock equivalents primarily outstanding options and warrants   common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of the outstanding stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method at either the beginning of the respective period presented or the date of issuance whichever is later and only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based upon the company’s net income loss position at the calculation date   as of september   and  the company had no outstanding stock warrants options or convertible securities which could be considered as dilutive for purposes of the loss per share calculation    recent accounting pronouncements   in may  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no  revenue from contracts with customers “asu ” which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap the core principle of asu  is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services asu  defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing gaap the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein using either of the following transition methods i a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or ii a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu  recognized at the date of adoption which includes additional footnote disclosures the company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of asu  on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which the company will adopt the standard in    the company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows   note e  fair value of financial instruments   the carrying amount of cash accounts receivable accounts payable and notes payable as applicable approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these items andor the current interest rates payable in relation to current market conditions   interest rate risk is the risk that the company’s earnings are subject to fluctuations in interest rates on either investments or on debt and is fully dependent upon the volatility of these rates the company does not use derivative instruments to moderate its exposure to interest rate risk if any   financial risk is the risk that the company’s earnings are subject to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates and are fully dependent upon the volatility of these rates the company does not use derivative instruments to moderate its exposure to financial risk if any   note f  related party transactions   the company’s current sole source of supply of ecowin products is through vegalab s a a swiss company solely owned by david selakovic who is also the company’s controlling shareholder during the nine months ended september   the company incurred  for product purchases at market rates for resale from vegalab s a and payable upon sale to consumer   as of september   and december   the company had outstanding accounts payable – related party of  and  respectively            note g  notes payable to investors   during  the company borrowed an aggregate  on eight  separate promissory notes payable to six  separate unrelated third parties these notes bear interest at either  or  per annum and were due on the earlier of october   or upon closing by the company of a financing in the amount of  or more these notes were paid in full by march         september      december                              outstanding principal             accrued interest payable                                 total obligation outstanding               note h  note payable to controlling stockholder   the company and its former controlling stockholder craig laughlin agreed in previous periods that additional funds would be necessary to support the corporate entity and comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended to this end mr laughlin agreed to lend the company up to  with an original maturity period not to exceed three  years from the initial funding date at an interest rate of  per annum the maturity date was subsequently extended to september  and postmaturity became due upon demand during the quarter ended march   the company paid this note and all accrued interest in full   on august   the company’s new controlling stockholder david selakovic agreed to lend the company up to  at a rate of  per annum with principal due on sixty days demand as of september   mr selakovic had loaned the company a total  the company accrued interest expense related to this loan of  as of september   no repayments on this note payable were made as of september     note i  common stock transactions   on march   the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock to david selakovic for approximately  in cash the company received  in the fourth quarter of  under a stock subscription and the remaining balance during the nine months ended september     in may  the company completed a private offering of  shares of common stock for  in cash            note j – commitment and contingencies   on july   the company entered into a lease agreement for warehouses located at  business parkway suite  and  minden nevada the facility is  square feet with a lease term of  months at a current cost of approximately  per month the company was also required to make a security deposit of  included in other assets on the balance sheet as of september     note k subsequent events   management has evaluated all other activity of the company through the release date of these financial statements and have concluded that no other subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the accompanying financial statements or disclosure in the notes to financial statements     remainder of this page left blank intentionally            item   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   caution regarding forwardlooking information   the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited december   consolidated financial statements and notes thereto along with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our  annual report on form k filed separately with the securities and exchange commission   this document contains statements that are or may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  all statements other than statements of historical fact which address activities actions goals prospects or new developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future including such things as expansion and growth of our operations and other such matters are forwardlooking statements any one or a combination of factors could materially affect our operations and financial condition these factors include competitive pressures success or failure of marketing programs changes in pricing and availability of products offered to customers legal and regulatory initiatives affecting our products and conditions in the capital markets forwardlooking statements made by us are based on knowledge of our business and the environment in which we operate as of the date of this report because of the factors discussed in our  annual report on form k and factors disclosed in subsequent reports filed with the securities and exchange commission actual results may differ from those in the forwardlooking statements   plan of operation   in march  hpc acquired distribution rights to natural agrochemicals developed by ecowin state permits related to those products a trademark and cash to commence the business of selling vegalab products as described under “item  business” of its annual report on form k for the year ended december   hpc had no customers and no employees at the time of the asset purchase so this endeavor represents the start of a new venture with the assets acquired   we believe the most effective way to establish a foothold in the agriculture industry for our products is to pursue acceptance by one or more of the major united states agricultural businesses this approach is based in part on the resources these businesses have available to test or tryout new product offerings and the resulting “cachet” that can attach to products once they have been accepted by these businesses   to that end our executive officers will pursue discussions with large distributors of fertilizers and pesticides and large farming operations to invite them to perform field tests with sample product preliminary discussions and information provided on the vegalab technology have been wellreceived so hpc expects to focus its efforts initially on pursuing testing programs with the major distributors and producers to advance the opportunity for acceptance and then purchase of the products the last nine months of  will be a period of high activity for testing and promoting the products with the major distributors and producers the large distributors and farming operations is not a large group and we are focused on approximately  of these businesses this targeted approach will enable us to limit the cost of promoting our products during this initial phase of the marketing effort so we believe we have the financial resources to do so without additional capital   to the extent we are successful in converting a major distributor or farming operation to a customer we will need to be able to obtain and deliver product which means we will need to finance inventory we purchased inventory in april  which has been used for testing by prospective customers and sales of “starter” purchases to try the products out in a typical crop setting additional purchases were made in the following months all inventory is purchased from vegalab sa a related party that is owned and controlled by david selakovic an officer director and principal shareholder of the company there is no firm commitment or purchase agreement with vegalab sa at september   we held inventory at a cost of  and outstanding accounts payable to vegalab sa in the amount of  future inventory purchases will depend on how successful we are with our marketing efforts and our ability to finance such purchases            during the fourth quarter of calendar year  we expect to establish an ecommerce presence one of the items we acquired is the us trademark “vegalab™” our marketing efforts will incorporate this brand name our intention is to establish a website around this trademark and build a brand by promoting the efficacy and environmental safety of the vegalab products assuming we have some success with our targeted initial marketing strategy described above we intend to use that to attract other potential users to the products we offer through our website and by employing sales representatives with experience in agriculture to promote our products to other distributors and large scale users   if we are successful in gaining acceptance and orders for our product we expect we will develop two sales channels the first is establishing subdistributors made up of wellestablished distributors of fertilizers and pesticides second is direct sales to farm operations through farm coops and retailers as this is a new venture we cannot predict whether or to what extent we will be successful in establishing and managing these sales channels once we become more established we will actively pursue other marketing and promotional activities such as participation in trade shows and developing plans for expanding marketing outside the unites states   to summarize by the end of the first calendar quarter of  we hope to have   · several major agrichemical product distributors or farming operation established as customers   · a welldeveloped internet presence and brand for our products   · sales representatives promoting our products and   · growing revenue from sales of our products   our plan of operation notwithstanding our business is a new venture with all of the risks and uncertainties associated with such ventures we do not have an established customer base or a history of sales from which you can evaluate or predict out ability to gain customers and grow the business we have a limited amount of capital for inventory purchases but the establishment of customers for our products will require capital for inventory that we have not yet obtained or purchases of inventory under credit arrangements we have not arranged we do not have established market acceptance of our products so we are a new entrant in a wellestablished market for agrochemicals in which our competitors have wellknown products and much more substantial financial managerial and promotional resources than we do as product sales increase we will need to employ people to support that growth and there is no assurance that we will be able to attract and engage employees with the skills needed to facilitate the development of our business   results of operations   since the company was not engaged in active business operations in  a

statements included with this report our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and financial condition we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements   item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not required of a smaller reporting company   item   controls and procedures
