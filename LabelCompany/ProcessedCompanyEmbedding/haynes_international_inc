external links historyedit the company was founded by elwood haynes in  in kokomo indiana as haynes stellite works haynes had recently received a patent for a metal he created which he named stellite in  the company was purchased by union carbide in  the company invented its first alloy under the hastelloy brand derived from the first letters of the words haynes stellite alloy in  charles

banking firm of morgan lewis githens and ahn purchased the company in  the blackstone group purchased the company the debt incurred ultimately forced haynes into bankruptcy in march  from which it emerged  months later in august  in  the company opened an office in singapore its first sales office in asia in  the company acquired branford wire  manufacturing of mountain home north carolina in march  haynes completed a public equity offering current operationsedit in addition to kokomo haynes has manufacturing facilities in arcadia louisiana and mountain home north carolina the kokomo facility specializes in flat products the arcadia facility in tubular products and the mountain home facility in wire products the space shuttle’s engines have a total of  parts made from haynes

objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump

welding and fabrication overview the haynes® and hastelloy® alloys fall into two main categories corrosionresistant alloys cra which are generally used at temperatures below °f and are able to withstand corrosive liquids hightemperature alloys hta which are generally used above °f at which temperatures they possess considerable strength and resistance to hot air andor other hot gases the hightemperature alloys can also be subcategorized according to the mechanism used to provide their strength many of the alloys contain significant quantities of atomicallylarge elements these provide strength through a mechanism known as solidsolution strengthening other hta materials use a mechanism known as agehardening also known as precipitationhardening to attain the required strength levels there is also one agehardenable corrosionresistant alloy the heat treatments required to strengthen the agehardenable materials are normally performed after welding and hotcoldworking and prior to these heat treatments there is much in common with the fabrication techniquesparameters employed with the solidsolution strengthened alloys as long as they are supplied in the annealed condition as with the stainless steels and other alloy systems it is advantageous to have a rudimentary understanding of the metallurgical changes that might occur in the haynes® and hastelloy® alloys if exposed to the heat of welding the high temperatures involved with hotworking or the effects of annealing after coldworking if brazing is to be attempted it is very important to understand how the temperatures involved with brazing might affect the haynes® and hastelloy® materials or conversely how subsequent agehardening in the case of the agehardenable alloys or annealing treatments in the case of any of the alloys might affect the brazed joint in addition to the general purpose alloys manufactured by haynes international there are several special purpose alloys requiring different fabrication approaches one is a titanium alloy made only in the form of tubulars and for which fabrication references are given one is a hightemperature nickelbased alloy that requires a nitrogen diffusion treatment to impart strength to the material and for which there are some specific fabrication issues the other two are cobaltbased wearresistant alloys one of which is not normally welded or formed the other is easily welded but somewhat resistant to coldworking due to a high workhardening rate haynes international alloys base corrosionresistant alloys cra solidsolution agehardenable
