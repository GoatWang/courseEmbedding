now turn the call over to parameshparamesh gopithank you for joining us today we are very pleased with what weve accomplished this past quarter we delivered solid financial results highlighted by our th sequential quarter of revenue growth and nongaap earnings of  per share in fact this marks our first quarter of profitability since the beginning of let me start by reviewing key operating achievements from this past quarter and follow with important customer developments that illustrate the increasing traction we are seeing across our business first on the computer side i would like to highlight that hp enterprise the industrys leading storage vendor announced the launch of their high volume enterprise storage using our xgene armbased processor solutions second this was a milestone quarter for our connectivity business on multiple fronts notably the ieee standards body recommended the adoption of applied micro single lambda  gigabit per second pam solution to be an industry standard for enterprise and datacenter connectivity this is important because it positions applied micros technology as a solution of choice for datacenter connectivity going forwardwe expect an accelerated pam adoption cycle given the move towards standardizing around our approach and the clear value this technology brings to customers also on the connectivity front we saw record shipments of our xgene otm and five products across our tier  customer base an unprecedented demand for our industry leading ethernet security productsturning now to our computer business hp enterprise introduced the storevirtual  the industrys bit armbased high volume enterprise storage platform which is based on applied micros xgene technology this platform targets large enterprise customers and their private clouds hpe chose our xgene bit server on a chip solution because it provides a powerful computing engine multiple integrated gigabit and gigabit ethernet networking port and multiple pcie gen  lane for storage expansion all in a single socket xgene provided a clear and substantial cost savings for hpe when compared with existing x based platform solution this latest collaboration with hpe underscores the continued penetration of xgene based platforms into enterprise areas that were once effectively controlled by x based chipin addition during the quarter we successfully tapped out our nextgeneration xgene processor using tsmc  nanometer finfet technology we are thrilled to share with you that xgene is expected to deliver six times the performance of currently flipping xgene product and is targeted to compete with mainstream highend beyond e and e processors in a similar power with eight ddr channels xgene outclasses beyond e memory bandwidth making it well suited to hyperscale workload such as inmemory computing big data and machine learning xgene is built upon two generations of industry hardened and shipping products we continue to expect xgene samples will be available before the end of our fiscal year which ends in marchwe are seeing customer interest in this product as it offers socket levels beyond e and e class performance coupled with the maturity of an industry proven thirdgeneration product finally id like to report that we remain ontrack with our xgene deployments in asia where we are now running production traffic with one of the worlds top

guidance that was given by the company with that i will turn the call over to paramesh paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director thank you suzanne im pleased to announce that we closed our fiscal year with another quarter of sequential growth and that we exceeded our revenue and margin guidance in addition id like to highlight key accomplishments from this past quarter one we unveiled xgene  performance specifications at the recent open server summit xgene  is expected to be the first armbased soc to address the high end of the xeon mainstream server market by offering roughly six times the performance of currently shipping xgene products xgene s unprecedented level of overall performance combined with its bestinclass performance per watt makes it an ideal choice for mainstream highvolume servers according to linley gwennap xgene is a disruptive product with the potential to change the game for generalpurpose cloud computing please refer to the linley groups white paper covering the key performance attributes of xgene  as posted on linleygroupcom based on these performance estimates we see accelerating customer traction and interest from the top hyperscale data center operators both in the us and in china number two im also happy to announce that key hyperscale data center customers in china are making excellent progress with their xgene platforms number three apm demonstrated the industrys first singlelambda gigabitpersecond pam solution at the recent optical fiber communications conference and expects to lead the industrys transition to gig with customersponsored devices and finally i would now like to provide some color on the significant customer engagements and tractions that occurred this past quarter first im happy to note that we have secured pos and backlog that represent demand from key storage server and networking platform customers for our current xgene products second at mobile world congress we showed the kontron symkloud converged infrastructure platform powered by xgene this platform is designed to enable telco service providers to migrate their infrastructure from specialized hardware to commercialofftheshelf equipment supporting sdn and nfv capabilities leveraging the server class performance and power efficiency of xgene arm servers at open compute summit several of our platform partners announced new products based on xgene wistron a leading odm announced their x multiservices u ocp compliant chassis platform with xgene targeting both compute and storage market segment xs a leading supplier of customized data center solutions announced that they have selected appliedmicros xgene for their next generation vraptor servers in an ocp compliant form factor vapor io provider of the worlds first intelligent hyper modular data center solution announced collaboration with apm to deploy vapor ios open data center runtime environment on our node ocp compliant xgene  server platform the one half width one unit form factor server platform also integrates our xtend interconnect technology which enables multiple generations of xgene socs to be seamlessly connected as you can see xgene has established a very large footprint industrywide above all at the open server summit this year we announced our expected performance of xgene  our next generation flagship processor soc with performance competitive with mainstream highend xeon ee id like to highlight the key unique features for xgene  one high performance scores running over  gigahertz with strong scaling to  cores in a single socket delivering socket level performance that exceeds the high end xeon e family two eight ddr channels that support  terabyte per socket delivering the memory bandwidth and capacity of a p xeon in a single xgene  socket three generalpurpose pcie lanes to interconnect networking storage and acceleration io xgene  builds upon the foundation of two generations of server products which are battled hardened and that are currently shipping into a variety of data center storage and hpc platforms also at the open server summit we announced our followon generation xgene xl which scales from xgene s  cores to deliver  cores per socket and extends coherency across sockets to deliver a p smp symmetric multiprocessing system this continues our trajectory of delivering the leading edge compute performance at full rack scale finally were pleased to announced that weve started shipping helix our embedded arm product line to leading tier networking platforms were also seeing strong design win activity across a wide variety of embedded application including networking storage and industrial platforms turning now to our connectivity business id like to make three key points one for gig pam were the clear leader in this emerging high volume high growth data center optical connectivity market multiple oems have chosen to sponsor development activities by funding multiple customer specific standard products or cssps with us number two the complete component ecosystem for singlelambda pam has come together nicely as demonstrated by multiple optical component manufacturers at the recent optical fiber communications conference three we are now looking to extend our technology lead and are working with customers to develop sponsored  gigabit per second solutions additionally this quarter we have added three major tier design wins with our xweave otn and secure ethernet product families that will have revenue contributions starting this fiscal year with our xweave product line including pam secure ethernet and otn products we are poised to capture meaningful revenue growth in the high volume rapidly growing data center optical connectivity market let me summarize before i turn the call over to marty one our currentgeneration xgene products are making excellent progress in the storage server and networking market segments worldwide two xgene  is expected to be the first armbased soc to address the high end of the xeon mainstream server market by offering roughly six times the performance of currently shipping xgene products xgene s unprecedented level of overall performance combined with its bestinclass performance per watt makes it an ideal choice for mainstream highvolume servers we are extremely excited by the accelerating customer traction that has resulted based on our performance estimates number three we are leading the  and gigabitpersecond pam market as evidenced by multiple customersponsored standard product engagements for our singlelambda nanometer finfet technology with that ill turn the call over to marty our cfo for a review of the march quarter financials and our june quarter guidance marty martin s mcdermut  chief financial officer thank you paramesh and good afternoon everyone ill start with a review of the financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter  follow with comments on our balance sheet and finish with our fiscal first quarter  guidance fiscal fourth quarter  revenues gross margins and earnings either met or exceeded our guidance total revenues for the quarter increased to  million a slight increase over the third quarter our fifth consecutive quarter increase connectivity revenues increased to  million as we commented last quarter the growth was primarily driven by customersponsored engagements for our nanometer pam and mixedsignal technologies computing revenues totaled  million lower than the prior quarter but in line with earlier quarters as expected xgene revenues continue to grow nongaap gross margin was  higher compared to the prior quarter and guidance due to the greater portion of connectivity revenues and revenues from customersponsored engagements nongaap operating expenses totaled  million higher than the prior quarter due to increased rd expense and lower than our guidance due to the shift of an anticipated mask tapeout nongaap tax expense was  our nongaap net loss narrowed to  million or  per share on a gaap basis the net loss for the quarter was  million or  per share our nongaap financials exclude certain items required by gaap a complete reconciliation between gaap and nongaap financials is available in our fiscal fourth quarter  earnings release which can be found in the investor relations section of our website turning to the balance sheet our cash and shortterm investments were  million up from the  million at the end of the prior quarter cash flow from operations totaled  million and cash from issuance of employee stock purchase plan shares totaled  million which more than offset capital spending and other use of funds since most of the cash from operations resulted from temporary changes in working capital we expect cash to return to the  million to  million level in the next quarter or two finally ill turn to our outlook for the fiscal first quarter  these are estimates based on our current knowledge and are subject to change as such theyre covered under our safe harbor statement we estimate revenue will range from  million to  million we have good backlog coverage and channel inventories are lean we expect nongaap gross margins will be in the range of  to  nongaap operating expenses are expected to be in the range of  million to  million which is up slightly compared to the prior quarter primarily due to the timing of the mask tapeout i talked about earlier we expect our nongaap tax expense will be approximately  and finally we expect nongaap earnings per share for the quarter to be a loss of  – plus or minus  in summary we continue to demonstrate financial and operational discipline as we execute on our operating plan well continue to invest in the companys future growth and remain focused on maximizing shareholder value and operator please open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from matt ramsay of canaccord genuity your line is open please go ahead matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc yes thank you very much for letting me ask a question good afternoon guys paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director hey matt how are you matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc doing well thank you i guess the first question ill ask is for marty maybe you could talk a little bit about the – a little bit lower than expected revenue in the computing business and the mix thereof with the gross margins moving higher is this a shift maybe away from some of the legacy powerpc products more quickly than we had anticipated just any color on that mix and how it impacts the margins would be helpful as a start thanks martin s mcdermut  chief financial officer okay overall the shift – youve seen it shift around the past year and so this is back in line with the prior quarter prior to q i expect that well be at that level on this coming quarter the margins are definitely – they are impacted connectivity has higher margin as we talked about that up to  higher i mean thats sort of whats driving and whats driving the moves in the margins and as you could see from the guidance this coming quarter the margins are higher if you take the range that ive given so we expect it to probably come in around the same levels matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc got it got it and i guess should we think about these type of margins being sustainable on a gross margin basis going forward based on the mix or is there something that we should think about it in future quarters sort of pushing it back down into the range weve been in the last few quarters thanks martin s mcdermut  chief financial officer we dont give what guidance farther out than a quarter so ill have to  matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc fair enough paramesh theres been a few things happened in the ecosystem some of which are quite exciting around your xgene  platform maybe you can just talk a little bit more in detail about how the customer interactions have gone with that and then secondly as i guess somewhat related comment amd is certainly been pushing to get back into the server space for a while and there is a big jv announcement in china that was quite topical in the capital markets maybe you can give your impressions of that as an alternative to – i mean lots of folks trying to diversify away from intel but there is i guess a new x player thats reemerged itself now so how that might impact your business one way or the other going forward thanks paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director so matt maybe i can address the first part of the question weve talked about xgene  we first talked about it at last november or early – late november or early december with arm techcon we had received test ships recognized that the biggest innovation that weve been working on for the last twoandahalf years is the really really robust coherent interconnect between all these cores and weve really done a lot of work to scale that up and for the first time we talked about the performance numbers i think we were very pleased that linley who is an independent analyst essentially for the first time when he saw those performance numbers clearly understood the impact that its going to have relative to the whole arm soc space so i think its been phenomenal because the customer traction that has resulted from the actual performance estimates i mean obviously we disclosed the performance estimates at open server summit and the one thing thats happened over the last six months is that people have really used the first two generations of shipping product developed software theyve used the first two generations and theyve learned a lot in terms of what it means to really kind of inflect the market mainstream so now were talking about the full range of compute –  were just talking about the full range of everything that we could possibly go and intercept a skylake type generation with so i think the proven mature robust shipping technology coupled with the innovation in terms of scaling it up to  cores and up to  cores with xgene xl were now at a point where technologywise weve really really established the key pieces for arm to exist in this market in the appropriate way compared to the mainstream x right number one number two when you talked about amd in china from our perspective its interesting to see this announcement china as you know has for the longest time over the last few years we mentioned this earlier been a big proponent of having a nonx open ecosystem right and i think that drive continues to be there our engagements and customer traction in china is really really good people are – theyve ported software theyve got all of the evaluation initial pieces all run and i think from our perspective its great that theyre looking at x but i got to tell you that arm camp is really very very strong relative to the fact that it has no ties whatsoever to intel so i dont think the amd news changes our prospectus all relative to arm being there in fact i think it actually enhances it matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc thank you very much for the perspectives good afternoon paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director thanks operator thank you our next question comes from chris longiaru from sidoti your line is open christopher j longiaru  sidoti  co llc hey guys thanks for taking my question so i caught the open server summit presentation and you talked a lot about comparative specint when i go in and look at some of these theyre kind of all over the map so it depends on who you look at and what theyre using it for so where does yours fit in with respect to somebody like a cisco or anything along those lines can you give me a little bit of color there paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director so at the open server summit we talked about processors specint numbers that have to do with per socket performance for different classes of server parts today that are currently being shipped by intel right because they are the incumbent in the market so what we won – what we showed at open server summit was that for the first time we had something that was well north of  specint per socket at the right socket power the standard socket power that today intel ships p systems with so what that does is it breaks two barriers breaks performanceperwatt barriers and more importantly we can support terabyte of memory per socket that breaks the entire memory to processor – number of processors barrier so what weve done is essentially give you a real alternative to skylake in a much more differentiated and tangible way christopher j longiaru  sidoti  co llc okay and how does that move i mean whats the goal with the next version of xgene as you move through that because right now i think you said youre – that xgene  is sort of pushing the highend of e and above that are you looking towards kind of more momentum with the next version and kind of attacking some of the e class paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director yeah so i think if you were to go and reflect on intels roadmap and reflect on the changes that have happened there i think for the first time were seeing the convergence of the e and e classes of processors into one big mainstream e bucket and this squarely addresses that in a very very disruptive way christopher j longiaru  sidoti  co llc ill jump out thank you very much paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our next question comes from cody acree from drexel hamilton your line is open david williams  drexel hamilton llc yeah thanks for taking the question this is david on for cody its a little bit of a busy earnings night for us i wanted to say first congrats on the linley white paper it obviously was very positive comparisons against xeon can you talk a little bit may be about the genesis of the paper and you covered a little bit of it already but can you really maybe give us highlight what you thought were the key takeaways from the report paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director sure so i think for the first time in the – and i guess in apms brief history of arm we had the opportunity to really leverage all of the existing shipping products maturity weve actually built a whole ecosystem around xgene for arm and you think about the span of platforms between xgene  and xgene  really in the storage server space we have pos for those types of parts today weve already talked about how they will affect our revenue towards the second half of our fiscal year as well as on the embedded side we talked about helix shipping into key networking tier oem switches one of the things that we had not talked about was what between xgene  xgene  and xgene  there is a pretty big quantum leap in terms of performance right and what we did was we took twoandahalf years we essentially in stealth developed the key pieces of the interconnect that would let us scale the number of cores up from  to  and now to  right so the genesis is if you really look at linley linley is a pretty recognized industry analyst hes probably been one of the founders of the microprocessor report he has had a lot to do with essentially commenting on the microprocessor industry and being very data driven one of the things that we did this time is we actually have estimates of all the performance data both from emulation as well as our test silicon so we were able to really boil it all up before the product comes out and really talk it through as we exposed the product in the marketplace in the future right so what it did was it – for the first time offered an analyst or other analyst the ability to quantify all of the innovation that we had made technologically and thus the genesis of the white paper david williams  drexel hamilton llc great thanks and then maybe could you give maybe a little stratification of what youre seeing in terms of design activity where are you seeing the most strength and have you seen any major changes in the pace over the last quarter paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director our design activity has grown from the previous quarter and its kind of grown on two vectors the amount of interest in xgene  has frankly been extremely exciting given the fact that we offer a skylakeclass part in that category right now and the other thing thats been really exciting is all of the current generation ill call it processor exceed the current generation parts moving like in the storage server front into early production right and then i really want to – i dont want to leave you with – i want to leave you with one more message were really excited about our optical connectivity business i mean we have two engines and the optical connectivity engine is really helping us as you saw our margins we are clearly driving pam into highvolume data center applications working with leading oems leading webcentric module folks and the web data center operators to really drive this technology mainstream because we are the only ones whove taken the bold step of putting that technology into nanometer finfet enabling the right density and the right power for these  and gig installations david williams  drexel hamilton llc great and then the last one for me you talked a little bit about the competitor landscape a while ago but are you hearing anything from customer engagements about maybe their level of potential interest in other arm alternatives i know you guys are clearly the leader but are you hearing any discussions from customers about potentially looking at other arm alternatives paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director honestly i think weve said this before i think were very uniquely positioned given the fact that we were awarded the uniserver award for the h uniserver technology evaluation clearly puts us kind of head and shoulders above anybody else in terms of maturity in terms of technology leadership i think that were happy to see that the rich ecosystem of people are participating in it its great for us but i think from our perspective weve been really forthcoming in terms of where we want to go with this i mean weve now announced basically oneandahalf more generations of technology and to give people an idea of where all this will land relative to skylake and skylake plus right thats the real target for us david williams  drexel hamilton llc great thanks so much best of luck to you on next quarter paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our next question comes from hans mosesmann from raymond james your line is open hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc thanks hey paramesh can you give us a sense of the unit expectation for the fiscal year for xgene i think last quarter you mentioned  to  is that still the working assumption paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director no change hans in fact i think we said  to  from  to  months take that and subtract three months so  to  months no change hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc okay and then – and that implies the exit rate for the year xgene being around  of sales paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think thats what marty had indicated last time correct martin s mcdermut  chief financial officer correct hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc can you give us the exit level or q of the fiscal year what percent of sales could be coming from pam paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director i dont think weve broken that out but what we did say last time and marty what – the exact number we said was that it was going to be high singledigit percentages of our yearly revenue so you can imagine look at – if you really look at it the clear proof of the leadership is in the fact that we can talk about this as the market emerges so which is really neat hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc okay so pam high single digits of fiscal  paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director total revenue fiscal  revenue correct yeah hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc okay and just for modeling purposes is the september quarter kind of like the quarter where you start to see the ramp there at pam paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director i think what weve said is that weve been – i dont think weve broken it out by quarter suffice it to say that these engagements are already in progress hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc okay hey marty and just a followup for you on the financial side the gross margin guidance is high is that a continuation of the customer payments for pam martin s mcdermut  chief financial officer its a combination of connectivitys being at that steady state being a higher portion than prior quarter and these engagements these customersponsored engagements drive it up hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc and then the last one and ill let others ask questions for the rest of the fiscal year how should we expect margins to kind of play out martin s mcdermut  chief financial officer we said that we dont give guidance more than a quarter out hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc so when would the martin s mcdermut  chief financial officer i was going to say let me just comment that paramesh did say that this were real excited about the pam opportunities and the customersponsorship and the effect it has on the margin so hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc okay and so i just want to get a sense of so this is an ongoing thing with this customer after this quarter the june quarter can we paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director so hans let me go and set some context for you so that there is absolute clarity here number one we have multiple customers sponsoring customerspecific products for the high volume data center interconnectivity market which means that typically this follows more of a customer specific standard product model from the likes of the avagos of the world these things usually stretch – development stretch is anywhere between  months to  months after which you have a volume because that is very large because theyve skin in the game which is why they are actually working with us to build these products so i think that should give you context of the framework that you should think about hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc okay very helpful thanks guys paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director thank you hans operator our next question is from suji de silva from topeka your line is open suji de silva  topeka capital markets hi paramesh hi marty a question on the products portfolio you have now are you still seeing that xgene xweave pam and helix are all kind of selling independently or are there instances where the customer wants two or three of these together for a specific reason paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director no i would treat them as completely independent at this point suji de silva  topeka capital markets okay thats fair and then the other thing is looking ahead to sort of intel skylake and on the future and they are making architectural shifts perhaps to kind of match some of the things you guys are bringing to the market i just want to understand how you contrast to what they may be trying to move toward in xgene  and where the competitive differentiation will be in that future point if you can comment on that paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director sure two things that we bring one is for the first time were actually bringing you e class memory so you have eight channels of ddr you can support a terabyte per socket along with really really robust highend e class core so weve actually essentially done our own version of collapsing two large pieces of performance into one die right so with xgene  you have from a technology point of view something that converges the need of all of our hyperscale customers which is to deconstraint memory and compute performance number one number two with xgene xl we talked about i mean by the way one other thing before i move on i made this in my prepared comments were essentially taking a p system and putting it on one die with xgene  suji and then weve gone one step further and we talked about the announcement of the technology that comes after xgene  which is xgene xl where we essentially are able to do  cores on one die right so what we are essentially doing is really making sure that from a technology perspective were going to offer the absolutely top class performance for arm compute along with no constraints or as little constraints as possible on the memory subsystem supported for a single physical implementation of the socket does that kind of makes sense suji de silva  topeka capital markets yeah i was just wondering if what intel is doing in terms of their roadmap starts to move towards that opportunity as well with their – are they bundled things or whether thats not what you perceive beyond their roadmap paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director well ill give you one example right if you look at the highest ne thats been announcement or i think has been talked about there theyre only talking about six channels of memory suji de silva  topeka capital markets yes paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director so the price quanta between six channels of memory and eight channels of memory is a massive step function again what were doing is giving customers or deconstraining them from memory and core performance were actually offering you both at the right intersect point youre not going to have to pay huge amounts of extra dollars to get access to more memory thats a huge differentiation right suji de silva  topeka capital markets yeah very helpful paramesh maybe one question for marty marty whats the operating leverage in the model longer term just help us understand maybe quantify or just qualitatively just kind of explain that martin s mcdermut  chief financial officer i mean our approach here is to have minimal growth in the expenses as we start to ramp the revenues up to where we get rapidly accelerating to higher operating margins in the s suji de silva  topeka capital markets all right very clear okay thanks guys paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director thanks suji operator our next question is from krishna shankar from roth capital your line is open please go ahead krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc yes paramesh congratulations on the xgene milestones as you talk about the connectivity business and the guidance for q is a lot of the growth for the june quarter driven by the connectivity business or how much of that is also due to embedded and the continuing ramp of xgene paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director so i think krishna all those three contribute to the next quarters revenue number from our perspective i made some comments earlier on on the call we are now engaged with multiple connectivity customers to bring gig and gig to the market we also talked about the multiple customersponsored standard products – customer specific standard products that were engaged in thats one component the other component of it is helix helix is ramping in some of the worlds largest networking switch skus and the other piece of it is obviously xgene which i think marty mentioned in his prepared comments has sequentially grown so i think all those three are contributing to the number next quarter and i think from our perspective also frame this with a notion that these customersponsored engagements will span a year and that started last quarter right a year to  months so i hope that gives you enough color to kind of see where things are going and thats why were very excited krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc okay and then what makes the optical connectivity chip customer specific does this work with their a for switching or router application or what makes this customer specific as opposed to applicationspecific standard part paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director thats a really really good question so two or three things one is most of these customers are driven by shipping into really large enterprises or data centers so you can know where the volume are large when that happens you usually have your own ip whether its ip that relates to your particular algorithm to do something proprietary for a rack or a server cluster thats one piece the other piece of it is frankly the optics at the end whats going to drive this market is the ability to have really good cost points for optics so various people who are shipping very high volume today in this market or data center customers who are buying very high volume have really centered on how do we bring the right algorithms to play to drive the correct set of optics at the right cost and var points and what they need is the right silicon foundation which is nanometer  and gig serdes and  and dacs and we bring that along with our dsp so think of programmability the right mixedsignal power and density product that is being offered to a guy who either runs the data center or who ships into a data center and that makes the whole thing kind of hum krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc okay got it and then just final question on the xgene currently are you shipping both the xgene  and xgene  for revenues paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director yes krishna shankar  roth capital partners llc okay thank you paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director thanks krishna operator we have a follow up question from matt ramsay from canaccord your line is open matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc yeah paramesh thanks for let me jump back in the pam sort of sponsored or semicustom design that your guys are doing maybe you could just talk to us philosophically about that type of engagement right so why pursue that type of engagement versus just interacting with the customer and pursuing a roadmap why are they willing to pay upfront its a very different revenue model from what you guys – i mean as you mentioned some others in the industry have done that but its something new for your team so just maybe a little bit around that and just if there is any weird accounting or anything that goes along with that because its a little bit different and its obviously impacting the margins quite a bit so i just think sort of little clarity there might be helpful thank you paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director so can i maybe start by saying that this is not a strange model for the company ill remind you if you go back five years alcatellucent i can tell you this because it was five years ago used to pay us to build cssps for them other big optical companies have done the same where we can have a version of it that we can sell commercially and a version of it that we can customize for them so a the model is not new to the company what is new to the company is the mixedsignal technology that were bringing to this whole market so let me take a step back ill go back and tell you that the key to the optical connectivity market in the data center are the ability to get the lowest power per gigabit per second of traffic optical module into a faceplate of a switch or a cluster – into a faceplate at the top of the rack switch or a cluster switch in other words the traffic is growing at a hyperexponential rate i mean if you look at ciscos estimates or googles estimates you can see that right so gig today exists in the form of a very big by or by or by type of solution which does not fit into a qsfp type form factor and a power that is anywhere between  and  watts per port now lets look at where things are going its pretty clear that this is going to be the year of gig ethernet ports on switches right thats happening the switch market is moving there its also pretty clear that the rate at which traffic is going several clusters are going to have multiterabit switches that are going to be connecting them together thats already happened in some of the big data centers its going to happen across both the data center and the enterprise so what did we do and why are we in this pole position three years ago we made the bet that we wanted to take all of our fundamental longhaul forward error correction ip all of our ad and da technology that weve developed for things that are lower rates like the gigabit rate or the gigabit rate or the gigabit rate all of serdes components and then move them to finfet as well as move the fundamental programmable dsp engine that we had to accommodate these types of functions for nanometer finfet so the end of that entire ip creation process was somewhere in the fall of last year a bunch of customers including end data center operators wanted to see this kind of working because they couldnt believe that we could move all this ip at a particular power point and get them what they wanted so now as soon as we showed what we were able to do between the optics maturing between people wanting the higher densities at the lowest possible power at the lowest possible cost they basically said well you guys are the only ones with proven ip and so what they did was in one fell swoop all of the people who were going to ship millions of units over the next three to five years decided that they needed to partner with us does that answer the question matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc yeah and thats helpful for context i appreciate the patience thanks paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director no problem operator we have a second followup question from the line of hans mosesmann from raymond james your line is open hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc yeah thanks hey paramesh can you give us a sense of the state of the connectivity market the endmarket data center versus the service provider whats happening out there as you engage with customers just on an ongoing basis paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director sure i think its pretty clear that – let me start with the data center first and ill get to the service provider its pretty clear that every data center guy that weve talked to or that has engaged with us today have – and in their minds once we showed them the gig technology theyre like okay where is gig so people are already starting to move their entire focus to saying youve now demonstrated gig working were going to go now and move this to more of a – okay its the technology piece of it is done you guys are on the path to develop really compelling customizations for various highvolume applications how do we now bring your focus to gig because when you have a bunch of gig front ports on a switch you need something to aggregate them all so the next big logical alternative is gig right so a data center guy today if you talk to the leading guys who are shipping – im not talking about shipping  units for data center interconnect between data centers im talking about guys who basically run a million servers okay all those guys are basically telling us guys we need to accelerate gig first of all get gig done – you guys are done lets go focus on gig thats where the state of the industry and the customer traction is today gig is yesterdays – as far as theyre concerned we have a path we know the cost points were going to deal with it you guys are it now how do we build gig thats where everybodys focused on in terms of optics in terms of mixed signal in terms of serdes et cetera spending there hans continues unabated in fact ill quote a very large data center operator and he told me this less than six weeks ago he said if you guys had a gig a year ago i would have used it i would be buying it so theyre not waiting – i mean they want the higher rates right thats number one number two as far as the service provider is concerned i think its interesting to see a lot of the service provider equipment that people like alcatel and cisco are building being consumed by data center operators or being consumed by the service provisioning piece of att or verizon that deals with the data center operators you know that verizon had a major contract thats happened this summer thats really helped we talked about it in the past it has had a very positive effect on these margins as you can see today we also see the peering points that att has with guys like amazon or facebook starting to use more and more carrier class equipment or packet optical equipment where our chips are being designed in so fundamentally i think youll see the data center market driving and the service provider market following and youll see service provider platform is being used in the data center market and vice versa in the future does that kind of makes sense hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc yeah it does it does another question if i can was there any impact to the zte situation that was announced in early march paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director go ahead marty martin s mcdermut  chief financial officer yeah well the issue has been resolved i think we do sell to zte we said that the revenues are about mid single digits to us right now the issues have been resolved we are shipping to them and recognizing revenue if that changes if the us government decides to cut them off again its possible that were going to have an impact to our results however somebody else would probably going to step in and start shipping product if they drop out of a market but right now its business as usual and we are not aware of any other issues out there at this point hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc okay thank you very much paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director thanks hans operator thank you at this time im showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back over to paramesh gopi for closing remarks paramesh gopi  president chief executive officer  director yeah thank you all for taking the time and have a good day operator ladies and

quarter  earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later we will conduct a questionandanswer session and instructions will be given at that time operator instructions as a reminder todays conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to ms suzanne schmidt with investor relations maam you may begin suzanne schmidt thank you operator good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining todays conference call on the call with me today are dr paramesh gopi president and ceo and marty mcdermut cfo before we begin i would like to remind you that various remarks that we make on this call including those about future financial results including revenues gross margins operating expenses design wins product plans our competitive situation market trends statements about future development production and adoption of xgene xweave helix xtend and other products and technologies and our anticipated growth and profitability all constitute forwardlooking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act these forwardlooking statements and all other statements that may be made on this call that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially we refer you to our most recent form q filed with the sec in particular to the section entitled risk factors and to other reports that we may file from time to time with the sec for additional information on the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations these forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date hereof and we disclaim any obligation to update them i would like to point out that a number of the securities analysts that cover our stock use various financial measures and this creates a range of variability relative to the street financial models when we say street estimates we mean the consensus of the major financial analyst models and they are not necessarily the guidance that was given by the company with that i will now turn the call over to paramesh paramesh gopi thank you for joining us today we are very pleased with what weve accomplished this past quarter we delivered solid financial results highlighted by our th sequential quarter of revenue growth and nongaap earnings of  per share in fact this marks our first quarter of profitability since the beginning of  let me start by reviewing key operating achievements from this past quarter and follow with important customer developments that illustrate the increasing traction we are seeing across our business first on the computer side i would like to highlight that hp enterprise the industrys leading storage vendor announced the launch of their high volume enterprise storage using our xgene armbased processor solutions second this was a milestone quarter for our connectivity business on multiple fronts notably the ieee standards body recommended the adoption of applied micro single lambda  gigabit per second pam solution to be an industry standard for enterprise and datacenter connectivity this is important because it positions applied micros technology as a solution of choice for datacenter connectivity going forward we expect an accelerated pam adoption cycle given the move towards standardizing around our approach and the clear value this technology brings to customers also on the connectivity front we saw record shipments of our xgene otm and five products across our tier  customer base an unprecedented demand for our industry leading ethernet security products turning now to our computer business hp enterprise introduced the storevirtual  the industrys bit armbased high volume enterprise storage platform which is based on applied micros xgene technology this platform targets large enterprise customers and their private clouds hpe chose our xgene bit server on a chip solution because it provides a powerful computing engine multiple integrated gigabit and gigabit ethernet networking port and multiple pcie gen  lane for storage expansion all in a single socket xgene provided a clear and substantial cost savings for hpe when compared with existing x based platform solution this latest collaboration with hpe underscores the continued penetration of xgene based platforms into enterprise areas that were once effectively controlled by x based chip in addition during the quarter we successfully tapped out our nextgeneration xgene processor using tsmc  nanometer finfet technology we are thrilled to share with you that xgene is expected to deliver six times the performance of currently flipping xgene product and is targeted to compete with mainstream highend beyond e and e processors in a similar power with eight ddr channels xgene outclasses beyond e memory bandwidth making it well suited to hyperscale workload such as inmemory computing big data and machine learning xgene is built upon two generations of industry hardened and shipping products we continue to expect xgene samples will be available before the end of our fiscal year which ends in march we are seeing customer interest in this product as it offers socket levels beyond e and e class performance coupled with the maturity of an industry proven thirdgeneration product finally id like to report that we remain ontrack with our xgene deployments in asia where we are now running production traffic with one of the worlds top eight megadata center operator turning now to our connectivity business as i mentioned earlier this was a milestone quarter on a number of fronts as you know our connectivity business provides otm framers mappers five ethernet security products and pam technology to tier  data center and service providers around the world we would like to take this opportunity to provide color on the importance of our pam technology to the future of enterprise and data center connectivity picture a large data center  million to  million square feet in size several stories high and filled with network serverrack on a fixed power button the only way to content rapid traffic good within such a data center is to enable high capacity low power connectivity between servers and switches current gigabit per second module solutions use either two or four lasers and a corresponding number of photodiode ph this results in high power high cost and low density thereby limiting the number of connections within a fixed power footprint the current solutions use  nanometer planar processes and unoptimized photonics in contrast our single lambda pam enables a single laser module to carry four times the data rate when compared with current module our groundbreaking dsp and analog mixed signal  nanometer finfet solutions leap frog todays high power multilaser solutions by enabling a low power high density and highly manufacturable module with  fewer optical components and  better power efficiency we believe our pam technology to be the most viable way to scale current enterprise and data center connectivity to gigabit per second with an industry standard module form factor consequently tier  oem have committed nre dollars to applied micro towards  and gigabit per second custom solution providing us good visibility on customer demand and market adoption the readiness of  or gigabit per second pam was demonstrated at the recent european conference on optical communications where our partners and us demonstrated a fully operational gig single laser pam solution over singlemode fiber this also served as the catalyst for the industrywide ieee standardization process and announcement that i mentioned earlier moving now to our secured ethernet product we have expanded our customer footprint beyond north american and european tier  sockets and are pleased to announce our first design win in china we would like to reiterate our expectation that secured ethernet revenues will begin to ramp in the first part of calendar  all of this clearly demonstrate a significant fraction we are seeing for our connectivity products worldwide to summarize our key business highlights from the quarter industryleading storage oem are shifting platforms powered by xgene xgene has successfully kept up finally momentum in our connectivity business continues to accelerate driven by our pam products and our x ph and secured ethernet solution i will now turn the call over to marty mcdermut our cfo for a review of the september quarter financials and our december quarter guidance martin mcdermut thank you paramesh and good afternoon everyone ill start with a review of the financial results for the fiscal second quarter  follow with comments on our balance sheet and finish with our fiscal third quarter  guidance our key financial metrics for the fiscal second quarter  came in at or above guidance ranges that we provided last quarter total revenues for the quarter increased to  million our seventh consecutive quarterly revenue increase connectivity revenues increased to  million the sequential growth was driven by increased sales of our otm and fi products and by strong customer demand across tier  data center and service provider customer platform our new products accounted for most of the game our xweave gig otm framer is mapping in some of the bestselling platforms in the industry and our xweave secured ethernet products initial ramp also contributed to this upside computing revenues totaled  million for the quarter lower sequentially due to order patterns for our legacy powerpc products nongaap gross margin was  above the high end of our guidance range gross margins increased sequentially due to the higher mix of connectivity revenue improved yields lower materials and other cost nongaap operating expenses totaled  million lower than the prior quarter primarily due to lower mask tapeout and new product introduction costs our nongaap tax expense was  nongaap net income for the september quarter was  million or  per share on a gaap basis the net loss for the quarter was  million or  per share more than  reduction from the gaap loss per share during the prior quarter our nongaap financials exclude certain items required by gaap a complete reconciliation between gaap and nongaap financials is available on our fiscal second quarter  earnings release which can be found in the investor relations section of our website turning to the balance sheet our cash and shortterm investments was  million down slightly from  million at the end of the prior quarter operating activity used  excluding working capital changes operations generated  million positive cash flow we used  for capital expenditures which was more than offset by cash from issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan our balance sheet continues to be well managed our networking capital increased by  billion dollars to  million current assets increased by  million and were partially offset by  increase in the liabilities our day sales outstanding and our accounts receivables was  and based on ending inventory returns are about  finally ill turn to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter  and these are estimates based on our current knowledge and are subject to change as such they are covered by a safe harbor statement we estimate revenues will range between  million and  million we continue to have strong backlog coverage we expect nongaap gross margins be in the range of  to  nongaap operating expenses are expected to be in the range  million to  million in line with this last quarter and we expect our nongaap tax expense will be approximately  finally we expect nongaap earnings per share for the quarter to be income of  plus or minus  and with that operator please open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator certainly operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of cody acree with drexel hamilton your line is now open cody acree thanks for taking my questions and congratulations guys on the progress and return to profitability maybe marty if we could just start with you on the strong gross margins i guess if were continuing to see this level of connectivity growth how high can those margins go and then as you start to see xgene ramp in and what might be the impact of  how does that level off margins at some point martin mcdermut okay one i mean it is you could see the connectivity revenues through the last quarter and that accounted for almost all of the increase there was some part of the increase due to the lower doing the cost reduction effort weve said that during the last quarters call that i think if were in the low s per margin on an average basis thats a good place for you to target but its going to move around quarter to quarter because our product mix moves quartertoquarter looking out into the next team ramps going in the next year i mean there  thats more middle of the road margins for us so there will be  i dont expect a lot of impact from it going forward paramesh gopi so cody just to give me some more clarity  you can see how strong our connected business have been  its been a phenomenal quarter for us i also recognize that team actually consistently moved our margin profile up which is what we said we were going to do and we were  we are continuing to drive that going forward because our new products that be ramping extremely good margin profile on both sides of the business cody acree paramesh if we can switch gears  i guess and help us maybe understand some of the impact of some of your announcements this quarter specifically around the ieee standard how did that come about what does that mean for the world how does that accelerate things and how do we put some kind of volume estimates around paramesh gopi very good question so i think there has been a lot of talk about pam for the last  probably two years and really people have essentially used that in a in a loose way to talk about multiple types of optical module solution for the first time i think there is a significant two move towards changing the module landscape going forward to have a singlelaser gigabit per second and the only way you can do that in a sub four to five module is to have in fact advanced dsp technology and advanced mixed signal analog technology all come together with photonics so i think there has been a lot of talk about pam we have  we now have taken all of  probably three and a half years worth of work that we have done and have led the industry from a development pointofview and it was our solution that catalyzed a move to standardize the technology across module form factors and module members what does that do first of all it renders the two laser and four solutions rather important going forward second it starts to really build a new ecosystem of  and gig type modules in  weve always said that this is going to happen people are paying us to build semicustom solutions for volumes and now you have a standards body thats going to make it a mandate so what does that do for us it puts us on a very nice track to having a very clear visible growth pattern over the next few years and its no longer determined by elastic factors that are beyond our control but mostly all now driven by standards and we probably have in my opinion  twoyear lead on anybody else so we stand to gain and poised to gain a very  expect to gain a very good share of this market as it evolves cody acree and then lastly the workload orders that you received last quarter  you talked about last quarter have you used followon orders or any feedback that you can talk about just how is that  those first workload orders starting to shape up paramesh gopi so cody can you rewind when you say workload can you be more specific cody acree well you announced on the last call that you have received your first workload orders production server orders for xgene and you talked about two different customers service provider and data center operator im just wondering what the feedback has been from the customers have they come in and ordered more just what is the statement here paramesh gopi they are doing the feedback is definitely we mentioned one of them in our prepared remarks they are fully in the production traffic phases so this is now realtime in their yield production environment and so thats a huge validation of the technology and its robustness and the other engagement proceeding just as we expected and we are very pleased with the progress on it operator and our next question comes from the line of matt ramsay with canaccord genuity your line is now open matthew ramsay thank you very much good afternoon paramesh i wanted to followup on the pam stuff and obviously you guys are making progress there with the indiscernible and the nre funded work for a couple of partners specifically though could you talk to any kind of potential revenue target in the  to  time frame for you guys and if there are any contractual volume orders attached to any of those nre payments that you can walk us through a little bit just so that we can bound the problem and lastly just to complete that conversation i think we had talked in the past about say  million pam for those type of modules is that still sort of a ball park pam that youre going after there thanks paramesh gopi yes so let me start by saying that yes there are volumes associated with all those contractual agreements yes we said there are going to be high signal percentage of our yearly revenue fully on track and yes all of those will start the ramp in the second half of our fiscal  of calendar  we talked about and yes the ieee standardization does accelerate and make certain the way this market evolve now to go back to your pam question the pam for all optics in that market is i think too close to what we said between  million and  million specifically for single lambda and for what i call single lambda  and  gig there is going to be an adoption code associated with that market i believe that adoption curve will start to really ramp towards the second half of our  and the fact that were leading the charge there along with the various photonics partners and the ieee gives an extremely good position to take a good share of that market just you asked about quantifying this market if you really think about it matt before the ieee standards process you would say that for typical market ramp were talking about for a new technology to ramp in to an existing market it takes between  and  months that is with no standards with standards we will definitely see at least a  change in the adoption grade curve so that should give you an idea of how to map and how to model this but nobody gives guys like us significant financial dollars upfront without a volume commitment as you know matthew ramsay i guess for either of you guys i want to get a little bit more of an understanding as to the decline of the computing revenue in your prepared remarks you attributed that mostly to declines of legacy powerpc products maybe you can talk about the magnitude of the legacy product declines amount of that particular types of legacy products that are still in the revenue runrate and how we should think about modeling the strip out xgene for now but the nonxgene portion of the computing business how we should think about modeling that for the next several quarters obviously that revenue has moved around quite a bit thanks paramesh gopi as i said in remarks too that we cyclicality from that product line now going i think in the last quarters call i talked about that we see headwinds not from all the compute ph products but from some of them which is dampening the impact of the ramp that were seeing in our new products i expect those to be declining to go away early next year when you start seeing additional growth from the top line technical difficulty of both sides martin mcdermut so matt just to be clear i dont know whether youve noticed a number of that is actually indiscernible we had a  million connectivity quarter and our guidance reflects two things one is the connectivity business being very strong margins being very strong and were able to essentially take the powerpc declines and obviously supplement that in large part as arms start to take market share with our connectivity revenue so from a planning perspective were very confident that the connectivity business and our base business is extremely robust and not just robust from a margin perspective but just look at the rate of designing i think last time we said we close through the record quarter for our design win closure right so were extremely wellpoised to drive our base connectivity business indiscernible to sustain our company and growth projects matthew ramsay thats helpful i need to sneak in one more to be a little more granular on the forward outlook for the rest of the fiscal year would you think that this would be a trough quarter for the combined computing business or is there still some of that legacy business that might come out im just trying to figure out how model mix going forward and how that might relate to gross margins thanks guys martin mcdermut we stopped the range for this coming quarter we brought down you know the margins a little bit and thats because you will see a shift in the business between connectivity and computing so i think as we said some headwinds going forward but its to be stable in the last probably should be stable through the end of the year paramesh gopi and to add to what marty said if you go back and look at the margin band in our guidance were walking the margin band up by a couple of percentage points every single quarter that should give you a good way to assess the robustness and underpinnings of the way we run our business operator and our next question comes from the line of steven smigie with raymond james your line is now open steven smigie i was looking to followup a little bit technical difficulty and production the sampling you talked about can you talk a little bit about breadth of customers that you expect on the sampling and then in terms of timing how long from a sample to win technical difficulty paramesh gopi sure just to be clear right i mean this is going to be the actual first and most significant part from an arm  perspective that will have the ability to compete with skylink ph and we have talked about this over the last quarter or quarter and half we have actually had many announcements and many i will call it indiscernible in terms of what it can do i recognize that we see very wide interest all the way from where our existing customers where mega data center operators to enterprise type folks like hpe who are already shipping actually one type programs with us but our focus technical difficulty to be clear is that mega data center kind of market and i believe that it has all of the right features from a memory addressability perspective from a technology tdp perspective to essentially really be right in the middle of a indiscernible class processor so from our prospective thats what we have always targeted were very very happy to say that now the chips and the fab are on track to whatever we expected to do last quarter finally i think we have always maintained that you wont see indiscernible revenue have any big impact until our fiscal  steven smigie and i assume you could talk a little bit more about pam my sense there is that there have some question marks about how big pam is going to be for a g but that as we get to  and above it has to go to pam and there is some that i think they are starting to suggest that maybe g even wont be that long of a cycle and g maybe coming more quickly than anticipated so i think that sort of sets you guys up very well that doesnt need turn out to be true and we have to turn the pam and obviously with  you would be in a strong position to really capitalize on that so i was hoping you could comment a little bit what you see as a percentage of g and pam and how quickly or maybe g could come paramesh gopi let me just make first of all good question two things when we look at pam adoption look at what drives it its basically space played ph density in a rack so rack has a fixed amount of power between  and  kilowatts it has x number of gig or gig ethernet port and so at some level that fiber and plumbing in a rack and between rack and between data centers goes in the numbers like one and four so there is no  i mean for us a gig solution is definitely viable but when we did  when we looked at it it was gig and gig those were the two things that are going to straddle the growth in this market why look at graphic statistics that cisco puts out every month i mean were getting hyper exponential growth of traffic in all of these data centers networks there is probably three to five new data centers being built every year with roughly about half a million to million servers each over a million square feet of data center right so really speaking were looking at gig solutions that are more short span and gig solutions that are more longstand and fundamentally these two things are only possible if you have gig base working with dst and the cmos analog frontend so that gives you some color on what it takes to participate in gig and gig the other big thing that i think cause the standard to go really fast was  today the pricing of a module the producability of the module are all depending on the manufacturing yield this is common sense but sometimes gets ignored more optics more problems more power less yield smaller number of lasers better yield less cost and more power so thats what this technology is going to be critical in driving into the data center in terms of size if you take the entire market to be between  million and  million that includes all the four lambda  meet   all of these different feeds and you say well what percentage of data centers will switch to it look at it option they go anywhere between  and  over the first two years as i said earlier in my comments with the standardization we can easily cut that down by factor i hope that helps steven smigie great and last question was just  i think you got a nice win there with key i believe that was on xgene and obviously were very excited about xgene but to get a xgene – can you give a little bit more color any rental wins there and for that matter on xgene as well that we see a potential contraction as customers think paramesh gopi good question we are very excited about this whole storage platform because for the first time people talked about various feed volume and this is an example of how you see an important volume marker in the arm space so there is no better proof than you going  than you looking at customers  hps and customers the likes of ups or fedex or walmart buying the stuff now youre moving this into mainstream you know this is what from a maturity perspective steve it shows what it takes to go run into a mainstream enterprise platform and were very proud because from an arm technology perspective i dont think any of the other arm vendors have had this level of success and by the way were having this success with xgene so you can imagine the potential that lies in xgene steven smigie okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of rick schafer with oppenheimer your line is now open unidentified analyst hi this is corey grady ph for rick schafer i just have one question with all your new design wins and product ramps can you talk a little bit about how we should think about incremental rd going forward paramesh gopi i think this is a good base if you look at the past two  i mean the guide for this i mean the actual results for the quarter and the quarter a good days work off of what can drive it up and down and any additional tapeups that we have that we expense and those can run into each one about  million if we have some project cost in new project introduction cost so this is  were aiming the rd spend pretty stable except for that  except for that variable that depends on our new product activity and i think that from what weve talked about the product that are going to come onboard martin mcdermut yes so i think another way to look at it is that  what will change is primarily is math ending up operator thank you operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of chris rollins with hanna ph international group your line is now open unidentified analyst hey guys congrats on a really nice quarter here so longterm you guys think maybe a year out  something like that i know the simple questions on this but how should we think about compute  should we think about this as a new steady state or a bounce back i mean it is like midteens revenue per quarter like a real number and then for connectivity is this kind of a onetime thing or is this a new steady state or could we even grow from this level as we work out like into next year i mean i think our heads are turning to spending with all those volatility in your segments so any kind of clues you could give us would be great paramesh gopi sure i think from our perspective chris we dont guide more than one quarter out but just to give you the notion of the connectivity business these new products if you really look at it we have a secured ethernet product line that is really ramping well we have huge momentum in terms of our otn and five products and weve talked about this for the last four quarters in terms of our leadership positions from a technology perspective on pam which then converted over the people doing semicustom engagements with the likes of what they would ph so we are planning for sustainability and been driving growth momentum on the connectivity business so none of  when you asked about is this a one quarter two quarter phenomenon i want to look  if you really think about it what drove this quarter is stuff that is all centered around  thats the way you want to be right on the computer side weve always thought that our pc is kind of in the structural decline weve maintained that for a long time and weve said that we would make sure that overall from a company perspective we would continue to drive connectivity and to make sure that our pc business allows us a base to transition to arm ph nothing has changed in that calculation unidentified analyst okay and i guess what we think about camp four years  so i think its like a dst and a converter on s or something does that part lie in the transceiver module itself and then also who are your biggest competitors here is it in is microsemi or are there other guys out there or do you have no competitor whatsoever and lastly what percent of your products do you sell to hyperscale guys now do you know that paramesh gopi chris first let me answer the first part of the question and i didnt quite hear the last part there was a little bit of disturbance if you can repeat it unidentified analyst sure so i asked about where this product lies is it in the transceiver module i asked who your competitors were in five microsemi or other guys and then lastly what percent of your revenue comes from hyperscale paramesh gopi okay great first is that it is the heart of the module it is the silicon that enables the optics to actually go and signals for different entities of light so it lies right smacking them number one number two you asked about who are the competitors we own the closest competitor to us its probably alago ph broadcom and then after that  were probably  months ahead of infi ph in terms of building something like this infi talked about pam i think they did a great job evangelizing it and theyve built however they built two and four laser types of  its not single laser so thats very important third you asked about hyperscale assume that people who are paying us money their entire opportunity is all about the risk nobody would pay us money for low volume optical ph and then the fourth part of it is i think  ill add to what you asked a significant portion of this comes because of very large early investments in finfet technology so we had the inside track because we called the data center guys for exchange we knew that this single laser is going to be the key to volume in this timeframe the ieee standardization just pretty much locks the whole thing up for us unidentified analyst great congrats on the quarter again paramesh gopi okay thanks chris thank you operator i would like to thank our employees for their hard work and our customers and shareholders

circuits corporation   q what are the top  innovative trends applied micro sees in esdm technology a consumerization and social media driving the electronics industry the growing use of video the explosion of internet connections and the number of connected devices spiralling bandwidth requirements and increased use of social media applications are all contributing to the rise of the cloud computing as applications become more data intensive and less compute intensive the traditional data center needs remain the same as before but the move to cloud is driving a consolidation of even traditional data centers to captive clouds this changes the technology requirements for computing servers as well as brings about a massive change in the connectivity infrastructure for example where the market took a decade to switch from g to g bandwidth on the connectivity side it has taken roughly only two years to move from g to g and it appears that g deployment may be very short lived as g solutions are already under late stage development power efficiency is not merely a green initiative any more it impacts the bottom line of businesses directly hence upfront awareness and analysis of total cost of ownership tco drives technology solutions at applied micro we see these trends as the primary engine of growth for the company by designing devices that deliver the compute performance to meet todays data center needs with dramatically lower power consumption we will dramatically lower tco q what part does india play in the overall technology strategy and marketing strategy of applied micro a appliedmicros two design centers in india play a significant role in the companys overall technology strategy as a semiconductor company our centers in pune and now in bangalore offer full design verification and validation capabilities for our computing and connectivity chips this is one of the most important aspects of getting leadingedge designs out into a competitive market if we misstep in this process we stand to offer our competitors an open door we are expanding in bangalore partially because of increased demand for our products but mostly because our design center in pune has proven that we can assemble a team of engineers to realize our state of the art products that allows us to compete globally further with several of our global  local customers having rd and systems development presence in bangalore it allows us to work closely with them to enable designin and bringup of their products with our chips q with the government of india giving complete support to the manufacturing ecosystem in terms of various policies what is the stand taken by applied micro a the government of india has been working closely with the industry and the iesa to formulate policies to give an impetus to the manufacturing ecosystem in india given the critical impact of esdm in india it would be foolhardy to ignore it at the same time we need to recognize that success in manufacturing requires a lot of things to come together  infrastructure raw materials transportation skilled labour and favourable tax policies the government has a huge role to play in influencing all of these in the end the perception about india as a manufacturing destination would need to change just like it did for software and electronic design years back applied micro is very happy to work with industry bodies like the iesa and the various governmental departments to help bring about this change as a fabless semiconductor company our core output is semiconductor and electronic design and we are expanding our operations here in india to do that as this process evolves our local presence strengthens the manufacturing ecosystem today just like the rest of our industry our products are manufactured in the far east far from where we do our designs if additional competitive options are available to us for example in india we will be happy to consider those and so would the rest of the fabless industry q what are the critical challenges facing companies looking to develop or expand existing semiconductor companies operations in india a the challenges in india are much the same as all over the world where semiconductor operations take place how do you hire the most talented engineers for your team and retain them for the longterm we feel appliedmicro was quite successful in doing so in pune and that is why we are opening up our new center in bangalore now that more and more international corporations have discovered india and its rich pool of engineering talent it has become a lot more competitive but the favorable assets that indias engineers bring to the table still make it favorable to establish roots here and compete for talent q how do you place the competency of indian product companies as compared with mncs a indias highly educated and industrious work force and positive business climate have contributed greatly to the emergence the countrys output however while india has produced great thinkers philosophers and scientists who have contributed to the progress of the whole human race product orientation has never been a focus of the people and the country in the past globalization has brought the realization about how important product focus is in todays world and businesses and entrepreneurs in india are starting to create products that the markets would accept it might take some time for successes to emerge but the education intelligence focus and persistence would pay off it always does q what would be the key market drivers in  a as a company we see a tectonic shift taking place in the computing infrastructure as we know it this is akin to the major shifts that happened earlier only perhaps much bigger we moved from mainframe based computing to department level servers and then to powerful desktop workstations then with the introduction of pcs computing came into the homes of people from being exclusively in the business offices with the internet and mobile phone it has now moved into the pockets of the masses as can been seen the edge of inclusion moved from business to the home and now to the individual it was only a matter of time that the explosion of applications like social media happened the computing infrastructure to support this explosive growth efficiently is now rapidly evolving cloud computing data centers explosive growth of video and social media applications spiralling demand for network bandwidth the drive toward lowerpower to reduce total cost of ownership are all key drivers q how do you see the indian engineering education scenario what do you think are its strengths a we see legions of highly talented engineers graduating from indian universities who come to work for us and produce worldclass results the application orientation of fresh graduates could be better but we see that the industry academia and government are aware of this and are taking steps to best address it wasnt it one of the first focus areas taken up by iesa when it was founded q how does your company plan to leverage the unique needs of india in the various market verticals a as a fabless semiconductor company applied micro creates chips in the computing and connectivity domains these chips are implemented by our customers in their systems products which are then sold and deployed all over the world including india it would not be immodest to say that we are already a critical part of indias telecom and internet backbone infrastructure through our customers products for example as we work with our customers in india we realize that they see some unique needs in india that they need to address with their systems products and several of these companies including mncs have ramped up their indian presence to define and develop these products from their development centers in india we are closely working with them to create products that will satisfy the unique needs of india q how is the regulatory environment in india impacting the indian semiconductor industry a the regulatory environment is allowing the indian semiconductor company to grow at a healthy rate from the appliedmicro perspective china is emerging as a significant player in this industry but our company keeps coming back to india to expand because we find the work force highly motivated and highly educated the regulatory environment has not caused us to alter our expansion efforts q how does applied micro connect cloud to esdm industry in india a the major growth in information technology industry is shifting from compute intensive applications to unstructured data and even more social networking based applications the cloud computing model is emerging as a result of these trends with the rapid consumerisation of computing there is a huge opportunity to create applications to address the varied needs of the individual consumers it presents a huge opportunity to both software and hardware developers in india to create solutions for the cloud market being locally present the local creators are best placed to understand the needs and define and develop these solutions not just for direct use by the consumer but also for the backbone cloud infrastructure required to support it applied micros local presence in india is critical for the same reasons the esdm industry is naturally aligned with the cloud computing model and it will thrive as the cloud becomes more pervasive in everyday use about the author dr paramesh gopi president  chief
