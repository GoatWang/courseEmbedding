encouraged with our improvement in operating expense trends increased core fee income and the high quality loan growth in the second quarter although while we recognized we have more work to do in taking on my new role within the organization we will be working toward growing shareholder value through picking up the pace of play and investing in our markets and product lines that we feel provide the greatest opportunity to create value in doing this we will balance a disciplined expense management philosophy with a strong focus on driving revenue growth to further our progress toward our goal of being the midwest premier community bank looking at the second quarter financial highlights earnings per share on both a gaap basis and after excluding significant items were up for both the first quarter of  and the second quarter of  we had strong organic loan growth totaling  million or a  annual growth rate in the second quarter critically important our credit quality remained high with our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans at a favorable  basis points at quarter end and a ratio of net charge offs to average loans at just  basis points for the quarter as i previously mentioned we are encouraged with the incremental improvements in our fundamental trends we are concentrating on further improving our operating results and laying an even greater foundation for continued growth in future quarters let me turn it over to tom shafer who will give you an overview of some of the steps we are taking to achieve that goal welcome tom tom shafer thank you david good morning everyone since taking on the role of president and ceo of chemical bank a few weeks ago ive held numerous meetings with our executive and senior leadership teams as well as many employees across the entire franchise while we have great pride in what our team has accomplished in the past we recognize and are optimistic of the future growth opportunities and our team believes there are a variety of changes we can make to further improve our core operating fundamentals and better position ourselves to take full advantage of the growth opportunities that we believe lie ahead a few days ago i had an all employee conference call announcing we have launched a project to identify those strategies which can be deployed in the short term to drive strong revenue growth in addition to steps we can take to further improve upon operating efficiency this is part of an effort to refine and clarify our overall strategic plan of how we allocate our capital across the organization and take prompt yet carefully planned steps to improve upon our positioning well be focusing on evaluating product lines to expand and enhance those that will be value additive while some product lines will see a decrease in focus we will additionally further rationalize our branch locations as the ways our customers are utilizing our services are changing at a fast pace all of this is geared towards focusing our resources on those areas that we think are most important to build shareholder value while sustaining high customer satisfaction with our relationship focused community banking delivery model i believe well be able to achieve incremental though meaningful reductions in our overall operating expenses and better position the company for continued strong revenue growth well not be providing specific guidance on the cost saves at this point due to the largest component of this exercise requires freeing up resources in order to make well informed strategic decisions on our investments within those business segments and market areas that we believe will provide strong growth opportunities when we announced our third quarter earnings in late october we expect we will be able to provide further specifics with that let me turn it over to dennis to go through the financial results in further detail dennis dennis klaeser thank you tom on slide  net income excluding significant items was  million in the second quarter of  almost twice as much as a year ago quarter and up about  million from the previous quarter diluted earnings per share excluding significant items were  per diluted share in the second quarter of  up from  in the first quarter of  and  in the second quarter of  as shown in the top of slide  yearoveryear our total loan portfolio has grown by  billion to  billion at june   the overall composition of our loan portfolio has remained relatively similar yearoveryear with about  of our loans to commercial borrowers and about  being a mix of residential and consumer loans at the end of the second quarter at the bottom of the slide youll see that our organic loan growth of  billion over the past year and the talmer acquisition added nearly  billion of loans turning to slide  we achieved  million of loan growth in the second quarter representing an annualized loan growth rate of  we are pleased with the pace of growth and expect continued strong growth for the remainder of the year commercial real estate loans have been the biggest driver of loan growth over the past two quarters but the pace of ci lending has improved and is expected to continue to improve in future quarters from slide  you can see that our  million of net loan growth for the quarter is a result of  million of growth in our originated portfolio offset by  million of runoff in our acquired loan portfolios this information is helpful for analysts and investors to understand why our provision for loan losses seems relatively high given our overall net loan growth for the analysts and investors who understand the technical accounting issues they know that for most banks when loans run off the balance sheet the income statement gets the immediate benefit from the release of loan loss reserve that was associated with those loans however for chemical bank since we account for all of our acquired loans under asc  otherwise known as purchasedcredit impaired guidance run off of acquired loans does not result in immediate benefit to our loan loss provision but rather is only realized over the longer period of time to a likely benefit to our net interest margin moving on to deposits as you can see on slide  overall organic deposit growth was compressed in the second quarter  however this compressed overall growth includes increase in customer deposits of  million compared to a year ago while letting roughly  million of broker deposits run off our balance sheet at yearend  broker deposits had fallen to just  million and it further dropped to  million ph at june   our average cost of deposits increased during the second quarter of the year to  basis points compared to  basis points in the first quarter  and  basis points in the second quarter of  the majority of the increase in cost compared to the first quarter was due to overall increases in deposit rates in our markets and the increase over the prior year was due to the inclusion of the talmer deposits looking at overall funding slide on slide  our average cost of funds ticked up to  basis points during the second quarter of  compared to  basis points in the prior quarter and  basis points one year earlier turning to slide  as david mentioned asset quality remains very high while  million of loan loss provision may seem high note the provision expense is driven by the  million in growth in our originated loan portfolio during the second quarter without there being any provision expense offset from the runoff of acquired loans net loan losses in the second quarter of  were extremely low at only  basis points of average loans our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans remain low at  basis points as of june   only  basis points up from year end  and a very substantial improvement from  basis points a year ago as shown on slide  net interest income was  million in the second quarter compared to  million in the prior quarter second quarter was impacted by an increase in interest accretion from purchase accounting discounts and acquired loans the impact of strong organic loan growth in the quarter and growth in the securities portfolio and also one additional day in the quarter versus the first quarter these increases to net interest income were partially offset by the increase in shortterm borrowings which was used to fund loan growth and the growth of our securities portfolio the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was  in the second quarter down slightly from  in the first quarter and down from  in the second quarter of  while the margin benefited from the credit quality improvement in our acquired loan portfolio through an increase in purchase accounting accretion on these loans this margin benefit was muted by the impact of the increase in the investment securities portfolio funded by an increase in shortterm borrowings the roughly  million of securities added in the second quarter should result in about  million of incremental quarterly net interest income but this portfolio averages down our net interest margin by about  basis points looking forward to the next couple of quarters i do expect continued modest pressure on our margin but much of this pressure is due to the fact that we are now originating a larger volume of variable rate commercial loans and because we expect to further incrementally increase the size of our securities portfolio moving on to noninterest income on slide  the increase in noninterest income was largely due to an increase in trust services income within wealth management and an increase in mortgage banking revenue the mortgage banking revenue was muted by  million detriment from the change in fair value of loan servicing rights as a result of high prepayment speeds in the quarter and due to the drop in interest rates the first quarter of  included  detriment to earnings due to a change in the fair value of loan servicing rates excluding the change in fair value of loan servicing rights noninterest income increased by  million in the second quarter of  compared to the first quarter as seen on slide  operating expenses excluding transaction expenses were  million in the second quarter of  compared to  million in the first quarter quarteroverquarter the decline was primarily due to a decrease of  million in salaries and wages and employee benefit expenses which was aided by a decrease in payroll taxes and an increase in deferral of loan origination costs the shift in deferral of loan origination costs was a result of the combined impact of the increase in loan production and revised loan origination costs based on the completion of an updated loan origination cost study consistent with our prior guidance as we look forward to the latter part of  and into  our goal is to keep our efficiency ratio in the low  range due to the combined impact of disciplined expense management offset by prudent investments in our infrastructure to position us for sustained growth over the longer term turning to slide  we ended the quarter with tangible book value per share of  which represents  growth in our tangible book value compared to one year ago i think this is an impressive amount of growth in tangible book value given the corporation paid  of dividends per share over the last year and absorbed the modestly dilutive impact of the tamler merger our tce to total assets ratio remains strong at  at june th and our regulatory capital ratios are strong at an estimated  for tier  capital ratio and  for our total risk based capital ratio i will now turn it back to david for some closing remarks david provost thanks dennis while we believe the economies in the markets we serve remain favorable we retain our focus of what we can control two key factors that will drive future earnings are revenue growth and disciplined expense management we are pleased with the level of high quality loans we have in our pipeline and anticipate another quarter of high quality loan growth further we will be careful to implement any cost saving directives in a manner that does not undermine our ability to grow our top line or hinder the level of quality or customers experience we continue to execute on our strategy of being midwest premier community bank we believe that our combination of market focus balance sheet strength talent and convenience provides a compelling choice to customers and businesses alike as always we appreciate your time and interest in chemical financial corporation and on that note moderator lets open the call up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and well go first to scott siefers with sandler oneill  partners scott siefers dennis first question for you just on the leverage program im hoping you can just discuss in a little more detail sort of where you think you are in it relative to completion you added nearly  million of securities in the quarter which is obviously pretty substantial but i think youre still only around a  securities to assets ratio and i think the goal is to get out closer to  or so of assets so as you think about this will the program be based on an aggregate dollar amount of purchases or a target percent of assets how are you thinking about that and where do we stand dennis klaeser yes and the  million that we added was added relatively early in the second quarter and frankly as interest rate environment changed in the second quarter we significantly slowed down the pace of adding additional securities just because the spread that we could get between our funding costs versus the yield on the securities had compressed the large target level now the environment changed a little bit as we moved into the third quarter and we have added another approximately  million or so of securities here in the third quarter but i would say the pace of expansion of the securities portfolio is going to go very slowly just given the current interest rate environment so i did indicate that my longterm target would be to have securities at roughly  of total assets but its going to take quite a few quarters to get to that point particularly given the current interest rate environment scott siefers so then so it sounds like we get to  but maybe more slowly than we thought so somewhere in the neighborhood of  you said  so somewhere between  and  million a quarter i guess is thats a fair bogey i mean wide range obviously but perhaps lower than might have originally been the intent is that correct dennis klaeser yeah as i sit here today for the third quarter i would expect only about  million or so of growth of the securities portfolio and then well revisit that in the fourth quarter and determine whether we continue at that pace or increase or decrease it scott siefers okay that makes sense and then sort of along those lines in your prepared comments you had suggested continued modest pressure on the margin over the next couple of quarters due in part to the securities portfolio when you refer to the margin are you talking about the stated margin or the core margin of  or so dennis klaeser yeah im really referring more to that core margin yeah in and of itself the securities portfolio leverage depressed our margin by about  or  basis points in the second quarter because margin on that securities portfolio leverage obviously is much lower its only about   the other factor that creates some pressure on the margin is that as we try to move the portfolio overall balance sheet to be more asset sensitive and were growing our commercial lending business more significantly than the other parts of our lending like any business that is were adding more variable rate loans which obviously have a little bit lower yield relative to the fixed rate otherwise fixed rate loans that we might be booking scott siefers and just i guess so as we look at that core margin of  about half of it half of the compression sequentially then it sounds like due to the securities portfolio that have due to those other dynamics would you anticipate the order of magnitude of compression in coming quarters being less than the  i guess in part because the securities build will perhaps be a little slower dennis klaeser yes and the other thing thats going on is that when i look back over time in the fourth quarter of last year the new loans that we were booking were roughly  basis points lower yield than the existing loan portfolio so there was given the interest rate environment there was a significant trending down of average yields on the loan portfolios that we were originating that differential has compressed very substantially and in the second quarter where its about  basis points and i see it continuing that continuing to trend down so that pressure of the new originations being lower than the existing portfolio is subsiding substantially operator and weve move to our next question from chris mcgratty with kbw chris mcgratty it seems david and dennis youre going to be in time youre going to be more proactive with managing the balance sheet and managing kind of exposures one of the things that you highlighted was the branches again i think youre conservative initially after the talmer deal understanding the seasonality in the deposits in the second quarter can you help us with kind of rationalizing the branches but also kind of keeping the loan to deposit ratio at a comfortable level thanks david provost i think that what were doing is really looking at the branch structure once again and evaluating the branches historically when we have closed a branch we have had very little migration in deposit filed with the bank so its an opportunity for us to control expenses and really not suffer too much on the deposit side chris mcgratty and maybe if i could a lot of your competitors are talking about just the desire to make acquisitions that are deposit focused im wondering if you could comment on appetite of when you guys might be ready to look at something again and then what that kind of the ideal opportunity would look like from a profile and a size geography perspective thanks david provost yes clearly i think in this environment deposit rich franchises are valuable and could add a lot of value to chemical and our guidance is similar to where it was before the odds of our pursuing a transaction this year is relatively low but we are anxious to look at acquisition opportunities and of course were going to be very cautious and prudent as to pricing and execution of acquisitions clearly were growing the franchise very well organically and we can create a lot of value there and we think that we can continue to drive very strong organic growth particularly because we have very low market share in some of our larger urban markets chris mcgratty great if i could sneak one in on the tax rate dennis can you help us with what kind of back half effective tax rate and kind of the outlook for next year thanks dennis klaeser sure so the tax rate was a little higher in the second quarter than what we had expected just due to the timing of some of the low income housing historic tax credit deals that we expect to get benefit from so in the back half of the year modeling that   is a reasonable level to use in the third quarter it should be a bit more than that however some of that benefit is going to be offset by historic tax rate deal where we have a charge related to the capital investment but that charge is more than offset by the tax benefit that we get for the quarter chris mcgratty right and that   is an effective number right dennis klaeser yes i would model that and again theres going to be a little bit of noise in terms of the timing of the historic tax credit deal whether that hits in the third quarter or fourth quarter operator well go next to terry mcevoy with stephens terry mcevoy maybe tom and i appreciate this is a new role for you and some your comments are early on but i think about the changes that youre contemplating to take advantage of growth opportunities over the short term it sounds like its more expense related connected to possibly the branch network and then longer term or mid to long term more of a revenue upside is that a safe kind of interpretation from your comments tom shafer yes i would say that actually i think that there is opportunity on both sides short term there are some expense opportunities that we have but there are some things that i think as weve you know the companies have gone through a number of mergers some revenue opportunities have been left on the table and our executive teams looking at those to move those forward near term also but generally speaking revenue especially if youre moving to new markets it takes a little longer time to develop but weve got you know its a good start on what our plans are terry mcevoy and then dennis you talked about investments in growth for the long term how much of that is called dfast and regulatory expenses now that the bank is larger versus those that hopefully will translate into revenue growth opportunities in the future dennis klaeser yes for the most part the investments and dfast and regulatory compliance and enterprise risk management and so forth is already in the run rate the incremental expenses there are  we think fairly modest in terms of the investments i think were referring to is really more investments and things are going to driving revenue and our goal is redeploying some of our resources so that when you look at our operating expenses and efficiency ratio youre not going to see that creeping up or rather maintaining that efficiency ratio in the very low  range the investments i think relate to hiring additional talent higher additional lenders particular commercial lenders in some of our markets where we think we have a lot of opportunity such as southeast michigan grand rapids and cleveland terry mcevoy and just one last question if i could for david provost the midwest to you at talmer was really michigan and ohio now that the name is different the bank is larger do you think over the next few years your geographic view of the midwest expands from where it was at talmer david provost i remember we also had a presence in wisconsin and in chicago so i think we can widen the circle out a little bit and looking at different opportunities as they present themselves operator well go next to kevin reevey with da davidson kevin reevey so dennis looks like on the consumer installment you had some very strong growth in the quarter could you talk about kind of the fico scores that are coming on and im assuming thats more on the auto side given all the  a lot of competitors are kind of exiting that market and this is creating opportunity dennis klaeser yes historically the second quarter here in michigan is a seasonally strong market for auto and we remain firmly focused just on the prime space and so the vast majority of our business  plus of it is  plus of it is fico score is  and higher and so were very cautious about that space so we did have seasonal growth in auto i think it grew to about  million of our total loan portfolio up from about  million at the end of the prior quarter but going forward i would expect that to see very modest of any growth and we study the allocation of our capital across different niches thats one area where i would expect more likely to see very little growth going forward and therefore as a percentage of our overall balance sheet that is likely to decline going forward kevin reevey and then on the ci you also had some very strong growth there were there any particular industries that stood out that contributed to the growth as well as was the growth more detroit was it grand rapids or was it more central part of michigan tom shafer yes tom shafer we had really strong growth across most of our markets the ci would be more focused in our grand rapids cleveland detroit marketplace thats where theres a larger percentage of opportunities like that but we had growth not quite as much ci and even the northern region of our company but really the urban areas are whats driving ci kevin reevey and then my last questions on the ag i know ag is a very small percentage of your loan book how will you ag borrowers fairing given where commodity prices are david provost weve got a very small percent of our portfolio in ag our credit teams are very focused on some of the performance weve got really very few cash crop exposure in the company and implemented entities are suffering but i would say that michigan where we have these well tested these are longterm relationship that we understand both the organization and their management teams so its a difficult market right now but we have a very small commitment or exposure to it operator well move next to nathan race with piper jaffray nathan race question on the just deposit growth outlook here in the third quarter can you kind of just provide an update in terms of where you guys are pricing across your footprint and just some of the competitive factors that youre seeing particularly in light of the june rate hike david provost so weve historically had very seasonal deposit flows so what happens is that in the second quarter we have deposit outflows from our municipalities just as they are utilizing the taxes that they collect in the prior quarter so third quarter that switches again where municipality deposits increase very substantially so we would expect very strong deposit growth driven by municipalities in the third quarter were trying to drive deposit growth across the entire spectrum so we did run some special campaigns in the second quarter that was cds and so were competing with the market there and clearly rates have moved up in terms of money market accounts particularly with municipalities those are also fairly rate sensitive and theyve moved up with the overall interest rate market so were seeing deposit cost pick up in line with where we see other competitors so its hard to sort of say exactly what are the incremental increases in basis points of our offering rates but it varies across the board and clearly with the growth of our ci lending and commercial lending generally were also very focused on gathering deposits from our commercial customers and those can be very attractive to us nathan race and if i could just ask one more of the reserve build this quarter is it kind of fair to expect an incremental reserve build to similar magnitude in the back half this year assuming low growth remains in the lowdouble digit range and charge offs are also in kind of seven basis point range that weve seen in the first half of this year david provost i would say so in that neighborhood theres always factors that are hard to predict but i would say roughly in the range that we were seeing but just the normal noise that youd get in there would be add plus or minus or a million and half or so is sort of the guidance range that i would suggest right now operator operator instructions well go to david long with raymond james david long i want to follow up on that comments you made about auto and its obviously a good growth in the quarter but any changes in the underlying trends there in the performance of your legacy portfolio david provost no its been very stable charge off rates are exceptionally low we have not seen any particular deterioration in credit quality david long and then my second question regarding the commercial pipeline it sounds like youve got a pretty good ci pipeline and wanted to hear maybe a little bit more color on the pipeline for commercial lenders and i know you guys have had some success in bringing over some veterans in that space any key hires in the quarter and how is the pipeline looking there going forward tom shafer this is tom your comments about our general commercials ci pipeline are accurate we expect continued momentum in that segment with our forward look at our pipeline probably the most significant hire was our regional president in southeast michigan in december from comerica hes running a very large business unit for us came and was running a large middle market team prior to joining us hes had a great start with his team here and i would say that hes looking to expand his teams in southeast michigan we also the same with our regional president in cleveland and for the most part theyre looking at regional competitors for additions to your team operator well go next to andy stapp with hilliard lyons andy stapp just wondering at the q level of salaries and benefits is a good base to start from for modeling purposes david provost i would expect it to creep up a little bit in the third quarter just due to the fact that loan production will be a little bit lower in the third and fourth quarters so just a modest uptick there however i do hope that thats more than offset by reductions in other operating expenses which was a bit higher than what we would have targeted for the quarter andy stapp and you referenced there should be  might be a charge related to the store tax credit in q just wondering how much that might be david provost i dont have the specific numbers at this point but again the charge there is more than offset by the incremental tax benefit above and beyond the guidance that i gave so while there is going to be a charge showing up in the other expenses well carefully carve that out and well identify the offsetting tax benefit that we get in the quarter andy stapp okay great and thats the last of my questions david provost and the charge is in the neighborhood of a couple million dollars  million but again rather than giving you very specific guidance on that well very carefully carve that out when we report the earnings for the quarter and thats presuming that the property actually goes into service at that in point time and theres some question as to whether its going to be third quarter or fourth quarter that that happens operator operator instructions well go to a follow up from scott siefers with sandler oneill  partners scott siefers dennis i think you might actually have answered this in the prior question but just on the aggregate expense based on sort of core way that we would look at it if youre right around  million as of the second quarter the expectation were basically flat if salaries go up but you get maybe a little relief on some of those other ones which i know i think previously were targeting back to the fourth quarter  levels so whats maybe a good proxy in your mind as we look forward dennis klaeser yeah youre correct operating expenses was a little bit higher than we had targeted and its primarily as a result of the other expenses various other

program and so in spite of maybe the size of the balance sheet not growing in aggregate not growing as rapidly as we might have thought because of the slower pace of purchases but at the margin remaining under some pressure it looks like you should still be able to grow and nii on a sequential basis is that the way youre thinking about it dennis klaeser yes with the growth  particularly in the growth of volume of the loan portfolio and incremental growth of the securities portfolio absolutely we see nii growth quarteroverquarter operator and gentlemen we have no additional questions id

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

once documents are ready well ship your final package for arrival on the second business day day trial of attorney advice speak with an independent attorney on an unlimited number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information
