of our common stock in this offering the us private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive private mortgage insurers generally compete on the basis of pricing terms and conditions underwriting guidelines loss management practices financial strength certainty of coverage reputation customer relationships service technology innovation and ease of use the private mortgage insurance industry currently consists of seven active private mortgage insurers including us and each of arch capital group ltd essent group ltd genworth financial inc mgic investment corporation nmi holdings inc and radian group inc we believe that our longstanding operating history strong and diverse customer relationships proprietary riskbased pricing framework and robust financial strength differentiate us from our competitors and have allowed us to maintain our leadership position in a competitive environment we and other private mortgage insurers also compete with federal and state governmental and quasigovernmental agencies that provide mortgage insurance including the fha and the va currently this competition is principally on the basis of price and terms in addition to competition from the fha and the va we and other private mortgage insurers face limited competition from statesponsored mortgage insurance funds in several states including california and new york from time to time other state legislatures and agencies consider expanding the authority of their state governments to insure residential mortgages we also believe that certain large bank lenders are evaluating alternative low down payment mortgage products that would not require mortgage insurance we believe such discussions are driven by recent settlements between lenders and the fha perceived buyback risk of fha loans and general fha regulatory uncertainty the introduction of such products may also have an effect on the private mortgage insurance market additionally our industry competes with products designed to eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance such as “piggyback loans” which combine a firstlien loan with a secondlien loan in order to meet the  ltv threshold required for sale to the gses without certain credit protections in addition we compete with investors willing to hold credit risk on their own balance sheets without credit enhancement frontend risk sharing structures that do not require private mortgage insurance on loans sold to the gses and in some markets with alternative forms of credit enhancement such as structured finance products and derivatives company description we are the leading private mortgage insurance company in the united states we were formed in  and have been a whollyowned subsidiary of aig since  we believe that our position as the leader in the us private mortgage insurance market reflects our longstanding operating history strong and diverse customer relationships proprietary riskbased pricing framework and robust financial strength private mortgage insurance plays a key role in the us housing finance system by protecting mortgage lenders and investors against default on a portion of the unpaid principal balance of a covered mortgage private mortgage insurers help mitigate mortgage credit risk and facilitate the sale of mortgages to fannie mae or freddie mac which we refer to as the gses and the secondary market such credit protection and secondary market sales allow lenders to increase their capacity for mortgage commitments and expand financing access to prospective homeowners we have a large and diverse customer base our longstanding presence in the private mortgage insurance market has allowed us to build customer relationships with many of the nation’s largest and highest quality lenders including national and regional mortgage banks money center banks credit unions community banks builderowned mortgage lenders and internetsourced lenders we have active relationships defined as customers who delivered new insurance written “niw” during the  months ended december   with over  customers our customer base is broadly diversified by lender size type and geography with no one customer representing more than  of our niw during the three months ended march   we have a national sales force of approximately  professionals which we believe to be one of the largest in the industry that helps drive growth in our client franchise we use a proprietary risk selection engine and pricing strategy that we believe differentiate us from our competitors following the financial crisis we developed and implemented our proprietary risk quality index “rqi” and performance premium models which draw on over a decade of historical loan and mortgage insurance data rqi utilizes over fifteen predictive variables to assess the likelihood of default on a given loan and assign a proprietary risk score we use rqi to select which loans to insure and for most new business in determining pricing on an individualized basis the rqi score for each individual loan is a core component of our performance premium riskbased pricing model under our performance premium model we have the flexibility to set and charge premium rates commensurate with the underlying risk of each loan that we underwrite we believe that our proprietary rqi and performance premium models provide us with a more granular and analytical approach to selecting and pricing risk and that this approach yields a highquality mortgage insurance portfolio and attractive riskadjusted returns we have a large and highquality book of existing inforce mortgage insurance policies with  billion of insurance in force “iif” and  billion of gross risk in force “rif” as of march   gross rif is the aggregate amount of coverage we provide on all outstanding policies at a given date without any reduction from reinsurance ceded or exposures on policies for which loss reserves have been established as of march    of our gross rif was written after  mortgages originated after  are generally perceived to be of a higher credit quality than those originated prior to the financial crisis following the financial crisis lenders have limited the availability of loans to borrowers with high fair isaac corporation credit scores “fico scores” and low ratios of debt to income who can fully document their financial position and have also sought to extend loans with lower loantovalue ratios “ltvs” as of march   our portfolio had an average fico score of  and an average ltv of  and only  of our insured policies were reported to be delinquent we believe that these characteristics show the credit quality of our gross rif and overall portfolio in addition to our primary business of writing firstlien mortgage insurance in the united states we offer loan evaluation and contract underwriting services on a selective basis and have certain insurance portfolios that are currently in runoff we use the term runoff to describe businesses in which we are no longer actively writing new policies and do not currently intend to resume such activity for the three months ended march   and the year ended december   our loan evaluation and contract underwriting services collectively accounted for less than  of our income before income tax our runoff portfolios generated  million and  million of income before income tax for the three months ended march   and the year ended december   respectively and accounted for approximately  of our gross rif as of march    united guaranty corp was formed as a delaware
