doubleline income solutions fund please access the annual report at wwwdoublelinefundscom or call  to receive a copy  investors should consider the funds investment objective risks charges and expenses carefully before investing  an investment in the fund should not constitute a complete investment program  investors should note that the fund only can be obtained through a broker there is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objectives investments in this closedend fund involve fees and expenses please refer to the prospectus for more information this document is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities nor shall there be any sale or offer of these securities in any jurisdiction where such sale or offer is not permitted fund investing involves risk principal loss is possible shares of closedend investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value which may increase investors risk of loss  this risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering  there are risks associated with investment in the fund investments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise this risk is usually greater for longerterm debt securities investments in assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk prepayment risk possible illiquidity and default as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments the fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods  these risks are greater for investments in emerging markets  investments in lower rated and nonrated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities debt securities of below investment grade quality are regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to capacity to pay interest and to repay principal and are commonly referred to as high yield securities or junk bonds  there is no assurance the funds leveraging strategies will be successful  leverage is a speculative technique that may expose the fund to greater risk and increased cost  the value of the funds

property taxes or operating costs  derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity interest rate market credit management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous  investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested  the fund may make short sales of securities which involve the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested  the fund may invest in small companies which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility the fund is a nondiversified investment company and therefore may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a limited number of issuers than funds that are diversified accordingly the fund is more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund might be past performance is no guarantee of future results past distribution history is not a projection of potential future

pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a
