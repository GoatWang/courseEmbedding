tocquevilleinsightscaveat emptor caveat emptor by paul kleinschmidt on september   buyer beware etf’s may not be what they appear exchange traded funds etf’s have been all the rage the past few years as money has flowed out of actively managed portfolios and into investment vehicles that mirror various indices after all portfolio managers rarely outperform the broader stock indices and the overwhelming majority of actively managed portfolios have underperformed their benchmarks over the past few years furthermore the difference in fees can have a meaningful impact on long term compounding of returns or so the thinking goes allegedly research analysts of today have more sophisticated systems and processes at their disposal and notwithstanding reg fd have greater access to information than even before throw in the continued proliferation of index funds to the mix and some media and famed investors have noted that a much more efficient market makes it nearly impossible for even the best money managers to offer comparable returns and less risk than the broader markets a  more likely reason in our view  is that we are in the midst of a liquidity driven market which has pushed shares of the most widely owned and largest companies higher since these are the stocks found in the most widely used indices which are weighted by market capitalization the indices may have overestimated the strength of the markets as a whole for example small capitalization names particularly on the value side have considerably lagged the indices however we believe there are signs pointing to a change in these conditions possibly setting the stage for more of a ‘stockpickers’ market maybe maybe not what is certain is that investors have flocked to etf’s in recent years pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into these vehicles in an attempt to lower management fees and mimic market or sector returns but as the wall street journal recently noted  etf investors may be in for a rude surprise when the dow jones industrial average fell more than  points on august th “dozens of etfs traded at sharp discounts to the sum of their holdings worsening losses for many fund holders who sold during the panic” in fact brand name etf’s meant to do nothing more than track major indices exhibited deeply disconcerting behavior the  billion ishares core sp  etf to name just one was down  in intraday trading while the sp  index fell only as much as  during the session while this ‘flash crash’ in etf’s didn’t last long the price action exhibited was concerning to say the least there has been plenty of speculation as to what may have caused this worrying event rule  algorithmic trading or perhaps less liquidity in the markets overall as a result of recent banking regulations no one knows for certain and there do not appear to be any fixes in the works while it’s just a hunch it certainly feels as though the last chapter to this story has yet to be written managing wealth for successive generations is tougher work than it may appear at first blush to combat the eroding forces of inflation and taxation coupled with a demand for income from an increasing number of family members as the years wear on is a distinct challenge however there are a few golden rules that are instrumental in meeting the challenges of multigenerational wealth management among them is as benjamin graham put it avoiding “really dreadful losses” sometimes those types of losses occur by taking outsized risks and sometimes they occur by buying good businesses selling at euphorically high price levels what’s clear now is that etf investors should no longer consider themselves immune from “really dreadful losses” simply because they have switched to passively managed investment vehicles again as mr graham put it “the intelligent investor realizes stocks become less risky not more as their prices fall” this we believe is something an etf will never realize using market opportunities when the “baby is thrown out with the bath water” can provide active managers with a focus on a margin of safety an opportunity to buy excellent companies that have previously been too expensive to own a key feature of long term value investing given the recent wild gyrations we believe it behooves wealth owners and their trusted advisors to question whether or not lower fees and rote investing

lp simplified compliance with laserfiche forms laserfiche solution contributed by linda schecter records retention officer tocqueville asset management tocqueville asset management lp is an sec registered investment advisor that provides portfolio management services to high networth individuals institutional clients and mutual funds as a financial services firm tocqueville has to comply with sec finra and sarbanesoxley compliance regulations among others one such regulation requires employees to report any financial transactions that they’ve performed each quarter using laserfiche forms tocqueville streamlined this process completely legacy process with over  employees the legacy quarterly transaction reports process was time consuming and paperheavy the compliance officer had to create the document and use mail merge to fill out each employee’s name on the form he would print the cover sheet and form  staple them together then hand them out individually to employees the employee signed the form and returned it by either handdelivering it to the compliance department or sending it via interoffice mail occasionally a form would be incomplete and had to be returned for revision and resubmission the compliance officer kept a manual checklist of who completed the form and who still had to turn it in laserfiche forms employees are now emailed a link to the quarterly transaction report in laserfiche forms the employee enters his three digit phone extension which is used to autopopulate information in the form from the employee database the employee fills out a quarterly transaction report in laserfiche forms the employee selects the appropriate option regarding their security transactions uploads any required documentation and applies an electronic signature before submitting the form the form cannot be submitted until all required information is entered the employee signs the form by either typing a signature or drawing it with a mouse or stylus as soon as the form is submitted it is saved into the laserfiche repository and laserfiche workflow takes over laserfiche workflow the compliance officer reviews each form and changes the status in the laserfiche metadata to either approved or rejected if the form is rejected the submitter is notified by email and has to resubmit the form laserfiche workflow then removes the first submission and replaces it with the new submission approved forms are stored in the employee’s folder approved quarterly transaction reports are saved in the employee’s laserfiche folder shortcuts to the specific folder with the report are created in the quarterly transaction report folder for easier viewing by the compliance officer the compliance officer can view all quarterly transaction reports through the use of shortcuts laserfiche workflow sends three emails to the compliance department when they request them a list of all employees who haven’t submitted a form this report is generated by compiling a list of all employees who submitted the form based on information stored in the form’s metadata against a list of all active employees pulled from an employee database a list of forms that have been submitted and need review this report is created by compiling a list of all submitted forms with a pending review status a list of all submitted forms and their status
