   includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business combination  a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans and advances from one of our sponsors apple orange llc of  as described in this prospectus these loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering  the underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to  of the gross proceeds of this offering upon completion of our initial business combination up to  which constitutes the underwriter’s deferred commissions or up to  if the underwriter’s overallotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the underwriter from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital the underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses the amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account based on the current interest rate environment we would expect approximately  to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over  months following the closing of this offering however we can provide no assurances regarding this amount this estimate assumes an interest rate of  per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested  includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for financing this amount does not include any investment banking fees which may be payable upon consummation of a business combination macquarie capital has not yet been retained for a specific financial advisory underwriting capital raising or other transaction and so we are not able to quantify the fees for any such engagement no funds will be paid out of the trust to fund any such fee payments and it is not expected that any fees would be paid prior to the consummation of a business combination the actual amount of fees received will vary significantly based on the size of any transaction and the extent to which other investment banks are involved  in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsors their respective affiliates or designees have committed  each for an aggregate of  to be provided to us to fund our expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital requirements after this offering and prior to our initial business combination the rules of the nasdaq capital market provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants approximately  or approximately  if the underwriter’s overallotment option is exercised in full including up to  or up to  if the underwriter’s overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account located in the united states and held at jpmorgan chase bank na with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations based upon current interest rates we expect the trust account to generate approximately  of interest during the next  months we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes and to fund working capital requirements until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or the redemption of  of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to the requirements of law based on current interest rates we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsors members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we have entered into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which we will pay terrapin partners llc an affiliate of our terrapin sponsor a total of  per month for office space utilities and secretarial support upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees prior to the closing of this offering apple orange llc one of our sponsors has loaned and advanced us  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the earlier of september   or the closing of this offering in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsors their respective affiliates or designees have committed  each for an aggregate of  to be provided to us in the event that funds held outside of the trust are insufficient to fund our expenses relating to investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital requirements after this offering and prior to our initial business combination and may but are not obligated to loan us additional funds to fund our expenses relating to investigating and completing our initial business combination if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the initial stockholders mihi llc one of our sponsors and a subsidiary of macquarie group limited or macquarie asx mqg has agreed to enter into a contingent forward purchase contract with us to purchase in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately  to occur concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination  of our units on substantially the same terms as the sale of units in this offering at  per unit and  shares of class f common stock on the same terms as the sale of shares of class f common stock to our sponsors prior to this offering the funds from the sale of units will be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination any excess funds from this private placement of units will be used for working capital in the posttransaction company this commitment is independent of the percentage of stockholders electing to redeem their shares and provides us with a minimum funding level for the initial business combination the contingent forward purchase contract is contingent upon among other things our macquarie sponsor approving the business combination which approval can be withheld for any reason in addition we have granted macquarie capital usa inc a right of first refusal for a period of  months from the closing of this offering to provide certain financial advisory underwriting capital raising and other services for which they may receive fees if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsors directors officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of our completion of an initial business combination and then only in connection with those shares of our class a common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein or the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our sponsors or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with any potential business combination target we intend to focus our efforts on seeking an initial business combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between  million and  billion although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered following the initial business combination our objective will be to implement or support the acquired company’s operating strategies in order to generate additional value for shareholders general goals may include additional acquisitions and operational improvements our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry we believe that private equity firms and others will find the opportunity to enter into the initial business combination with us attractive for the following reasons  track record of our management team nathan leight has served as chairman of two previous blank check companies that completed successful business combinations mr leight served as chairman of aldabra acquisition corporation or aldabra  which completed a merger with affiliates of and into great lakes dredge  dock corporation or gldd nasdaq gldd in  mr leight later served as chairman and mr arora and mr barudin served as key members of the management team of aldabra  acquisition corp or aldabra  which completed a merger in  with certain paper and packaging businesses of boise cascade company the resulting company was subsequently listed on the new york stock exchange as boise inc or boise mr leight has been on the board of gldd since  and has served as chairman of gldd since  he served as a member of the board of directors of boise for five years following the merger with aldabra  both gldd and boise assets were owned by private equity investors prior to these transactions we believe private equity firms will view the consummation of the aldabra  and aldabra  mergers and the subsequent management of those companies as positive factors in considering whether to sell a portfolio company to us  minimum funding available as a result of the  million mihi llc private placement our macquarie sponsor has agreed to enter into a contingent forward purchase contract with us to purchase in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately  to occur concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination  of our units on substantially the same terms as the sale of
