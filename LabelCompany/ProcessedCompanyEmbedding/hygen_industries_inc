to ask what energy source do you use to extract hydrogen from water the most straight forward method would be electrolysis but the electricity for electrolysis has to come from somewhere and that somewhere is likely fossil fuels because electrolysis is not  efficient you lose energy when converting fossilfuelderived electricity to hydrogen because hydrogen fuel cells are not  efficient you lose more energy when you convert the hydrogen back to electricity to drive a vehicle with the ultimate source of hydrogen power leading back to fossil fuel and the inevitable energy losses to inefficiency how is this a solution see morelike · comment · shareeddie goodwinjuly  at amthe future as i see it like · comment · shareenglish us · español · português brasil · français france ·

seeks funds under regulation a rules on startengine tweet share share  reddit pin emailshares  may     am by samantha hurst hygen industries inc a californiabased company that supplies clean renewable hydrogen for fuel cell electric vehicles announced on friday it launched a crowdfunding offering on startengine to raise funds under regulation a tier  the company reported that this offering news comes just after it awarded  million from the california energy commission to build clean renewable hydrogen fueling stations according to the company its zeroemission stations will service the new lineup of fuel cell electric vehicles fcevs from forwardlooking companies such as toyota hyundai honda and other manufacturers its clean and renewable production method notably involves purchasing renewable electricity and create hydrogen through water electrolysis which is described as a process that uses electrolyzers at partner gas stations hygen industries revealed “renewable energy is intermittent clean energy companies often generate more power than they can sell to the grid and storage of this excess electricity has not traditionally been feasible at scale hygen takes that energy stores it as hydrogen and adds value selling the stored energy hydrogen as a transportation fuel in hygen’s model renewable energy companies will be able to sell their excess energy to power cars marginal renewable energy projects become viable increasing the renewable portfolio” speaking about the public offering paul dillon cfo of hygen industries stated “hygen is excited to offer the public an opportunity to invest in a carbonfree alternative to fossil fuels for transportation we firmly believe that the jobs act provides an ideal opportunity for small investors to become stakeholders in companies generating a positive impact our offering allows millions across the us and the world the chance to vote with their pocketbook for cleaner transportation” the company went on to add that beginning this year it plans to deploy the latest generation hydrogen production systems at locations throughout california the startengine campaign is set to close later this summer  have a
