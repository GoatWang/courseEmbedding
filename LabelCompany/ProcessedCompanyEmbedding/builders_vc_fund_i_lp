a new fund called builders posted dec   by connie loizos cookie  shares next story yahoo answers makes its official mobile debut jim kim who most recently cofounded the venture firm formation  is launching a brandnew venture firm called builders that looks to be raising a  million fund judging by a recent sec filing his cofounder is paul lee who left the chicago venture firm lightbank in  and last year launched a startup studio called roniin that we wrote about last year it isn’t a surprise to see kim starting something new after a tumultuous  formation  had decided against raising a third fund we wondered whether builders meant that lee was similarly moving on from roniin however so we recently caught up with both men to ask that question as well as ask how they came together and what builders — which already has an office in both san francisco and chicago — plans to do differently than the hundreds of other venture firms up and running we also asked about the pair’s fundraising progress but they declined to comment citing sec regulations more from that conversation follows tc how well do you two know each other when did you meet pl we go back  years we both started our careers at ge capital jim was building up its it practice i was building up its media practice but we spent time talking about deals we’d get drinks we’ve probably talked monthly ever since then we did go off and build our own platforms jim built formation  i ran lightbank but he was my first call in helping shape roniin and he was the first investor in the platform and in five of the companies that have come out of the platform since tc roniin’s big idea was to take the ideas of overly busy entrepreneurs find firsttime founders to bring them to life then give both a big chunk of the new company — along with a little seed capital from roniin what happens to it now that you’re starting a new fund pl it’s being rebranded as builder studios and it will be working with the startups that we fund the  million seed round it raised was used to prove out the concept and it worked we learned how to run that pl and run that infrastructure without a massive amount of burn now we want to use that team of experts we’ve assembled including engineers sales personnel marketers and back office operations employees to support our portfolio companies tc so you’re creating more of a platform for your new fund and will the people at the studio get equity in these startups how does compensation work across the fund and the studio jk we aren’t commenting publicly on that right now but when you look at the data one out of every three seedfunded companies was able to raise a series a round a few years ago now that percentage is much smaller so there’s this opportunity to help an entrepreneur who has a good technical team to find productmarket fit and help give them multiple shots on the goal we aren’t talking about pr or hr we think instead startups can benefit greatly from working alongside this studio and accessing this group of operators to improve everything from their uiux to product development tc how much money will you be plugging into your portfolio companies jk we want to write  million to  million checks and accelerate the companies for their next round of funding tc are you focusing on particular sectors pl we believe as an earlystage fund you can’t be too sectorspecific instead we’re thesis driven meaning we’re not looking purely for science experiments but rather the application of fantastic technologies in antiquated markets combined with ruthless execution by founders paroio which invites customers to outsource their finance departments and that received seed funding from roniin is one example it leverages the same blueprint officeluv an office cleaning and management service is another we especially like companies that are small and mediumsize business oriented tc that doesn’t sound so unlike what other vc firms are looking for but you’re arguing that this studio is your core competitive advantage jk traditionally seedfunded companies will work on a product for six months then they’ll feel that they have to start selling so they’ll hire a vp of sales who it takes three months to find and another three months to train it’s at least a year before you’re talking with customers and hearing if you’re addressing a customer pain point and if you aren’t you raise an extension found with builders from day one we’re getting sales and marketing people involved with the founder to go after a vertical or a geography and to start talking with customers if you can build features earlier and iterate multiple times and run these projects every two to three months you’re going to find customer pain points a lot earlier and you’re going to have more shots at series a funding  shares advertisement advertisement crunchbase builders founded  overview builders believes it takes more than great technology to fix an antiquated
