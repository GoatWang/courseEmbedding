forwardlooking statements regarding us our business prospects and results of operations that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties posed by many factors and events that could cause our actual business prospects and results of operations to differ materially from those that may be anticipated by such forwardlooking statements factors that may affect such forwardlooking statements include without limitation our ability to successfully develop new products and services for new markets the impact of competition on our revenues changes in law or regulatory requirements that adversely affect or preclude clients from using us for certain applications delays our introduction of new products or services and our failure to keep pace with our competitors when used in this discussion words such as believes anticipates expects intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying forwardlooking statements readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this report we undertake no obligation to revise any forwardlooking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business   part i item  description of business narrative description of the business  we plan to make early stage investments that will bring alternative energy technologies to commercialization and then actively manage these investments we plan to generate management fees based on the size of the investments that we oversee and incentive income based on the performance of these investments   our principal business has been to provide consulting to related parties with respect to their investments in alternative energy projects as to our investments we will not limit ourselves to any single area of alternative energy we will look at any and all forms of alternative energy we actively screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with potential for long term success operations in the past we have acted as a consultant to with respect to client investments in alternative energy projects we performed due diligence and ongoing research and evaluation with respect to projects on a fee basis we are not currently generating revenues as a consultant we also plan to seek develop and manage alternative energy investments for our own account we screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with long term potential we do not limit ourselves to any single area of alternative energy we will look at any and all forms of alternative energy we have a proprietary investment screening process to make our investments  this process is based upon the experience of mr brian klemsz our president and outside consultants as we develop our company   for the fiscal years ended  and  we have not been profitable while we have lost our only source of revenue we have been pursuing new clients to replace the lost revenue stream and are also exploring the possibility of merging with an existing company who has revenues and potentially earnings at this time we have no definitive arrangements for either replacing our lost revenue or identifying a merger candidate we operate out of one office in colorado we have no specific plans at this point for additional offices                we operate out of one office in colorado we have no specific plans at this point for additional offices       markets we believe that the primary reason that clients would procure services from us rather than competitors would be the existing relationships that we possess and can develop we believe that client loyalty and satisfaction can be the basis for success in this business therefore we plan to develop and expand on already existing relationships to develop a competitive edge we utilize the expertise of our principal officer to market our proprietary investment screening process business     raw materials           the use of raw materials is not a  factor in our operations at the present time the use of raw materials may become a material factor in the future as we develop operations customers and competition our business plan involves acting as both a consultant and an investor in alternative energy technologies this business is highly competitive there are numerous similar companies providing such services in the united states of america our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business our ability to develop our business will depend on our ability to successfully identify alternative energy technology investments in this highly competitive environment we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully   over the past several years the size and number of funds that focus on alternative energy technologies has continued to increase if this trend continues it is possible that it will become increasingly difficult for us to raise funds to grow our company competition is based on a variety of factors including      •  investment performance   •  investor perception of investment managers’ drive focus and alignment of interest   •  quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors   •  business reputation and   •  level of fees and expenses charged for services              we compete with a large number of management firms and other financial institutions a number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks     •  investors may develop concerns that we will allow a business to grow to the detriment of its performance   •  some of our competitors have greater capital lower targeted returns or greater sector or investment strategy specific expertise than we do which creates competitive disadvantages with respect to investment opportunities some of our competitors may perceive risk differently than we do which could allow them either to outbid us for investments in particular sectors or generally to consider a wider variety of investments     •  there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new private equity and hedge fund management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business including former ‘‘star’’ portfolio managers at large diversified financial institutions as well as such institutions themselves will continue to result in increased competition and   •  other industry participants could  seek to recruit our best and brightest investment professionals away from us     these and other factors could reduce our earnings and revenues and materially adversely affect our business employees           we have one fulltime employee mr klemsz mr klemsz does not draw a salary or receive any other kind of compensation however we reimburse our employee for all necessary and customary business related expenses  we have no plans or agreements which provide health care insurance or compensation on the event of termination of employment or change in our control  we do not pay our directors separately for any board meeting they attend   proprietary information                 we have a proprietary investment screening process to make our investments  otherwise we own no proprietary information government regulation at some point we may be required to file to become a registered investment advisor but we currently do not expect government regulations or environmental laws to have any material impact on us research and development we have never spent any amount in research and development activities      environmental compliance we believe that we are not subject to any material costs for compliance with any environmental laws   how to obtain our sec filings   we file annual quarterly and special reports proxy statements and other information with the securities exchange commission sec reports proxy statements and other information filed with the sec can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities of the sec at  f street ne washington dc  such material may also be accessed electronically by means of the secs website at wwwsecgov  our investor relations department can be contacted at our principal executive office located at our principal office a e harmony road  fort collins colorado   our telephone number is   we do not have a corporate website a  risk factors           you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this prospectus before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock             the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result in this case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment risks related to our business and industry while we were profitable for the four fiscal years prior to  we have not been profitable for the subsequent fiscal years  we have lost our only client and we may never be profitable again  if we cannot develop revenue we could go out of business we were formed as a colorado business entity in november  for four fiscal years prior to  our operations were profitable  however we have lost our only client and have not been able to replace the revenue in the subsequent fiscal years we cannot guarantee that we will be profitable again if we cannot develop revenue  we could go out of business currently we believe that we have sufficient capital to sustain our business operations through march   we have relied upon one client for all of our revenues which means that the loss of this client has severely impacted our operations if we cannot replace the lost revenue or merge with a company we could go out of business one client in fiscal year  accounted for  of our revenues this client was a related party eastmountain alternative energy llc eastmountain alternative energy llc gave notice to us that effective december   it planned to terminate the asset management services contract it had with us  we have been and could continue to be materially impacted by the loss of this client the loss of this one client makes us subject to uncertain revenue results with the termination of the asset management services contract between us and eastmountain alternative energy llc we no longer provide asset management services to any clients and have no current revenue source going forward while we have lost our only source of revenue we have been seeking additional clients to replace our lost revenue although we have no definite arrangements at this point in the alternative we may seek a merger candidate although we have not identified any definitive acquisitions at this time we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace our lost revenue or to identify a merger candidate if we cannot either replace our lost revenue or identify a merger candidate we may eventually cease business an investor could lose his entire investment our lack of operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance an investor could lose his entire investment we have a limited operating history an investor has no frame of reference to evaluate our future business prospects  this makes it difficult if not impossible to evaluate us as an investment an investor could lose his entire investment if our future business prospects do not result in our sustaining our current profitability              if we do not generate adequate revenues to finance our operations our business may fail              we began generating revenues in  as of december   we had a cash position of  and an additional  in certificates of deposit our operating costs for the fiscal year ended december   were  these operating costs include insurance taxes utilities maintenance contract services and all other costs of operations we will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated however the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict since there can be no assurances that revenues will be sufficient to cover operating costs for the foreseeable future it may be necessary to raise additional funds due to our lack of consistent profitable operating history raising additional funds may be difficult competition in the alternative energy industry is intense   our business plan involves acting as a consultant and making investments in alternative energy projects this business is highly competitive there are numerous similar companies seeking such investments in the united states of america our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business our ability to develop our business will depend on our ability to successfully develop investments in this highly competitive environment we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully the share control position of westmountain green llc will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate actions                our largest shareholder westmountain green llc of which mr klemsz is a  member owns  shares and thereby controls approximately  of our outstanding shares because westmountain green llc individually beneficially controls more than a majority of the outstanding shares other shareholders individually or as a group will be limited in their ability to effectively influence the election or removal of our directors the supervision and management of our business or a change in control of or sale of our company even if they believed such changes were in the best interest of our shareholders   our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our president and treasurer and the continued financing of westmountain green llc                we depend almost entirely on the efforts and continued employment of mr klemsz our president and treasurer mr klemsz is our primary executive officer and we will depend on him for nearly all aspects of our operations in addition westmountain green llc is our only source of external financing we do not have an employment contract with mr klemsz and we do not carry key person insurance on his life the loss of the services of mr klemsz through incapacity or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our business it would be very difficult to find and retain qualified personnel such as mr klemsz and a financing source to replace westmountain green llc  at the present time there is no contractual commitment for westmountain green llc to fund us our revenue and profitability fluctuate particularly inasmuch as we cannot predict the timing of realization events in developing future investments which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause volatility in the price of our shares we may experience significant variations in revenues and profitability during the year based upon potential future equity investments we may develop  if we engage in future equity investments the timing and receipt of income generated by bringing new alternative energy projects to market is event driven and thus highly variable which contributes to the volatility of our revenue and our ability to realize incentive income from our potential funds may be limited we cannot predict when or if any realization of any potential investments will occur if we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter it may have a significant impact on our revenues and profits for that particular quarter which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters in addition our potential equity investments would be adjusted for accounting purposes to fair value at the end of each quarter resulting in revenue attributable to our potential principal investments even though we would receive no cash distributions from our equity funds which could increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings we have no such equity investments at this time                  difficult market conditions can adversely affect our funds in many ways including reducing the value or performance of the investments we make in our investments and reducing the ability of our company to raise or deploy capital which could materially reduce our revenue and results of operations if economic conditions are unfavorable our projects may not perform well and we may not be able to raise money in existing or new projects our investments will be materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world the global market and economic climate may deteriorate because of many factors beyond our control including rising interest rates or inflation terrorism or political uncertainty in the event of a market downturn our businesses could be affected in different ways a general market downturn or a specific market dislocation may cause our revenue and results of operations to decline by causing      • the value of our investments to decrease   • lower investment returns reducing incentive income and   • material reductions in the value of our ownership in investments   furthermore while difficult market conditions may increase opportunities to make certain alternative energy investments such conditions also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by us with debt investments the success of our business depends in part upon proprietary technologies and information which may be difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we believe that the identification acquisition and development of proprietary technologies are key drivers of our business our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents license the patents of others maintain the secrecy of our proprietary technology and information and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we currently do not license any patents we cannot assure you that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business that the patents that we license will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties that we will acquire additional proprietary technology that is patentable or that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties further we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop similar or superior technologies duplicate elements of any technology we may own or design around it in order to successfully commercialize any proprietary technologies it is possible that we may need to acquire licenses to or to contest the validity of issued or pending patents or claims of third parties we cannot assure you that any license acquired under such patents would be made available to us on acceptable terms if at all or that we would prevail in any such contest in addition we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us for alleged infringement of another party’s patents or in defending the validity or enforceability of our patents or in bringing patent infringement suits against other parties based on our patents in addition to the protection afforded by patents we may also rely on trade secrets proprietary knowhow and technology that we seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with our prospective joint venture partners employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others            because we are smaller and have fewer financial and other resources than many alternative energy companies we may not be able to successfully compete in the very competitive alternative energy industry alternative energy functions as a commodity there is significant competition among existing alternative energy producers our business could face competition from a number of producers that can produce significantly greater volumes of alternative energy than we can or expect to produce producers that can produce a wider range of products than we can and producers that have the financial and other resources that would enable them to expand their production rapidly if they chose to these producers may be able to achieve substantial economies of scale and scope thereby substantially reducing their fixed production costs and their marginal productions costs if these producers are able to substantially reduce their marginal production costs the market price of alternative energy products may decline and we may not be able to produce alternative energy products at a cost that allows us to operate profitably even if we are able to operate profitably these other producers may be substantially more profitable than us which may make it more difficult for us to raise any financing necessary for us to achieve our business plan and may have a materially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock increased alternative energy production in the united states could increase the demand for feedstocks and the resulting price of feedstocks reducing our profitability new alternative energy   projects are under construction throughout the united states increased production from alternative energy sources could increase feedstock demand and prices resulting in higher production costs and lower profits   price increases or interruptions in needed energy supplies could cause loss of customers and impair our profitability   alternative energy production requires a constant and consistent supply of energy if there is any interruption in our supply of energy for whatever reason such as availability delivery or mechanical problems we may be required to halt production if we halt production for any extended period of time it will have a material adverse effect on our business natural gas and electricity prices have historically fluctuated significantly we expect to purchase significant amounts of these resources as part of our alternative energy production increases in the price of natural gas or electricity would harm our business and financial results by increasing our energy costs   risks related to government regulation and subsidization the united states alternative energy industry is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in that legislation or regulation could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the elimination or significant reduction in the federal tax incentive could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   the production of alternative energy has historically been related to federal tax incentives the elimination or significant reduction in the federal tax incentives on any or all alternative energy projects could negatively impact or proposed operations                lax enforcement of environmental and energy policy regulations may adversely affect the demand for alternative energy products   our success will depend in part on effective enforcement of existing environmental and energy policy regulations many of our potential customers are unlikely to switch from the use of conventional fuels unless compliance with applicable regulatory requirements leads directly or indirectly to the use of alternative energy both additional regulation and enforcement of such regulatory provisions are likely to be vigorously opposed by the entities affected by such requirements if existing emissionsreducing standards are weakened or if governments are not active and effective in enforcing such standards our business and results of operations could be adversely affected even if the current trend toward more stringent emissions standards continues our future prospects will depend on the ability of alternative energy to satisfy these emissions standards more efficiently than other existing technologies certain standards imposed by regulatory programs may limit or preclude the use of our products to comply with environmental or energy requirements any decrease in the emission standards or the failure to enforce existing emission standards and other regulations could result in a reduced demand for alternative energy products a significant decrease in the demand for alternative energy products will reduce the price of such products adversely affect our profitability and decrease the value of your stock   costs of compliance with burdensome or changing environmental and operational safety regulations could cause our focus to be diverted away from our business and our results of operations to suffer   we expect to be subject to complicated environmental regulations of the us environmental protection agency and regulations and permitting requirements of the various states with respect to our alternative energy projects these regulations are subject to change and such changes may require additional capital expenditures or increased operating costs consequently considerable resources may be required to comply with future environmental regulations we do not currently expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in this or the succeeding fiscal year in addition our proposed projects could be subject to environmental nuisance or related claims by employees property owners or residents near our projects arising from air or water discharges environmental and public nuisance claims or tort claims based on emissions or increased environmental compliance costs could significantly increase our operating costs   any new alternative energy plants will be subject to federal and state laws regarding occupational safety risks of substantial compliance costs and liabilities are inherent in alternative energy production we may be subject to costs and liabilities related to worker safety and job related injuries some of which may be significant possible future developments including stricter safety laws for workers and other individuals regulations and enforcement policies and claims for personal or property damages resulting from operation of our projects could reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be available to further enhance our business   risks related to an investment in our common stock   the lack of a broker or dealer to create or maintain a market in our stock could adversely impact the price and liquidity of our securities         we have no agreement with any broker or dealer to act as a market maker for our securities and there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any market makers thus no broker or dealer will have an incentive to make a market for our stock the lack of a market maker for our securities could adversely influence the market for and price of our securities as well as your ability to dispose of or to obtain accurate information about andor quotations as to the price of our securities we have limited experience as a public company   we have only operated as a public company since january  we trade on a limited basis on the otc bulletin board under the trading symbol wetm thus we have limited experience in complying with the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to operate successfully as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us              we may be required to register under the investment company act of  or the investment advisors act which could increase the regulatory burden on us and could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities because our proposed business involves in part the identification acquisition and development of alternative energy investments we may be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment advisors act and analogous state law while we believe that we are currently either not an investment company or an investment advisor or are exempt from registration as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment advisors act and analogous state law either the sec or state regulators or both may disagree and could require registration either immediately or at some point in the future as a result there could be an increased regulatory burden on us which could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities we may be impacted by new regulatory requirements as a result of the passage of the doddfrank act in july  congress enacted the doddfrank act which instituted major changes in the regulatory regime for public companies particularly those in the financial sector at the present time we do not believe that we will be impacted in a material way by this legislation however the implementation of the provisions of the doddfrank act are subject to regulations which have not yet been written and its statutory provisions have not been the subject of extensive judicial review so we cannot guarantee that we may not come under its purview at some point in the future and be affected negatively by it our stock has a limited public trading market and there is no guarantee a trading market will ever develop for our securities there has been and continues to be a limited public market for our common stock an active trading market for our shares has not and may never develop or be sustained if you purchase shares of common stock you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the initial price you paid the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including the following      actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results      changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates      changes in market valuations of other companies particularly those that market services such as ours      announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments      introduction of product enhancements that reduce the need for the products our projects may develop      departures of key personnel   of our total outstanding shares as of december   a total of  or approximately  are restricted from immediate resale but are potentially available to be sold into the market under rule  this could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly even if our business is doing well         as restrictions on resale end the market price of our stock could drop significantly if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them                applicable sec rules governing the trading of penny stocks limit the liquidity of our common stock which may affect the trading price of our common stock our common stock currently trades from time to time and always below  per share as a result our common stock is considered a penny stock and is subject to sec rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our shares can be publicly traded  these regulations require the delivery prior to any transaction involving a penny stock of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock and the associated risks  under these regulations certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the written purchasers agreement to a transaction prior to purchase  these regulations have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock the overthecounter market for stock such as ours is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations the securities of companies such as ours have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations during certain periods these broad market fluctuations and other factors such as new product developments and trends in the our industry and in the investment markets generally as well as economic conditions and quarterly variations in our operational results may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock buying lowpriced penny stocks is very risky and speculative our common shares are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  exclusive of the value of principal residence or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a brokerdealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement prior to the sale in addition the brokerdealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in the public markets issuances of our stock could dilute current shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock if an active public trading market develops we have the authority to issue up to  shares of common stock  shares of preferred stock and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval although no financing is planned currently we may need to raise additional capital to fund operating losses if we raise funds by issuing equity securities our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution in addition we could issue large blocks of our common stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further stockholder approval the issuance of preferred stock by our board of directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock an issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could upon conversion or otherwise have all of the rights of our common stock our board of directors authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger tender offer proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve              colorado law and our articles of incorporation protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits which could make it difficult for us to recover damages from them in the event of a lawsuit          colorado law provides that our directors will not be liable to our company or to our stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors our articles of incorporation require us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law the exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence poor judgment or other circumstances the indemnification provisions may require our company to use our assets to defend our directors and officers against claims including claims arising out of their negligence poor judgment or other circumstances we do not expect to pay dividends on common stock we have not paid any cash dividends with respect to our common stock and it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future earnings if any that we may realize will be retained in the business for further development and expansion     item  description of property our principal executive offices are located at a e harmony road  fort collins colorado  and our telephone number is     we do not own or lease any real estate  we do not have any plans to acquire or lease any real estate     item  legal proceedings we are not a party to any material legal proceedings nor is our property the subject of any material legal proceeding   item  mine safety disclosures not applicable to smaller reporting companies part ii item  market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities   holders as of march    there were fifty five record holders of our common stock and there were  shares of our common stock outstanding market information a limited public market currently exists for shares of our common stock we began trading on the overthecounter bulletin board under the trading symbol wetm in january                the following table sets forth the high and low closing bid prices of our common stock on for the periods indicated in  and      closing bid price      high     low   first quarter             second quarter             third quarter             fourth quarter                 closing bid price      high     low   first quarter             second quarter             third quarter             fourth quarter             on march   the closing bid price of our common stock in the otc bulletin board was  per share and we had no trading volume that day   the securities enforcement and penny stock reform act of  the securities and exchange commission has also adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system   a purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock our shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future the classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a brokerdealer to sell the stock into a secondary market which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate hisher investment any brokerdealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to rules g through g of the securities and exchange act rather than creating a need to comply with those rules some brokerdealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the commission which     • contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading   • contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of the securities act of  as amended     • contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price   • contains a tollfree telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions   • defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks and     • contains such other information and is in such form including language type size and format as the securities and exchange commission shall require by rule or regulation                          the brokerdealer also must provide prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock to the customer     • the bid and offer quotations for the penny stock   • the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction   • the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and     •  monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account             in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement these disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their securities equity compensation plan information

believe that we must generate approximately  in revenue per year however if our forecasts are inaccurate we will need to raise additional funds in addition we expect that we will need to raise additional funds if we decide to pursue more rapid expansion the development of new or enhanced services or products appropriate responses to competitive pressures or the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies or if we must respond to unanticipated events that require us to make additional investments we cannot assure that additional financing will be available when needed on

commission the sec for quarterly reports on form q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles these financial statements and notes herein are unaudited but in the opinion of management include all the adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the companys audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the companys form k for the year ended december   as filed with the sec interim operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for any future interim period or for the full year cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents   income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse in evaluating the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized management establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be utilized the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income which must occur prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carry forwards as of march   and december   the

asu no  did not have an impact on our financial statements  in november  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes this update requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within a classified statement of financial position asu  is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods therein beginning after december   this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented early application is permitted as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period we adopted asu  in the first quarter of  the adoption of asu  did not have an impact on our financial statements         westmountain alternative energy inc notes to the condensed financial statements unaudited   in may  the fasb issued asu  revenue from contracts with customers topic  which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance this standard introduces a new fivestep revenue recognition model in which an entity should   recognize revenue the new standard requires that a company recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services companies will need to use more judgment and estimates than under the guidance currently in effect including estimating the amount of variable revenue to recognize over each identified performance obligation additional disclosures will be required to help users of financial statements understand the nature amount and timing of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts this standard will become effective for westmountain alternative energy inc beginning with the first quarter  and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption currently the company has not recorded any revenue as such we do not expect this asu to impact our financial reporting should we have revenue we will review and disclose the expected impact at that time    related parties   the

projections about our industry management beliefs and certain assumptions made by our management  words such as anticipates expects intends plans believes seeks estimates variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements  these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any such forwardlooking statements  unless required by law we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise   however readers should carefully review the risk factors set forth herein and in other reports and documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission particularly annual reports on form k quarterly reports on form q and any current reports on form k   general   we plan to make early stage investments that will bring alternative energy technologies to commercialization and then actively manage these investments historically we have acted as a consultant with respect to client investments in alternative energy projects we performed due diligence and ongoing research and evaluation with respect to projects on a fee basis we are not currently generating revenues as a consultant eastmountain alternative energy llc a related party gave notice that effective december   it would terminate the asset management services contract it had with us  with the termination of the asset management services contract between us and eastmountain alternative energy llc we no longer provide asset management services to any clients and have no current revenue source going forward while we lost our only current source of revenue we are pursuing new clients to replace the lost revenue stream and also exploring the possibility of merging with an existing company who has revenues and potentially earnings at this time we have no definitive arrangements for either replacing our lost revenue or identifying a merger candidate               as to our investments we will not limit ourselves to any single area of alternative energy we will look at any and all forms of alternative energy we actively screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with potential for long term success our principal executive offices are located at a e harmony road  fort collins colorado  we have no specific plans at this point for additional offices   we have not been subject to any bankruptcy receivership or similar proceeding     results of operations   the following discussion involves our results of operations for the three months ended march   and  we had revenues of  for the three months ended march   and  respectively operating expenses consisting primarily of selling general and administrative costs were  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the three months ended march   most of the costs were attributable to professional and contract services we do not anticipate these professional fees or contract services to increase significantly in the near future we had a net loss of  for the three months ended march   compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended march   liquidity and capital resources our cash on march   was   we had an additional amount of  in certificates of deposit we anticipate that operating costs will range between  and  for the fiscal year ending december   these operating costs include insurance taxes utilities maintenance contract services and all other costs of operations we will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated however the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict we will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated cash flows used in operating activities were  for the three months ended march   compared to cash flows used in operating activities of  for the three months ended march   we had revenues of  for the three months ended march   and  in march  the company paid annual fees of  to otc markets that was posted as a prepaid expense and was offset by  amortization expense to contract services on the income statement   cash flows provided by investing activities were  for the three months ended march   and  respectively cash flows provided by financing activities were  for the three months ended march   and   respectively over the next twelve months we do not expect any material capital costs in our operations currently we believe that we have sufficient capital in the next twelve months for our current level of operations while we lost our only source of revenue effective december   we continue to seek replacement clients although we have no definite arrangements at this point in the alternative we may seek a merger candidate although we have not identified any definitive acquisitions at this time we do not anticipate needing to raise additional capital resources in the next twelve months our principal source of liquidity historically was our cash flow generated from our operations our business activity is closely tied to the us economy our ability to maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop alternative energy investments provide consulting to related parties with respect to their investments in alternative energy projects and our ability to generate revenues in any case we try to operate with minimal overhead our primary activity will be to seek to develop alternative energy investments and consequently increase our revenues we cannot guarantee that this will ever occur our plan is to build our company in any manner which will be successful                   item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  none   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as of the end of the period covered by this report based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules a e and de under the exchange act our chief executive officer and the chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective changes in internal control over financial reporting  there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting this report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting                   part ii  other information item   legal proceedings   there are no legal proceedings to which we are a party which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results   item a risk factors    you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all of the other information included in this document any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results and could negatively impact the value of your investment    the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result in this case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment we have a limited operating history while we have been profitable in the past we were not profitable in our most recent fiscal year and recent fiscal quarter  we may never be profitable again and as a result we could go out of business   we were formed as a colorado business entity in november  while we have been profitable in the past we were not profitable in our most recent fiscal year and recent fiscal quarter we have lost our only current client and have not been able to replace the revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be profitable again if we do not continue to be profitable we could go out of business   we have relied upon one client for all of our revenues which means that the loss of this client has severely impacted our operations if we cannot replace the lost revenue or merge with a company we could go out of business in the past one client accounted for  of our revenues this client was a related party eastmountain alternative energy llc eastmountain alternative energy llc gave notice to us that effective december   it planned to terminate the asset management services contract it had with us  we have been and could continue to be materially impacted by the loss of this client the loss of this one client makes us subject to uncertain revenue results with the termination of the asset management services contract between us and eastmountain alternative energy llc we no longer provide asset management services to any clients and have no current revenue source going forward while we have lost our only source of revenue we have been seeking additional clients to replace our lost revenue although we have no definite arrangements at this point in the alternative we may seek a merger candidate although we have not identified any definitive acquisitions at this time we cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace our lost revenue or to identify a merger candidate if we cannot either replace our lost revenue or identify a merger candidate we may eventually cease business an investor could lose his entire investment   our lack of operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance an investor could lose his entire investment we have a limited operating history an investor has no frame of reference to evaluate our future business prospects  this makes it difficult if not impossible to evaluate us as an investment an investor could lose his entire investment if our future business prospects do not result in profitability     if we do not generate adequate revenues to finance our operations our business may fail we began generating revenues in  as of march   we had a cash position of  and an additional  in certificates of deposit we anticipate that operating costs will range between  and  for the fiscal year ending december   these operating costs include insurance taxes utilities maintenance contract services and all other costs of operations we will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated however the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict we will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated however the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict since there can be no assurances that revenues will be sufficient to cover operating costs for the foreseeable future it may be necessary to raise additional funds due to our lack of operating history raising additional funds may be difficult competition in the alternative energy industry is intense    our business plan involves making investments in alternative energy projects this business is highly competitive there are numerous similar companies seeking such investments in the united states of america our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business our ability to develop our business will depend on our ability to successfully develop investments in this highly competitive environment we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully the share control position of westmountain green llc will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate actions                our largest shareholder westmountain green llc of which mr klemsz is a  member owns  shares and thereby controls approximately  of our outstanding shares because westmountain green llc individually beneficially controls more than a majority of the outstanding shares other shareholders individually or as a group will be limited in their ability to effectively influence the election or removal of our directors the supervision and management of our business or a change in control of or sale of our company even if they believed such changes were in the best interest of our shareholders generally   our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our president and treasurer and the continued financing of westmountain green llc                we depend almost entirely on the efforts and continued employment of mr klemsz our president and treasurer mr klemsz is our primary executive officer and we will depend on him for nearly all aspects of our operations in addition westmountain green llc is our only source of external financing we do not have an employment contract with mr klemsz and we do not carry key person insurance on his life the loss of the services of mr klemsz through incapacity or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on our business it would be very difficult to find and retain qualified personnel such as mr klemsz and a financing source to replace westmountain green llc at the present time there is no contractual commitment for westmountain green llc to fund us our revenue and profitability fluctuate particularly inasmuch as we cannot predict the timing of realization events in developing future investments which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause volatility in the price of our shares we may experience significant variations in revenues and profitability during the year the timing and receipt of income generated by bringing new alternative energy projects to market is event driven and thus highly variable which contributes to the volatility of our revenue and our ability to realize incentive income from our funds may be limited we cannot predict when or if any realization of investments will occur if we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter it may have a significant impact on our revenues and profits for that particular quarter which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters in addition our equity investments are adjusted for accounting purposes to fair value at the end of each quarter resulting in revenue attributable to our principal investments even though we receive no cash distributions from our equity funds which could increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings               difficult market conditions can adversely affect our funds in many ways including reducing the value or performance of the investments we make in our investments and reducing the ability of our company to raise or deploy capital which could materially reduce our revenue and results of operations if economic conditions are unfavorable our projects may not perform well and we may not be able to raise money in existing or new projects our investments will be materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world the global market and economic climate may deteriorate because of many factors beyond our control including rising interest rates or inflation terrorism or political uncertainty in the event of a market downturn our businesses could be affected in different ways a general market downturn or a specific market dislocation may cause our revenue and results of operations to decline by causing     ● the value of our investments to decrease   ● lower investment returns reducing incentive income and   ● material reductions in the value of our ownership in investments       furthermore while difficult market conditions may increase opportunities to make certain alternative energy investments such conditions also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by us with debt investments   the success of our business depends in part upon proprietary technologies and information which may be difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we believe that the identification acquisition and development of proprietary technologies are key drivers of our business our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents license the patents of others maintain the secrecy of our proprietary technology and information and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we currently do not license any patents we cannot assure you that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business that the patents that we license will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties that we will acquire additional proprietary technology that is patentable or that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties further we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop similar or superior technologies duplicate elements of any technology we may own or design around it   in order to successfully commercialize any proprietary technologies it is possible that we may need to acquire licenses to or to contest the validity of issued or pending patents or claims of third parties we cannot assure you that any license acquired under such patents would be made available to us on acceptable terms if at all or that we would prevail in any such contest in addition we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us for alleged infringement of another partys patents or in defending the validity or enforceability of our patents or in bringing patent infringement suits against other parties based on our patents in addition to the protection afforded by patents we may also rely on trade secrets proprietary knowhow and technology that we seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with our prospective joint venture partners employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets and proprietary knowhow will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others         because we are smaller and have fewer financial and other resources than many alternative energy companies we may not be able to successfully compete in the very competitive alternative energy industry alternative energy functions as a commodity there is significant competition among existing alternative energy producers our business could face competition from a number of producers that can produce significantly greater volumes of alternative energy than we can or expect to produce producers that can produce a wider range of products than we can and producers that have the financial and other resources that would enable them to expand their production rapidly if they chose to these producers may be able to achieve substantial economies of scale and scope thereby substantially reducing their fixed production costs and their marginal productions costs if these producers are able to substantially reduce their marginal production costs the market price of alternative energy products may decline and we may not be able to produce alternative energy products at a cost that allows us to operate profitably even if we are able to operate profitably these other producers may be substantially more profitable than us which may make it more difficult for us to raise any financing necessary for us to achieve our business plan and may have a materially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock increased alternative energy production in the united states could increase the demand for feedstocks and the resulting price of feedstocks reducing our profitability new alternative energy   projects are under construction throughout the united states increased production from alternative energy sources could increase feedstock demand and prices resulting in higher production costs and lower profits   price increases or interruptions in needed energy supplies could cause loss of customers and impair our profitability   alternative energy production requires a constant and consistent supply of energy if there is any interruption in our supply of energy for whatever reason such as availability delivery or mechanical problems we may be required to modify our operations if we modify operations for any extended period of time it will have a material adverse effect on our business natural gas and electricity prices have historically fluctuated significantly we expect to purchase significant amounts of these resources as part of our alternative energy production increases in the price of natural gas or electricity would harm our business and financial results by increasing our energy costs   risks related to government regulation and subsidization the united states alternative energy industry is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in that legislation or regulation could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the elimination or significant reduction in the federal tax incentive could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   the production of alternative energy has historically been related to federal tax incentives the elimination or significant reduction in the federal tax incentives on any or all alternative energy projects could negatively impact our proposed operations lax enforcement of environmental and energy policy regulations may adversely affect the demand for alternative energy products   our success will depend in part on effective enforcement of existing environmental and energy policy regulations many of our potential customers are unlikely to switch from the use of conventional fuels unless compliance with applicable regulatory requirements leads directly or indirectly to the use of alternative energy both additional regulation and enforcement of such regulatory provisions are likely to be vigorously opposed by the entities affected by such requirements if existing emissionsreducing standards are weakened or if governments are not active and effective in enforcing such standards our business and results of operations could be adversely affected even if the current trend toward more stringent emissions standards continues our future prospects will depend on the ability of alternative energy to satisfy these emissions standards more efficiently than other existing technologies certain standards imposed by regulatory programs may limit or preclude the use of our products to comply with environmental or energy requirements any decrease in the emission standards or the failure to enforce existing emission standards and other regulations could result in a reduced demand for alternative energy products a significant decrease in the demand for alternative energy products will reduce the price of such products adversely affect our profitability and decrease the value of your stock           costs of compliance with burdensome or changing environmental and operational safety regulations could cause our focus to be diverted away from our business and our results of operations to suffer   we expect to be subject to complicated environmental regulations of the us environmental protection agency and regulations and permitting requirements of the various states with respect to our alternative energy projects these regulations are subject to change and such changes may require additional capital expenditures or increased operating costs consequently considerable resources may be required to comply with future environmental regulations we do not currently expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in this or the succeeding fiscal year in addition our proposed projects could be subject to environmental nuisance or related claims by employees property owners or residents near our projects arising from air or water discharges environmental and public nuisance claims or tort claims based on emissions or increased environmental compliance costs could significantly increase our operating costs   any new alternative energy plants will be subject to federal and state laws regarding occupational safety risks of substantial compliance costs and liabilities are inherent in alternative energy production we may be subject to costs and liabilities related to worker safety and job related injuries some of which may be significant possible future developments including stricter safety laws for workers and other individuals regulations and enforcement policies and claims for personal or property damages resulting from operation of our projects could reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be available to further enhance our business   risks related to an investment in our common stock   the lack of a broker or dealer to create or maintain a market in our stock could adversely impact the price and liquidity of our securities   we have no agreement with any broker or dealer to act as a market maker for our securities and there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any market makers thus no broker or dealer will have an incentive to make a market for our stock the lack of a market maker for our securities could adversely influence the market for and price of our securities as well as your ability to dispose of or to obtain accurate information about andor quotations as to the price of our securities   we have limited experience as a public company we have only operated as a public company since january  we trade on the otc bulletin board under the trading symbol wetm thus we have limited experience in complying with the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to operate as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us   we may be required to register under the investment company act of  or the investment advisors act which could increase the regulatory burden on us and could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities because our proposed business involves the identification acquisition and development of alternative energy investments we may be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment advisors act and analogous state law while we believe that we are currently either not an investment company or an investment advisor or are exempt from registration as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment advisors act and analogous state law either the sec or state regulators or both may disagree and could require registration either immediately or at some point in the future as a result there could be an increased regulatory burden on us which could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities         we may be impacted by new regulatory requirements as a result of the passage of the doddfrank act in july  congress enacted the doddfrank act which instituted major changes in the regulatory regime for public companies particularly those in the financial sector at the present time we do not believe that we will be impacted in a material way by this legislation however the implementation of the provisions of the doddfrank act are subject to regulations which have not yet been written and its statutory provisions have not been the subject of extensive judicial review so we cannot guarantee that we may not come under its purview at some point in the future and be affected negatively by it our stock has a limited public trading market and there is no guarantee a trading market will ever develop for our securities there has been and continues to be a limited public market for our common stock an active trading market for our shares has not and may never develop or be sustained if you purchase shares of common stock you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the initial price you paid the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including the following      actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results      changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates      changes in market valuations of other companies particularly those that market services such as ours    announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments      introduction of product enhancements that reduce the need for the products our projects may develop      departures of key personnel of our total outstanding shares as of march   a total of  or approximately  will be restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future this could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly even if our business is doing well   as restrictions on resale end the market price of our stock could drop significantly if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them applicable sec rules governing the trading of penny stocks limit the liquidity of our common stock which may affect the trading price of our common stock   our common stock currently trades from time to time and always below  per share as a result our common stock is considered a penny stock and is subject to sec rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our shares can be publicly traded  these regulations require the delivery prior to any transaction involving a penny stock of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock and the associated risks  under these regulations certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the written purchasers agreement to a transaction prior to purchase  these regulations have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock           the overthecounter market for stock such as ours is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations the securities of companies such as ours have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations during certain periods these broad market fluctuations and other factors such as new product developments and trends in the industry and in the investment markets generally as well as economic conditions and quarterly variations in our operational results may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock buying lowpriced penny stocks is very risky and speculative our common shares are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  exclusive of the value of principal residence or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a brokerdealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement prior to the sale in addition the brokerdealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in the public markets   issuances of our stock could dilute current shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock if an active public trading market develops      we have the authority to issue up to  shares of common stock  shares of preferred stock and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval although no financing is planned currently we may need to raise additional capital to fund operating losses if we raise funds by issuing equity securities our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution in addition we could issue large blocks of our common stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further stockholder approval                the issuance of preferred stock by our board of directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock an issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could upon conversion or otherwise have all of the rights of our common stock our board of directors authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger tender offer proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve   colorado law and our articles of incorporation protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits which could make it difficult for us to recover damages from them in the event of a lawsuit      colorado law provides that our directors will not be liable to our company or to our stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors our articles of incorporation require us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law the exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence poor judgment or other circumstances the indemnification provisions may require our company to use our assets to defend our directors and officers against claims including claims arising out of their negligence poor judgment or other circumstances we do not expect to pay dividends on common stock we have not paid any cash dividends with respect to our common stock and it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future earnings if any that we may realize will be retained in the business for further development and expansion         item   unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds   none item

administrative costs were  for the six months ended june   compared to  for the six months ended june    most of the costs were attributable to professional and contract services we do not anticipate these professional fees to be as significant in the future however we believe that our selling general and administrative costs will increase as we grow our business activities going forward   we had

months ended june   compared to  for the six months ended june     cash flows provided by financing activities were  for the six months ended june   and june     over the next twelve months we do not expect to incur  material capital costs in our operations   we believe that we have sufficient capital for our current level of operations this is because we currently have sufficient revenue within our present organizational structure to be profitable we do not anticipate needing to raise additional capital in the next twelve months   our principal source of liquidity will be our operations we expect variation in revenues to account for the difference between a profit and a loss also business activity is closely tied to the us economy our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop alternative energy investments and our ability to generate revenues   in any case we try to operate with minimal overhead our primary activity will be to seek to develop alternative energy investments and consequently our revenues if we succeed in generating sufficient sales we will become profitable we cannot guarantee that

included in this document any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results and could negatively impact the value of your investment   the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result in this case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment   we have a limited operating history while we have been profitable for our two most recent fiscal year ends we may not continue to be

ends we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be profitable and as a result we could go out of business   we currently rely upon one client for all of our revenues which means that we could be severally impacted by the loss of the client    one client has accounted for all of our revenues for both  and  this client eastmountain alternative energy llc  is a related party our revenue projections are subject to greater uncertainty than if we had revenue commitments from a number of clients we could be materially impacted by the loss of this client as long as we rely upon one client for a majority of our revenue we could be subject to uncertain revenue results while we have no basis to believe that we will not continue to generate revenue from this client we cannot assure you that this client or any of our clients will continue to purchase our products or services in significant volume or at all   our lack of operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance an investor could lose his entire investment   we have a limited operating history an investor has no frame of reference to evaluate our future business prospects  this makes it difficult if not impossible to evaluate us as an investment an investor could lose his entire investment if our future business prospects do not result in our ever sustaining profitability     if we do not generate adequate revenues to finance our operations our business may fail   we began generating revenues in  as of june   we had a cash position of  and an additional  in certificates of deposit we anticipate that operating costs will range between  and  for the fiscal year ending december   these operating costs include insurance taxes utilities maintenance contract services and all other costs of operations we will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment

energy drinks very low calories and vegan also gluten free so whoever needs the gluten free energy drinks its here would you purchase again  yes original review deborah r california i dont drink energy drinks often mostly because they dont typically taste great and i drink coffee already however i was impressed with guru i couldnt put my finger on the flavor at first but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste kind of like matcha the nose is citrusy and refreshing that said although i stayed perky after drinking it i would say its safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too and if youre dead tired it might not make much of a difference it only has caffeine from the tea so not at all the crack type of artificial energy drink like a monster or red bull which i think taste gross and are horrible for you would you purchase again  yes original review mark w california this brand really holds up to the competition

you purchase again  yes original review la c california im not big on mainstream energy drinks so im happy that theres a more natural organic variation i probably wont drink a ton of them but i would

review victor v california great drink natural drink nothing like oranic fresh taste to energize you i will buy more at local store it is very good like nothing else would you purchase again  yes original review natalie h california organic energy drink by guru in flavor original tasted great i like the fact it taste good and is low in calories it also contains caffeine organically which was an additional bonus after drinking it is was able to push through my day and didnt have a crash later on i would recommend this product to anyone and i will be buying it in the future would you purchase again  yes original review jack d california this product tastes great i absolutely loved it and felt very energetic about  minutes after drinking it it tastes great when chilled although i would think it probably tastes good at room temperature as well if i ever feel the need for some energy i would definitely purchase this product recommended would you purchase again  yes original review victoria h california i personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks i rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming although energy drinks can be considered a crutch its a lifestyle decision that many many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid i am one of these people that said guru energy is fairly cheap usdcan if you buy it here off amazon it comes in the redbull standard  floz cans and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case compare this to monster rockstar or any other brand with standard  floz cans the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape i think a particular good feature of guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup i appreciate a good quality soda particularly microbrew colas and they often exclusively contain cane sugar so in summary this energy drink is fairly cheap good buzz all natural and great for coding gaming or studying would you purchase again  yes original review sangeeta m california nice drink for a pickmeup  refreshing and pleasant tasting ideal replacement for a soda  the carbonation without all the sugar was perfectly satisfying zero guilt would you purchase again  no original review ashley b california the biggest question is does it work the answer to your question is yes i was busy all day long and had the best energy ive had in awhile it feels a lot better than using redbull im very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy i have no question about that but this energy felt like ive slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever so pretty much i felt really good the taste isnt the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it its a little herbaly but not bad just different would you purchase again  yes original review christine f california i love it its sweet kind of tastes like this other energy drink brand ive tried before it tastes very good and not nasty or smell like alcohol like others do sure would rebuy again totally recommend this brand would you purchase again  yes original review cindy w california im a big fan of energy drinks so i consider myself somewhat of an expert and i must say this perticular energy drinkguru was quite surprising so if you get a chance to try one like i did please doyou wont be sorry trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review angela a california the taste was good i dont feel like it gave me more energy but it tasted good it was a good size as well would recommend and buy again for sure would you purchase again  yes original review milo s california coming from someone who at one point drank a decent amount of monster energy drinks i can say that the guru organic energy drink definitely makes me feel

if they are available the next time i want one would you purchase again  yes original review sarah h california i really enjoyed this energy drink it kept me alert but not at all jittery so many

whiffs of the red bull scent so i was quite surprised after tasting it not only did it not taste like red bull it had a fruity flavor which is a plus i liked how it was carbonated and that all the ingredients were organic and natural i tried the regular flavor which was a bit too sweet for me so the lite may have been a better choice nonetheless the original was still pretty good i do not know if i would recommend it since the sugar g is quite high for one serving but over other energy drinks i would it is probably the best tasting energy drink i have tried so far would you purchase again

original review tim f california i drink a lot of coffee and a lot of energy drinks this was was pretty good it wasnt my favorite but i enjoyed it the flavor reminded me if two things at first it sort

sugar content then dont get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too the can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like im not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic the product isnt priced the most competitively but maybe that is because i purchased it at bristol farms i wouldnt be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less i enjoyed my guru chilled but i totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature overall im happy with my guru experience would you purchase again  yes original review eliazar r

energy drink i have tried still not my favorite flavor but not bad i love that it is organic and does not have all of the artificial ingredients many other energy drinks have would you purchase again  yes original review valerie f california i dont usually buy traditional energy drinks because i prefer clean ingredients this guru energy drink is very clean its organic too and has very low calories i actually liked the taste a lot better than i thought i would but you can definitely taste the stevia its a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out i did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work id probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunchearly afternoon at work would you purchase again  yes original review courtney s california i really enjoyed the sustained healthy energy this drink provided other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin b like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary which causes an energy crash this one takes a more natural approach the result is a productive pep that does not make you feel or seem like youre on crack and it doesnt cause a sudden drop in energy either the energizing ingredients are green tea extract guarana seed and ginseng there is also echinacea which is great for the immune system at first i found the stevia to be overwhelming but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping i have a suspicion i would like the nonlite version a bit more but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia would you purchase again  yes original review laura w california this seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it it has no color and has a light refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste without being too much it has natural organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols erythritol etc which usually cause me problems i therefore felt a nice natural energy boost without any discomfort loved it would you purchase again  yes original review alison e california it was easy to drink and i really like that the ingredients are organic the flavor is good with a slight vitamin aftertaste it has comparable amounts of caffeine to other brands of energy drinks with nonnatural ingredients overall it tasted good and i would buy it again would you purchase again  yes original review sheila t kansas while i occasionally consume energy drinks i often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that i can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize i wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products and im also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste as such i was really interested in learning about and trying out guru organic energy which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine given that i avoid calories in drinks i chose the lite version to try and i was pleasantly surprised the flavor was different and although i wouldnt say it was delicious it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks ive tried i didnt feel a huge kick of energy but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and i did feel alert if not energetic overall i think the guru organic energy drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients although im not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks the next time i want one i will choose guru organic trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review ashley z california surprisingly good i wasnt expecting this drink to be lightly carbonatedit was a nice surprise flavor was good and it definitely gave noticeable energy i tried it before a workout in place of my preworkout drink i wouldnt replace my preworkout supplement it gave me a less focused energy but i would drink it if i needed a little pick me up throughout the day would you purchase again  yes original review phyllis c california i love the fruity fizzy taste and the amazing list of organic and natural ingredients best of all it doesnt give me the jitters like coffee would i could concentrate and get a lot of work done as im trying to eat clean and stay away from sugar an unsweetened version would be awesome as it is im pretty happy with guru energy drink would you purchase again  yes original review stephany c california i got the original guru and what i liked about this drink was that it didnt taste like a energy drink it was light and it didnt have that strong caffeine aftertaste the price is reasonable for bein g a usda verified drino which i think is very important i have already told my friends who lik energy drinks and they sell this product at my local bristol farms which is great thanks for the drink would you purchase again  yes original review tirza v california great taste and good energy level i did not feel jittery or have a crash afterwards like i have experienced with other products so glad theres no artificial ingredients stevia is the way to go would you purchase again  yes original review janet l california its pretty tasty i have tried many energy drinks in the past that have really bad

can tell the difference in the buzz also not as much as a crash the taste is good too not artificial would you purchase again  yes original review felicia c california i loved the fresh crisp taste of the sparkling water blended with the organic ingredients of cane sugargrape juicecitric and apple acid along with the vital nutrients of organic green tea leafguarana seedechinacea flower and panax

which is a plus but i wouldnt buy it myself with its price would you purchase again  no original review karolina p california so i got to try the guru lite energy drink the taste was very different from most energy drinks i like the strong lemon juice taste it has for a drink that has less calories then the original it does work kept me going all day through work which is awesome overall great stuff for only  calories a must buytrynatural would you purchase again  yes original review cooper q california grate tasting and very good product kept me focused awith no crash all day the flavor

unlike most stevia sweetened drinks the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste theres a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is onpoint i dont usually drink energy drinks but this one is an exception to the rule its organic low calorie nongmo and contains ingredients that i can actually trust another big bonus i noticed is that i did not experience a crash afterwards i read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturallyoccurring caffeine from green tea and guarana i dont know why you would drink any other energy drink than this definitely loading up on these again soon would you purchase again  yes original review rebecca h california this product is packed with good natural ingredients unlike most energy drinks out there and still packs the same amount of caffeine the flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks which i didnt mind i have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me however i did not have the same issues with this drink i really enjoyed it if there is one thing i could say about it is there wasnt any selection at the store i went to they had one flavor of the drink in one size the drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks i would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multipack with a small discount would you purchase again  yes original review debbie z california good taste and no jittery feeling i will definitely recommend this drink to my friends only problem is that it should be

drink could taste as good as guru does i will definitely buy guru energy drinks again definitely would recommend it to friends would you purchase again  yes original review peter o california really good tasting product the thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull but with a more pleasing aftertaste it reminded me of cane sugar soda but much healthier there are g of

crisp tangy citrus flavor that doesnt have a large aftertaste and gives me enough energy in the morning on my slow days would you purchase again  yes original review sophia h california i dont usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and i get shaky but with half a can of this drink i didnt feel overcaffeinated i liked that it is low in calories and organic but that also limits where i can buy it in the future i dont usually shop at sprouts or whole foods so this would only be something i would get when i rarely make it into those stores would you purchase again  yes original review laura c california the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape would you purchase again  yes original review mary c california i tried the lite version and it has a nice fruity taste it tastes much better than other energy drinks on the market the price in the market is comparable to other brands would you purchase again  yes original review keyvan a california the drink tastes very good but the package is too

was ready for bed i slept soundly definitely a great product would you purchase again  yes original review zemyna r massachusetts this was a surprisingly pleasant beverage i dont usually like energy drinks every now and again i break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee but im not a big energy drink person i think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat this one surprisingly seemed to have neither of those it was fresh tasting if you can believe it and i found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it the one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink the energy it did supply however came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects and for that i am quite grateful i may not buy it often but next time i reach for an energy drink ill definitely reach for guru and i will not hesitate to suggest it to friends would you purchase again  yes

definitely a plus for those looking for non synthetics and wanting natural energy would you purchase again  yes original review cita v california great energy drink i would definitely try it again its
