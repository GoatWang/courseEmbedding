background variant perception was founded by a team of market professionals with decades of combined experience within asset management proprietary trading and the qualitativequantitative modeling disciplines  regular research commentaries provide a high level of value to any firm that is interested in using macroeconomic research to formulate trading strategies manage assets or aid decision making what distinguishes variant perception from other research providers leading indicators are used to give leading insights providing an advanced read on the business cycle and recessions in real time economists are terrible at predicting recessions –  out of  economists missed the last four recessions economists miss recessions because they focus on lagging indicators rather than the leading indicators we reference independent highly datadriven and agnostic variant perception is not wedded to any point of view and follows leading indicators even if the consensus disagrees economists also miss recessions because of the vintage data problem they reference heavily revised data the datadriven and forwardlooking analysis removes any reliance on data that will later be revised and variant perception’s independence allows it to always take the agnostic viewpoint focused only on outliers and good trade ideas the blowups and potential success stories wall street research is produced by rote and is too copious an economist for france will write about france regardless of the importance or relevance of the content a style that is crisp and short utilizing powerful charts time is short and variant perception believes the data tells the most powerful story no one likes convoluted research or having to sort through many daily emails to find what is important variant perception keeps reports succinct and lets the data tell the story framework variant perception employs a clear and thoughtful research framework focusing on market themes strategies and tactics themes how is the global economy changing at the highest and most fundamental levels a broad suite of economic data in addition to proprietary indicators informs analyst views about different economies  months to
