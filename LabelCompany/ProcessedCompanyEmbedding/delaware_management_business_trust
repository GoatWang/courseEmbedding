delaware courts international clients internet law blog links biography hiring an attorney location start and manage your case delaware business trusts benefits of delaware statutory business trusts there are many benefits to using a delaware business trust to hold assets over other legal forms and if you are considering using a business trust created under delawares statutory trust laws we would like to explore that option with you delaware business trusts dbt can provide benefits in the reduction of gift estate and other taxes and in the protection of asset and owners the dbt is an unincorporated business association used to hold assets for the benefit of the trust owners flexibility and statutory stability delaware business trusts are preferred by many for structured financing regardless of whether a business is financially healthy restructuring or going through a reorganization this is in part because the dbt offers flexibility and statutory features designed to reduce risk just as a stockholder of a private corporation enjoys a shield from the liabilities of the corporation delaware business trusts provide a similar shield for the benefit of the ultimate beneficiaries this is because the trust is a separate legal entity and may conduct any lawful business or activity delaware benefits delaware is a recognized leader when it comes to corporate and business law with a reknown court of chancery hearing business matters a tight and nonpolitical relationship between the delaware bar and the delaware legislature to keep business law current a stable and respected body of business law and no income tax on passive income from trusts compared to common law trusts arent new and common law trusts are still in use by many and an option to be considered on a case by case basis theyve been used for centuries to preserve and protect property for the wealthy and to conduct business where a flexible entity was desirable however theres a benefit to trust created under the delaware business trust act which unlike common law relating to trusts is current and creates certainty in modern commercial transactions easy and inexpensive to create a delaware business trust can be established with relatively little effort and expense and the trust income is not subject to delaware state income tax additionally delaware business trusts provide a level of ownership privacy that is appealing to many taxpayers our trust department there is no fill in the blank form to create the trust agreement however careful planning with an attorney and an accountant are key to the success when it comes to trusts our law office works with a wide range of clients including bank trust officers investment bankers drafting attorneys bond counsel funds administrators corporate trust professionals transactional attorneys underwriters we offer streamlined processing of business trusts knowledge and expertise in trust management prompt and individualized service experience in working with clients from around the globe uses for a delaware trust a dbt may carry on any lawful business or activity whether or not conducted for profit including holding title property in an active or custodial capacity the principal advantage of the dbt act is flexibility the act enables individuals to create a structure with greater flexibility and to create management structure by contract some of the types of businesses that can benefit from a delaware business trust include credit card companies car dealerships mortgage companies movie theatre chains pharmaceutical companies many others the kinds of assets that can be held in trust are things like licensing fees from patents and other intellectual property land owned by a trust and leased to businesses money from the sale of negotiable documents and many others the dbt act was hatched in the business savvy environment of delawares other stateoftheart business legislation such as the laws governing corporations limited partnerships and limited liability companies the administrative advantages of a dbt distinguish it from some forms of business entities while it is likened to others a dbt need only file a simple certificate of trust with the delaware secretary of state in order to take advantage of the act very much like llcs there is not a requirement to file the contractual instrument of a dbt therefore the nature of the business as well as the identities of the beneficial owners of a dbt are not necessarily a matter of public record delawares court of chancery has jurisdiction over a dbt and any contested matters relating to the internal affairs of a dbt the rights and responsibilities of its trustees and beneficial owners and the interpretation of its contractual instrument to talk with us about delaware business trusts contact our office by phone at    or send us an email at infodelawofficecom we are located at  barksdale professional center
