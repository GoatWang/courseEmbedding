downside francois’ incredible track record in successfully interpreting the trends that can be found in leading indicators and other macroeconomic data have also led to his well deserved reputation as an expert in sector rotation  providing investors on both the long and short side of the market opportunities to profit from his ideas in my opinion his most important and influential macro prediction to date was his call in the middle of the last decade when he predicted that the worst housing crisis in american history would soon be upon us and that it would have farranging implications for both the global economy and world financial markets”from the foreword by robert doll vice chairman  cio of global equities blackrock advisors llc“francois trahan is an insightful observer and student of
