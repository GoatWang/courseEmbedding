in conjunction with the south australian film corporation she also developed the idea for childrens television programs such as the miraculous mellops and hi the idea was for a television drama set on an australian rural property with two halfsisters running the property inherited from their father with an allfemale workforce she developed the idea from stories from friends who grew up in the country and from the love of south australian landscapes as shown in the paintings of hans heysen graemeevans pitched the idea to the board of the nine network who agreed to film a telemovie in march  with jack thompson starring as the father jack mcleod whose death leads to the two halfsisters portrayed by kym wilson as tess and tammy macintosh as claire inheriting the property following the success of the telemovie shown on mothers day  the nine network board agreed to commission a  episode series but the project was left on the shelf for four years it was not until late  after the

popular actor with the show itself winning most popular australian drama series in  and  the show then began to decline in popularity and perceived quality cast turnover was high and increasingly farfetched explanations were employed to explain the sudden departure of formerly important characters such as rachael carpani who departed in  and aaron jeffery who left in   marked the point at which many viewers considered the show to have jumped the shark as the show had drifted into a new direction that of a soap opera at that point the show began to experience low ratings aaron jeffery commented to the daily telegraph that his desire to depart from the show was due to the new direction the show was taking which he did not like the th episode of mcleods daughters aired on  october

developed the idea for mcleods daughters in the early s for her company millenium pictures in conjunction with the south australian film corporation she also developed the idea for childrens television programs such as the miraculous mellops and hi the idea was for a television drama set on an australian rural property with two halfsisters running the property inherited from their father with an allfemale workforce she developed the idea from stories from friends who grew up in the country and from the love of south australian landscapes as shown in the paintings of hans heysen graemeevans pitched the idea to the board of the nine network who agreed to film a telemovie in march  with jack thompson starring as the father jack mcleod whose death leads to the two halfsisters portrayed by kym wilson as tess and tammy macintosh as claire inheriting the property following the success of the telemovie shown on mothers day  the nine network board agreed to commission a

decline in popularity and perceived quality cast turnover was high and increasingly farfetched explanations were employed to explain the sudden departure of formerly important characters such as rachael carpani who departed in  and aaron jeffery who left in   marked the point at which many viewers considered the show to have jumped the shark as the show had drifted into a new direction that of a soap opera at that point the show began to experience low ratings aaron jeffery commented to the daily telegraph that his desire to depart from the show was due to the new direction the show was

developed the idea for mcleods daughters in the early s for her company millenium pictures in conjunction with the south australian film corporation she also developed the idea for childrens television programs such as the miraculous mellops and hi the idea was for a television drama set on an australian rural property with two halfsisters running the property inherited from their father with an allfemale workforce she developed the idea from stories from friends who grew up in the country and from the love of south australian landscapes as shown in the paintings of hans heysen graemeevans pitched the idea to the board of the nine network who agreed to film a telemovie in march  with jack thompson starring as the father jack mcleod whose death leads to the two halfsisters portrayed by kym wilson as tess and tammy macintosh as claire inheriting the property following the success of the telemovie shown on mothers day  the nine network board agreed to commission a  episode series but the project was left on the shelf for four years it was not until late  after the opening ceremony for the  sydney olympics featured a the man from snowy river theme which highlighted the cultural significance of the bush to australians success and cancellationedit the two original protagonists of the series tess bridie carter  left and claire lisa chappell  right the

including lisa chappell winning most popular female actor and aaron jeffery winning most popular actor with the show itself winning most popular australian drama series in  and  the show then began to decline in popularity and perceived quality cast turnover was high and increasingly farfetched explanations were employed to explain the sudden departure of formerly important characters such as rachael carpani who departed in  and aaron jeffery who left in   marked the point at which many viewers considered the show to have jumped the shark as the show had drifted into a new direction that of a soap opera at that point the show began to experience low ratings aaron jeffery commented to the daily telegraph that his desire to depart from the show was due to the new direction the show was taking which he did not like the th episode of mcleods daughters aired on  october  with hugh mcleod grace jasmine and regans father returning for this special event an entirely different script was

in conjunction with the south australian film corporation she also developed the idea for childrens television programs such as the miraculous mellops and hi the idea was for a television drama set on an australian rural property with two halfsisters running the property inherited from their father with an allfemale workforce she developed the idea from stories from friends who grew up in the country and from the love of south australian landscapes as shown in the paintings of hans heysen graemeevans pitched the idea to the board of the nine network who agreed to film a telemovie in march  with jack thompson starring as the father jack mcleod whose death leads to the two halfsisters portrayed by kym wilson as tess and tammy macintosh as claire inheriting the property following the success of the telemovie shown on mothers day  the nine network board agreed to commission a  episode series but the project was left on the shelf for four years it was not until late  after the

popular actor with the show itself winning most popular australian drama series in  and  the show then began to decline in popularity and perceived quality cast turnover was high and increasingly farfetched explanations were employed to explain the sudden departure of formerly important characters such as rachael carpani who departed in  and aaron jeffery who left in   marked the point at which many viewers considered the show to have jumped the shark as the show had drifted into a new direction that of a soap opera at that point the show began to experience low ratings aaron jeffery commented to the daily telegraph that his desire to depart from the show was due to the new direction the show was taking which he did not like the th episode of mcleods daughters aired on  october
