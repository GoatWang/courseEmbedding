performance in the second quarter and the first half  was right in line with expectations on the top line our revenues increased  in the second quarter and  for the first six months over the prior year periods on the bottom line our net income per diluted share in the second quarter and first half of  grew  and  respectively over the prior year and included the impact of the issuance over the  million shares in our first quarter equity offering our results are the reflection of the continued execution of our operational tactical and strategic initiatives and plans which include the successful execution and integration of key acquisitions and the expansion initiatives over the last  months our focus on capacity planning talent engagement leadership teamwork and targeted capital deployment and alignment with our disciplined capital allocation strategy now ill turn the call over to andy who will further review our markets and performance andy nemeth thank you todd now only did we see continued market strength in the second quarter of  in our primary markets but also continued to strategically leverage the strengths of our operating and financial platform in alignment with our strategic growth initiatives with our recent acquisition of three separate companies under the leisure product enterprises umbrella in april  and several marine related acquisitions prior to that our growing presence in this market is becoming more significant representing  of our second quarter sales and  yeartodate he marine market complements our current portfolio of products and core competencies and is a natural fit within the growing popularity of the recreational and leisure lifestyle we also recently announced in july  the acquisition of wire design which complements our existing wire harness brands and capabilities with product knowledge design and engineering expertise high quality product lines and opportunities to increase capacity and support of our growing markets now lets turn to some specifics to fix on each of the industries we serve our sales to the rv industry represent our largest segment accounting for  of our  sale this industry continues its strong yearoveryear improvement with the sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in wholesale unit shipped since  the second quarter is traditionally represented the largest number of wholesale units shipped averaging approximately  of total annual shipments and wholesale shipments grew  in the second quarter over the prior year leading that growth was a tillable ph market which represents approximately  of all unit shipped in light with recent trends travel trailer shipments led the way increasing  in q  and comprising approximately  of all tillable units shipped fifth wheel units shipments increased  in the quarter versus the prior year period marking its fourth consecutive quarter with double digit growth the motorized sector of the industry which represents approximately  of all rv shipments grew  to the second quarter of  and was led by class bs and cs which were up  in the quarter while class a shipments declined slightly in the quarter yeartodate rv wholesale units shipments were up  comparatively on the retail side combined domestic and canadian retail shipments through may are up  versus  this growth mirrors wholesale led by travel trailers and class b and c motorhomes increasing  and  representatively and statistically points to our balanced inventories in consistency with prior year as we continue to move through the  selling season as we previously mentioned we have continued to expand our presence in the adjacent marine market through acquisitions and organic growth beginning with the acquisition of charleston in late  followed by better way products in february  bh electronics in july of last year and our most recent acquisition of leisure products in april of this year which consists of three marine components suppliers namely marine concepts florida marine tanks and marine electrical products we believe our combination of design engineering and manufacturing capabilities along with our increasing geographic footprint and comprehensive product offerings bring a unique value proposition to our customers in the marine space allowing brand individuality and continuing opportunities to provide fully integrated solution to the marine oems our sales to the marine industry primarily focused on the powerboat sector of the market which comprised of four main categories fiber glass aluminum fine tune ph and ski and wake in  fiberglass accounted for approximately  of the sector aluminum  finetune ph was  and ski and wake was  according to the national marine manufacturers association its estimated that there are approximately  million registered powerboats in the us retail sales and wholesale shipments in this market and seasonal and are traditionally strongest in q and q this market has been making a steady recovery averaging single to middigit annual growth rates since  powerboat retail shipments grew  in  and through june  industry data indicates the powerboat sector to be up an estimated  compared to the prior year period on the manufacturing housing of our business mh sales represented  of our total revenue in the second quarter we estimate growth in this industry of approximately  compared to the prior year the companys industrial revenues which represent  of our consolidated revenue base in the quarter increased  reflecting both acquisition and organic growth residential housing starts were up  from the second quarter of  and  on a yeartodate basis as we head into q we expect continuing strong demand indiscernible and consistent seasonality with prior years in september the rv oems will hold their annual open houses for dealers which have been the norm of the business for almost a decade coming off of a successful  model year season the model year changes for the upcoming  selling season will be wrapping up in anticipation of these shows and as a result we expect some potential seasonal softening in the rv industry consistent with historical trends beginning in the third quarter and extending through october with an anticipated pick up in order rates as we head into the first quarter in early june the rvia revised their current full year outlook and now project rv wholesale unit shipments to surpass  units in  and to grow beyond  units in  generating annual growth rates of approximately  and  ph respectively these anticipated wholesale shipment growth rates are evidence of the continued strong affinity customers have for travel and leisure lifestyle we remain bullish on the industry as a whole and as we head in to the model change and dealer show season in the third and fourth quarters the marine model is similar to that of that rv model as both are based on and supported by the consumers desire for increasingly active outdoor leisure based family oriented lifestyle and we expect continued upside opportunity and potential for both continued industry growth and for us to continue to grow in this market strategically organically and through expansion on the mh side we are currently forecasting approximate  growth in mh wholesale unit shipments for  and expect to see continued yearoveryear improvement with limited risk in the near term and industrial markets represent a breadth of product opportunities for us to capitalize on our core competencies both through acquisition and organic market penetration the nahb is predicting full year  housing starts to increase approximately  compared to  on the expansion front the robots growth in the rv market has led to production expansion efforts and investments from the major oems to meet the increased demand and we have and expect to continue to make investments in our work force facilities and acquisitions to align with and support these efforts our expansion facilities in the pacific northwest for lamination and softwoods as well solid surface operations in southern california and mississippi are all up and running and meeting or exceeding plan overall we remain focused on driving value through the disciplined execution of our capital allocation strategy and supporting our customers growth initiatives through strategic investment and capital expenditures and facility improvement initiatives as we head into the second half of  and throughout  ill now turn the call over to josh who will provide additional comments on our financial performance josh boone thanks andy our net sales for the second quarter increased  million or  over the prior year period to  million reflecting growth in all four of our primary markets the impact of acquisitions completed in  and through the first half of  as well as market share geographic and product expansion efforts our  acquisition of medallion plastics in march and of leisure products in april contributed approximately  million to our second quarter  consolidated sales our rv revenues were up  in the second quarter reflecting an increase in wholesale shipments of  on a trailing month basis our rv content per unit increased  from  per unit to  per unit on the marine side our revenues nearly quadrupled versus the prior year and represented  of our second quarter  sales up from  in the first quarter our mh revenues increased  for the quarter on estimated unit shipment improvements at  our mh content per unit on a trailing  months basis increased an estimated  from  per unit to  per unit and finally our investor revenues were up  in the quarter the increased industrial revenues were driven by  increase in new housing starts in the second quarter the acquisitions we completed in  in the first half of  and our continued focus on leveraging growth synergies across the organization product portfolio expansion and the entrants into new markets and geographic region our gross margin in the second quarter was  up  basis points from  the gross margin was positively impacted in the quarter by the leveraging of our fixed cost on increased revenues and synergies related to acquisitions offset by the negative impact of higher labor cost as we continue to combat the tight labor market in the midwest operating expenses increased to  of sales in the second quarter of  compared to  in the prior year warehouse and delivery declined  basis and sga increased as a percentage of net sales to  and  in the second quarter of  intangible assets amortization increased  basis points as a result of our continued acquisition activity factors contributing to the higher sga in both the second quarter and the first six months of  include the investments made in certain leadership roles and employee talent and retention to support our continued strategic growth plans for  and beyond additionally as previously discussed certain acquisitions completed in  and  have a higher sga expense profile relative to patricks overall sga expense profile operating income increased  million or  in the second quarter compared to the prior year operating margins in the second quarter were  compared to  in  primarily due to the factors previously described our net income per diluted share in the second quarter of  was up  to  compared to  in the prior year the  increase included the impact of the initial shares issued related to the equity offering in the first quarter of  after the initial shares net income per diluted shares would have increased  compared to the second quarter of  the adoption of the new accounting standard related to share based payments resulted in the increase to our previously reported second quarter  net income and net income per diluted share of  and  respectively the comparable amounts for the second quarter of  favorably impacted net income by  and  per diluted share respectively now turning to the balance sheet our total assets increased approximately  million from december   primarily reflecting the growth in our business the addition of acquisition and the related seasonal working capital ramp up in the first half of the year our leverage position relative to ebitda was at  times at the end of the second quarter down from just under two times at the end of  unused available under our credit facility including cash on hand at the end of the first six months of  was approximately  million for the first six months of  we generated approximately  million of operating cash flows compared to  million in the first six months of  cash flows in the first half of the year were impacted by normal seasonal increases in the working capital to support the strong revenue growth in addition due to the timing of the end of our fiscal quarter compared with the payment cycles of certain of our customers cash flows from operating activities do not reflect the receipt of approximately  million in cash payments related to trade receivables within the days following the end of our fiscal quarter our capital spending in the first half of  of approximately  million focused on strategic investments and capacity geographic expansion increased efficiencies as well as new process and product development for the full year  we are currently estimating our capital expenditures to be approximately  million with a potential increase of another  million identified for capacity and expansion efforts to support the continued strength and momentum in our markets finally on the stock repurchases growth there were no shares repurchased in the second quarter of  we intend to continue to evaluate and strategically consider share repurchases for the remainder of  that completes my remarks todd todd cleveland thanks josh overall we remain optimistic about the expected continued industry growth and potential both throughout the remainder of  and  and beyond as we look ahead to leveraging our solid financial talent and service leadership platform and strengthening our position in the markets we serve were focused on increasing our product offering and value propositions to our customers as we further expand our presence into all of our primary markets and continue to build on the momentum of the industries we serve positive demographics strong retail trends and demand in the family oriented leisure and recreational lifestyle markets improving consumer credit equity markets strength and resilience and consumer confidence all play a significant role in the ongoing growth we anticipate in addition the strategic acquisitions we made in  and thus far in  both increased our scale in existing markets and further opened doors to new markets within our geographic footprint most recently within the marine arena our acquisition pipeline continues to be full with acquisition opportunity across all four of the primary markets we serve and we have the wherewithal and capacity to continue to grow our business and bring new innovative product lines to our existing customer base and to customers who we have not yet reached our disciplined execution goals continue to be focused around driving our organizational strategic agenda and utilizing our capital allocation strategy to strategically grow our business increase our customer awareness with the breadth of products we provide make investments in our work force and capacity initiatives both to support and grow our businesses and brands and drive shareholder value im confident in the ability of our team members to continue to execute on our strategic plan in addition the ongoing support we received from our customers  plus team members supplier order directors banking partners and our shareholders who are privileged to serve have afforded us the opportunity to subscribe for our goals of providing the highest level of quality service and shareholder value this is the end of our prepared remarks we are now ready to take questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from scott stember with cl king you may begin scott stember can you guys just give what the total incremental acquisition revenues were in the quarter and what the organic sales growth was josh boone so for our acquisitions to play ph in  we had  million revenues for the quarter our organic growth for the quarter was  including industry growth and if we back out industry growth we had market share organic growth of  so really strong quarter for us in the topline including our organic growth scott stember got it and it clearly looks like some of the decontenting issues that weve seen over the last year and a half are starting to abate fifth wheel shipments are picking back up can we maybe just talk about your thoughts about that as we head into the second part of the year todd cleveland yes weve seen stronger shipments definitely on the fifth wheel side while the low end indiscernible we feel are still going to be a significant part of the market and continue to grow but the fifth wheel definitely continue to rebound so we are pretty happy with the way things are coming together overall from a shipment standpoint scott stember got it and on the operating margins are we still thinking as of last quarter that we could be up  to  basis points by the end of the year todd cleveland yes we expect margin for the second half of the year on the operating line in the quarter we had some impacts still from the labor component that’s starting to abate significantly with investments that weve made we probably had about  basis points in the quarter impact on the labor line impacting our margins and we expect that to continue to decrease throughout the remainder of the year but we would expect after the basis points impact to labor that were going to experience on an annualized basis this year that we could give the  to  basis points for the  scott stember so that’s including or not including the labor issues todd cleveland not including  to  bps not including the labor impact that would offset that scott stember okay got it and just one last final one and then ill jump back in the queue maybe just talk about the boat side on marine side clearly you are building up some very nice synergies there maybe just talk about the margin profile of this business versus the rv industrial and mh and some of the opportunities going forward thank you andy nemeth were very excited about the marine space there is a lot of similarities with what we see in the rv space related to vertical integration opportunities at the customer level for us to be able to continue to provide value and quality solutions and fully integrated solutions to the oem so were very excited about that as it relates to the margin profile overall we would say that we view the margin profile as accretive to overall patrick consolidated numbers and opportunities so again i think that there is continued expansion opportunity there organically through acquisition and as well on the margin side operator and our next question comes from daniel moore with cjs securities you may begin daniel moore just wanted to touch in drill down a little bit on your comments regarding q you mentioned typical seasonal slowing in q to the october timeframe as we get into new models in the rv open house do you still expect shipments to be up yearoveryear just wanted to see if we can drill down on that statement a little bit andy nemeth yes we expect shipments to be up there is a little bit of choppiness in q related to the show season weve also got less days in the quarter so we look at q things do slow up a little bit they always get units ready for the shows and so again i think we are going to see continued strong demand continue to improve shipment levels but were heading into that kind of q timeframe where we do see things kind of pull back just a little bit daniel moore so slowing growth but still positive growth yearoveryear andy nemeth yes daniel moore any sense for your revenue growth for the month of july andy nemeth we don’t give forward guidance on that dan but what i will tell you is that everything is according to plan right now as it relates to kind of q on our expectations daniel moore and on the margins in q when you touched on sga you gave a lot of color around labor anything else unusual you’ve obviously completed some larger acquisitions any sort of onetime items or cost that you might call out in the sga line in q josh boone with the acquisition of leisure products relatively larger on an acquisition scale for us we did have some onetime cost related to the transaction costs associated with it and purchase accounting to the tune of about  or  of eps in the quarter it was actually split closer to gross margin and sga so it impacted both gross margin and sga daniel moore and we talked about marine can you just spend a minute and just reminding us you globed together the really interesting overall solution production set tell us where exactly you are playing in marine what your content for both looks like if you have that type of data available and is  a reasonable proxy or run rate for the overall percentage of revenue that is now embedded in the marine space thanks todd cleveland ill comment first on that so our revenues for the quarter on the marine side were  of sales up from  in q and a little over  in the prior year but we didn’t feel the full effects of leisure products in the quarter so on a go forward basis i think it will be still high single digits but closer to  to  on a full annualized basis when we did the acquisition of leisure products we talked about annualized revenues in the marine space of  million at time of acquisition so closer to that  to  andy nemeth we expect growing contribution from the marine space as we continue to head forward there is a lot of opportunity were really in the early stages of what i would call the marine model development related to again the opportunities that are there us to be able to continue to expand our footprint right now we are playing in the fiberglass electronics dash panel kind of product space were also with leisure products we picked up fuel tanks as well as tooling design and much more fiberglass capabilities and capacity as well as design engineering expertise for us to be able to really bring value to the marine oems related to again that fully integrated product line and so again we feel like there is a lot of opportunity there so its really the content for both we haven’t accumulated that yet we are in the process of putting that together but our marine model is really in that early stages of development at this point daniel moore and then lastly that feeds into that’s obviously been a big area of focus of ma you’ve already essentially put the proceeds of the recent equity offering to work what does the pipeline look like going forward is marine the primarily sort of the paramount in terms of likelihood for further deals and there are larger deals in the pipeline that you could execute over the next six to  months that’s it thanks todd cleveland yes our pipeline is full and really full in all the markets that we serve so weve been shifting through a number of potential acquisition both small and large through the first half of the year and obviously weve executed on a number of them the opportunities continue to be extremely strong and we are really excited about the potential not only in the marine industry but in the other industry that we serve and i just add on top of that probably the thing that gets me most excited is our ongoing opportunities that we have we expanded through acquisition over the past four or five years pretty regularly but as you’ve seen our organic growth and our expansions and to regional locations has improved along with the teams ability to execute on other areas of our capital allocation strategy including strategic capex to eliminate bottlenecks and also reduce labor cost has been put into play and those are all things that we have been preparing for really for the latter part of  and through  here and we are really looking forward to seeing those pieces continue to contribute along with our acquisitions operator and the next question comes from indiscernible with bank of america you may begin unidentified analyst i just want to follow up on the ma question can you just talk about your capacity to peruse further ma i think that the lpe acquisition was obviously a little bigger than ones you’ve done in the past can you just talk about the capacity you have going forward andy nemeth we have a lot of capacity one of the reasons that we went forward with our equity offering and the expansion of our credit facility in the first quarter was to really position ourselves to be able to take advantage of the strong pipeline that todd had referred to and so we had a lot  we had acquisitions in our sights kind of as we kind of moved through q and q certainly weve got tremendous opportunity with a full pipeline today to be able to continue to execute consistent with what weve done in the past and so well tell you that our view is that weve got ample dry powder to be able to continue on our strategic plan unidentified analyst and then just on the gross margin outlook for the rest of the year can you just give some color on how we should think about the labor market tightness that you’ve spoken about when we start to maybe lap that and then the input cost outlook and some of the labor efficiency initiatives that you have josh boone so well start to lap kind of the labor inefficiencies impact we saw in q that’s when we really started to feel the impact of that last year with the strong shipments we saw in q of last year so were lapping that from a comp standpoint so we got the benefit of that and also the investments weve made in capacity and strategic capex to abate those the labor impacts the tight labor markets so we should see the impact of that yearoveryear in q and q as we proceed throughout the rest of the year as far as the input cost commodity prices have ticked up a little bit and were seeing that but we don’t expect material impacts on the margin line associated with it unidentified analyst just for the back half of the year with that when you put that all together can we expect gross margin to be up slightly todd cleveland we would on yearoveryear basis unidentified analyst okay great thank you operator and our next question comes from darren wolfsenback with robert w baird you may begin darren wolfsenback good morning thanks for taking my questions as well andy nemeth good morning todd cleveland good morning darren wolfsenback my first question is just related to what youre hearing from your oem and other industry contacts in terms of dealer inventory levels and retail sell through todd cleveland this is todd ill take that one weve heard really nothing but positive coming out of the oes obviously theyve continued to add facilities to take care of retail demand and just this recently i think last week one week before announced further expansion on their side on the motorized side were seeing continued facility expansion to take care of retail demand and really if you take a look at the retail pullthroughs thus far through the statistics that we have were right on track for exceeding past trends as it relates to retail demand as far as keeping up or exceeding in the last couple of months that of a oem manufacturing on top of that i think the other delta that came into play is the canadian market has continued to strengthen as a result they were down significantly last year yearoveryear and their demands and retail demands has strengthened its a solid plus for things on the regional side darren wolfsenback great thanks and then just wanted to dig into your recent acquisition of wire design do you see any opportunities to get into wire harness manufacturing for other industries in addition to the marine market todd cleveland yes this is todd again we definitely do weve got over the last of the last year andahalf weve assembled a group of companies that actually we have intentions of synergizing and that one in particular kra which came in last year offers us the opportunity to definitely have the inroads to go into other markets obviously were going to be extremely supportive of the existing industries that the business is supporting currently but we believe there are some true opportunities to expand that in the months and years ahead darren wolfsenback great thanks for taking my questions andy nemeth thank you operator and our next question comes from tim conder with wells fargo you may begin tim conder thank you and congratulations gentlemen i apologize for the horse voice here a couple of items todd or andy whoever wants to take this last year there really wasnt a pause in the septemberoctober period you eluded to that it could be this year but given the ongoing strength of the market what would you see if you want to put a probability to it is there the potential where there might not be again not much of a pause this year todd cleveland i think thats definitely the case a lot depends on some of the retail numbers that come in on june and july here were anticipating them being strong i think what andy was alluding to is that from a yearoveryear comp standpoint even if you take a look at last years numbers they were up significantly for us so were anticipating those numbers to be up again this year i think what andy was referring to more was seasonality trends that we see patricks in extremely strong shipment that we see in usually q definitely think that as long as retail stays strong which we anticipate were definitely looking at a quarteroverquarter gain in line with what weve seen thus far this year andy nemeth tim this is andy ill just add a little bit more color as well last year augustseptember shipments were up  plus and  respectively we expect to see increased shipments i dont know that were going to see those type of numbers at this point were certainly planning and really working on capacity to be able to position ourselves well for that but i dont think were going to see those types of increases this year we do expect increase yearoveryear though tim conder okay helpful gentlemen and then given what youre seeing at this point and then starting on the new models youve built for rv and marine what type of general pricing increases are you able to get at this point todd cleveland yes tim this is todd we dont go out with just general price increases but we have passed along price increases related to raw material cost and also labor cost weve managed things in the partnership with the oes both on the marine and rv side in a way that we hope its a winwin for both of us but we did obviously and have like we normally do adjust pricing accordingly based on raw material and labor challenges that we are faced with tim conder okay and then todd you alluded too that youre going to be lapping here the labor cost increases and with the indiscernible that you put in place with capex and some of the programs how are you planning on a goforward basis here any additional programs measures to i guess get out even more in front of that and then in conjunction with that question do you anticipate any additional new geographic manufacturing shifts coming up here looking into  even out in the  or so todd cleveland yes i think first of all when you take a look at our labor situation i think were going to cap ongoing as long as theres expansion were going to have ongoing labor challenges that were going to have to face as a management team i think the initiatives that we took starting back almost two years ago from a talent engagement from a talent retention standpoint has started to take hold obviously made it significant investments and leadership within the organization that has been important for us to guide and get our principles and values spread across the organization on a softer side i think thats going to be the key for us to maintain and stay ahead of the labor game but i do think again theres a finite number of individuals that are in these areas and weve got to create the company of choice so to speak so that were getting the best talent and the talent that we need in order to be the best supplier that we can be for our customers from an overall expansion standpoint obviously we made some geographic expansions starting a little over a year andahalf ago in some areas and i do think that the oes will continue to spread their expansions into those regions honestly i would be surprised if anybody opens up a new hub in the years to come but it could happen but i think when you look across the country and the opportunity that we have as an organization we continue to deploy additional product lines into the regional hubs that serve not only the rv but the marine space and the manufacturing hub into having space to alleviate some of the pressures that were seeing here in the midwest and obviously those are things that we have under way that we continue to undertake tim conder okay and then lastly gentlemen as it relates to  you talk about capex  along with those plans should we anticipate capex as a percentage of revenue materially changing i guess looking more over the next two to three years i guess would be the time frame of that question josh boone this is josh no we would not expect capex as the percentage of sales to materially change we set out the year with a  million target in our prepared remarks we talked about thats our current estimate but we are prepared to flex that by additional  million with the strong demands were seeing in all of the primary markets right now i would say that were looking at  million to  million this year with the incremental  million specifically identified on our capacity expansions to make sure that were best positioned to handle the strength in the markets and to kind of come back and labor component of that too as far as ongoing   beyond again i wouldnt expect it to materially change as a percentage of sales and i wouldnt expect it to grow proportionally either so you would expect it potentially to decrease slightly as we grow revenues for those years and beyond tim conder okay thank you very much andy nemeth thank you josh boone thanks operator operator instructions our next question comes from steve ohara with sidoti you may begin stephen ohara hi good morning andy nemeth good morning todd cleveland good morning stephen ohara i just wanted to just go back to the marine market again just wondering it seems like the market has come off its bottom but the market itself doesnt appear to have grown away  rvs have and im just wondering is the thought that at some point you could see higher growth here or is it about being able to crosssell into other markets im just wondering what the long term strategy is in the marine when it appears to be a lower growth market thank you andy nemeth steve this is andy as it relates to our vision into the marine market its been growing at single to midsingle digit rates over the last several years we see again continued upside potential as it relates to that i think slow and steady growth has been our model really in all the markets that we serve and were wellpositioned to support that because we believe that we bring a nice value proposition so as we look into the marine market today its highly fragmented we think that our branding model and value proposition allows us great opportunity to continue to put together some great partnerships with the marine oems to be able to support them so we see strategic growth upside potential we see expansion opportunity potential to grow organically and then on top of that slow and steady growth in that particular space as it relates to just general industry growth we kind of think the overall value proposition provides a nice longterm view and platform for us to continue to execute on thats how were thinking about it and similar to the way that we look at our other markets stephen ohara okay did you say what your growth was relative to  i guess organic growth relative to the industries growth i know you guys do a pretty good job of growing above industry rates and some of the other categories is that true for marine or maybe you dont have the scale yet josh boone this is josh we dont break out organic growth by industry per se our marine revenues quadrupled but it was off a little based from last year a lot of that was acquisitiondriven as were really just filling the effect of leveraging these marine acquisitions that weve acquired over the last  to  months and so when on a consolidated basis organic revenues were up  so exceeding the market weighted average for us and we would expect that trend to spill over on the marine side now that weve acquired leisure product and bhe and we leveraged that platform to continue to execute on that like weve done on the rv side stephen ohara okay all right thank you very much operator and our next question comes from scott stember with cl king you may begin scott stember i guess just a followup question on the tax rate going forward i know its probably difficult to forecast what it will be just depending on option grants and when they actually are executed but is there a number that we could use from a modeling standpoint  seems to have been the rate going in past years but obviously so far this year were well below that maybe just give us a little sneak peek into what youre thinking josh boone yes scott this is josh obviously for the quarter we had a lot effective tax rate with the stock comp tech benefit associated with the option that  absent that we would have been able to slightly under  for the quarter and  in the quarter yeartodate as in any other exercise of options to get the stock comp benefit we would be out to anticipate  in the quarter for the remainder of the year scott stember got it its all i have thanks josh boone thanks scott andy nemeth thank you operator we have no further questions at this time i would like to return the presentation back over to julie ann kotowski julie ann kotowski thanks we appreciate
