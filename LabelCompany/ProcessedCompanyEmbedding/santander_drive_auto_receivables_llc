involves significant risks before you decide to invest we recommend that you carefully consider the following risk factors       you must rely for repayment only upon the issuing entitys assets which may not be sufficient to make full payments on your securities   your securities either represent interests solely in an issuing entity or indebtedness of an issuing entity the issuing entity does not have and is not permitted to have any significant assets or sources of funds other than the contracts and the amounts on deposit in certain other accounts held by the indenture trustee on the securityholders behalf your notes will not represent an interest in or obligation of us the originator or any other person we or the originator may have a limited obligation to repurchase some contracts under some circumstances as described in the applicable prospectus supplement distributions on any class of securities will depend solely on the amount and timing of payments and other collections in respect of the related contracts and any credit enhancement for the securities specified in the applicable prospectus supplement we cannot assure you that these amounts together with other payments and collections in respect of the related contracts will be sufficient to make full and timely distributions on your securities the securities and the contracts will not be insured or guaranteed in whole or in part by the united states or any governmental entity or unless specifically set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement by any provider of credit enhancement       the issuing entitys interest in the contracts could be defeated because the contracts will not be delivered to the issuing entity   the servicer or its custodian will maintain possession of the original contracts in tangible form or control of the authoritative copies of the contracts in electronic form if the servicer sells or pledges and delivers original contracts for the receivables to another party in violation of its obligations under the agreements for the securities this party could acquire an interest in the contract having a priority over the issuing entitys interest furthermore if the servicer becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding competing claims to ownership or security interests in the receivables could arise these claims even if unsuccessful could result in delays in payments on the securities if successful these claims could result in losses or delays in payment to you or an acceleration of the repayment of the securities       the issuing entitys security interest in the financed vehicles will not be noted on the certificates of title which may cause losses on your securities   upon the origination of a contract the originator takes a security interest in the financed vehicle by placing a lien on the title to the financed vehicle in connection with each contribution of contracts to the depositor the originator will assign its security interests in the financed vehicles to the depositor who will further assign them to the issuing entity finally the issuing entity will pledge its interest in the financed vehicles as collateral for the securities the lien certificates or certificates of title relating to the financed vehicles will not be amended or reissued to identify the issuing entity as the new secured party in the absence of an amendment or reissuance the issuing entity may not have a perfected security interest in the financed vehicles securing the contracts in some states we or the originator may be obligated to repurchase any contract sold to the issuing entity which did not have a perfected security interest in the name of the originator in the financed vehicle           we the servicer the originator or another entity may be required to purchase or repurchase as applicable any contract sold to the issuing entity as to which it failed to obtain or maintain a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle securing the contract all of these purchases and  table of contents           repurchases are limited to breaches that materially and adversely affect the interests of the issuing entity or the securityholders in the contract and are subject to the expiration of a cure period if the issuing entity has failed to obtain or maintain a perfected security interest in a financed vehicle its security interest would be subordinate to among others a bankruptcy trustee of the obligor a subsequent purchaser of the financed vehicle or a holder of a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle or a bankruptcy trustee of such holder if the issuing entity elects to attempt to repossess the related financed vehicle it might not be able to realize any liquidation proceeds on the financed vehicle and as a result you may suffer a loss on your investment in the securities       the failure of contracts to comply with consumer protection laws may result in losses on your investment   federal and state consumer protection laws regulate the creation collection and enforcement of consumer contracts such as the contracts these laws impose specific statutory liabilities upon creditors who fail to comply with their provisions although the liability of the issuing entity to the obligor for violations of applicable federal and state consumer laws may be limited these laws may make an assignee of a contract such as the issuing entity liable to the obligor for any violation by the lender under certain circumstances the liability of the issuing entity to the obligor for violations of applicable federal and state consumer protection laws may be limited by the applicable law in some cases this liability could affect an assignees ability to enforce its rights related to secured loans such as the contracts we or the originator may be obligated to repurchase from the issuing entity any contract that fails to comply with these legal requirements if we or the originator fails to repurchase that contract you might experience delays or reductions in payments on your securities see material legal aspects of the contracts  consumer protection laws in this prospectus       changes to federal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws and other restrictions of law may impede collection efforts or alter timing and amount of collections which may result in acceleration of or reduction in payment on your notes   if an obligor sought protection under federal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws a court could reduce or discharge completely the obligors obligations to repay amounts due on its contract as a result that contract would be written off as uncollectible you could suffer a loss if no funds are available from credit enhancement or other sources and finance charge amounts allocated to the notes are insufficient to cover the applicable default amount furthermore most states impose requirements and restrictions on foreclosure sales of vehicles and on obtaining deficiency judgments relating to such sales the issuing entity may not realize the full amount due on a contract because application of those requirements and restrictions may create delays during which the financed vehicle may suffer damage or loss the servicers credit and collection policy and the sale and servicing agreement do not require the servicer to force place collision and comprehensive insurance if the obligors fail to maintain such insurance       bankruptcy of the depositor or the originator could result in delays in payments or losses on your securities   the originator intends that each contribution of contracts to the depositor will be a valid transfer and assignment of the contracts to the depositor the depositor intends that its sale of the contracts to the issuing entity will be a valid transfer and assignment of the contracts to the issuing entity if the originator or the depositor were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case and a creditor or trusteeinbankruptcy of the depositor or the originator were to take the position that the sale of contracts by the originator to the depositor or by the depositor to the issuing entity as the case may be should instead be treated as a pledge of the contracts to secure a borrowing of the depositor or the originator delays in payments of collections on the contracts to you could occur if a court ruled in favor of any such trustee debtor or creditor the court could reduce the amount payable to the issuing  table of contents           entity which could result in losses in the securities if the transfer of contracts by the originator to the depositor or by the depositor to the issuing entity is treated as a pledge instead of a sale a tax or governmental lien on the property of the originator or the depositor as applicable arising before the transfer of the contracts to the issuing entity may have priority over the issuing entitys interest in those contracts if the transactions are treated as transfers the contracts would not be part of the originators or the depositors bankruptcy estate as applicable and would not be available to the depositors or the originators creditors       the originator the servicer and the depositor have limited obligations to the issuing entity and will not make payments on the securities   the originator the servicer the depositor and their affiliates are not obligated to make any payments to you on your securities the originator the servicer the depositor and their affiliates do not guarantee payments on the contracts or your securities however the originator and the depositor will make representations and warranties about the characteristics of the contracts if a representation or warranty made by the originator with respect to a contract is untrue or if the originator breaches a covenant with respect to a contract then we or the originator may be required to repurchase that contract if we or the originator fails to repurchase that contract you might experience delays andor reductions in payments on the securities in addition in some circumstances the servicer may be required to purchase contracts if the servicer fails to purchase contracts you might experience delays andor reductions in payments on your securities see the transaction documents  payments and distributions on the securities in this prospectus       interests of other persons in the contracts and financed vehicles could be superior to the issuing entitys interest which may result in reduced payments on your securities   the issuing entity could lose the priority of its security interest in a financed vehicle due to among other things liens for repairs or storage of a financed vehicle or for unpaid taxes of an obligor none of we the servicer the originator or any other entity will have any obligation to purchase or repurchase respectively a contract if these liens result in the loss of the priority of the security interest in the financed vehicle after the issuance of securities by the issuing entity generally no action will be taken to perfect the rights of the issuing entity in proceeds of any insurance policies covering individual financed vehicles or obligors therefore the rights of a third party with an interest in the proceeds could prevail against the rights of the issuing entity prior to the time the proceeds are deposited by the servicer into an account controlled by the trustee for the securities see material legal aspects of the contracts  security interests in the financed vehicles in this prospectus       commingling of assets by the servicer could reduce or delay payments on the securities   the servicer will be required to deposit all collections and proceeds of the contracts collected during each collection period into the collection account within two business days of receipt until these funds have been deposited into the collection account the servicer may use and invest these funds at its own risk and for its own benefit and will not segregate them from its own funds the indenture trustee may not have a perfected interest in these amounts and thus payment could be delayed or reduced if the servicer were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding further if the servicer were unable to remit such funds the securityholders might incur a loss  table of contents       extensions and deferrals of payments on contracts could increase the average life of the securities   in some circumstances the servicer may permit an extension on or deferral of payments due on contracts on a casebycase basis in addition the servicer may from time to time offer obligors an opportunity to defer payments any of these deferrals or extensions may extend the maturity of the contracts and increase the weighted average life of the securities the weighted average life and yield on your securities may be adversely affected by extensions and deferrals on the contracts however the servicer must purchase the contract from the issuing entity if any payment deferral of a contract extends the term of the contract beyond the latest final scheduled payment date for any class of related securities or breaches other tests described in the applicable prospectus supplement       the application of the servicemembers civil relief act may lead to delays in payment or losses on your securities   in some circumstances the servicemembers civil relief act as amended or similar state legislation may limit the interest payable on a contract during an obligors period of active military duty this legislation could adversely affect the ability of the servicer to collect full amounts of interest on a contract as well as to foreclose on an affected contract during and in certain circumstances after the obligors period of active military duty this legislation may thus cause delays and losses in payments to holders of the securities see material legal aspects of the contracts  servicemembers civil relief act in this prospectus       the absence of a secondary market for the securities could limit your ability to resell your securities   if you want to sell your securities you must locate a purchaser that is willing to purchase those securities the underwriters intend to make a secondary market for the securities the underwriters will do so by offering to buy the securities from investors who wish to sell however the underwriters will not be obligated to make offers to buy the securities and may stop making offers at any time in addition the prices offered if any may not reflect prices that other potential purchasers would be willing to pay were they to be given the opportunity there have been times in the past where there have been very few buyers of assetbacked securities and there may be these times again in the future as a result you may not be able to sell your securities when you want to do so or you may not be able to obtain the price that you wish to receive       you may not be able to exercise your rights as a securityholder directly   each class of securities of a given series will be initially represented by one or more certificates registered in the name of cede  co or any other nominee for the depository trust company set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and will not be registered in the names of the holders of the securities of such series or their nominees persons acquiring beneficial ownership interests in any series of securities may hold their interests through the depository trust company in the united states or clearstream bank société anonyme or the euroclear system in europe because of this unless and until definitive securities for such series are issued holders of such securities will not be recognized by the issuing entity or any trustee or indenture trustee as certificateholders or noteholders as the case may be until definitive securities are issued holders of such securities will only be able to exercise the rights of noteholders and certificateholders indirectly through the depository trust company and its participating organizations see the securities  bookentry registration global clearance settlement and tax documentation procedures in this prospectus       your share of possible losses may not be proportional   principal payments of the securities generally will be made to the holders of the securities sequentially so that no principal will be paid on any class of the securities until each class of securities with an earlier final scheduled  table of contents             payment date has been paid in full as a result a class of securities with a later maturity may absorb more losses than a class of securities with an earlier maturity   the ratings for the securities are limited in scope may not continue to be issued and do not consider the suitability of the securities for you   we will offer a class of securities only if that class receives the rating specified in the applicable prospectus supplement the rating considers only the likelihood that the issuing entity will pay interest on time and will ultimately pay principal in full or make full distributions of the outstanding principal balance of the security or the final scheduled payment date a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold the securities the rating agencies may revise or withdraw the ratings at any time without notice from the issuing entity the depositor or santander consumer ratings on the securities do not address the timing of distributions of principal of the securities prior to the applicable final scheduled payment date the ratings do not consider the prices of the securities or their suitability to a particular investor if a rating agency revises its rating or withdraws a rating no one has an obligation to provide additional credit enhancement or to restore the original rating    table of contents

the united states  table of contents      provides for level monthly payments which provide interest at the weighted average percentage rate and fully amortize the amount advanced under the contract toward the purchase price of the financed vehicle and any related costs over an original term to scheduled maturity specified in the applicable transaction document        is attributable to the purchase of and secured by a new or used automobile light duty truck van motorcycle or minivan        as of the applicable cutoff date has a remaining term to scheduled maturity specified in the applicable transaction document        is not more than  days delinquent on the related cutoff date and        satisfies any additional criteria specified in the applicable prospectus supplement      the depositor will not use any selection procedures in selecting the contracts for each contracts pool that are materially adverse to the securityholders of that series      the depositor will sell or transfer contracts having an aggregate outstanding principal balance specified in the applicable prospectus supplement as of the applicable cutoff date to the applicable issuing entity the purchase price paid by each issuing entity for each contract included in the issuing entity property of the issuing entity will reflect the outstanding principal balance of the contract as of the applicable cutoff date      additional information with respect to the contracts pool securing each series of securities will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement including to the extent appropriate the composition of the contracts the distribution of annual percentage rates the distribution by the states where the obligors reside and the portion of the contracts pool secured by new or used vehicles origination and servicing procedures      the following is a description of the origination underwriting and servicing of retail installment sales contracts by the originator as of the date of this prospectus the applicable prospectus supplement will describe any material changes to this information with respect to the origination underwriting and servicing of the pool of contracts transferred to the related issuing entity and will designate the entity acting as servicer with respect to that particular transaction      the originator originates or acquires contracts through a variety of origination channels across a spectrum of credit quality obligors nonprime contracts in general are expected to have higher loss rates and may have higher delinquency rates than contracts that represent the obligations of prime credit obligors origination contracts and calculation methods      the standard contract originated or purchased by the originator is a fully amortizing fixed level monthly payment contract which will amortize the full amount of the contract over its term assuming that the obligor does not pay any installment after its due date each contract provides for the allocation of payments according to the simple interest method of allocating a fixed level payment on an obligation between principal and interest pursuant to which the portion of such payment that is allocated to interest is equal to the product of the fixed rate of interest on such obligation multiplied by the unpaid principal balance multiplied by the period of time expressed as a fraction of a year based on the actual number of days in the calendar month and  days in the calendar year elapsed since the preceding payment under which the obligation was made and the remainder of such payment is allocable to principal  table of contents      under the simple interest method payments on contracts are applied first to interest accrued through the date immediately preceding the date of payment and then to unpaid principal accordingly if an obligor pays an installment before its due date the portion of the payment allocable to interest for the payment period will be less than if the payment had been made on the due date the portion of the payment applied to reduce the principal balance will be correspondingly greater and the principal balance will be amortized more rapidly than scheduled conversely if an obligor pays an installment after its due date the portion of the payment allocable to interest for the payment period will be greater than if the payment had been made on the due date the portion of the payment applied to reduce the principal balance will be correspondingly less and the principal balance will be amortized more slowly than scheduled      the contract term is determined by a number of factors which may include the age and mileage of the financed vehicle interest rates may be determined on the basis of the credit quality of the obligor andor the maximum rate which may be charged by law contracts that represent the obligations of nonprime credit obligors interest tend to have higher interest rates than contracts that represent the obligations of prime credit obligors contract origination channels      the originator primarily originates contracts by purchasing motor vehicle installment sales contracts from dealers pursuant to a dealer agreement between the originator and the dealer      in addition the originator may originate contracts from time to time through passthrough arrangements in place with third parties      each dealer agreement among other things sets out the guidelines and procedures of the purchasing and origination process these dealer agreements generally provide for the repurchase by the dealer of any contract for its outstanding principal balance plus accrued but unpaid interest if any representations or warranties made by the dealer relating to the contract are breached the representations and warranties typically relate to the origination of a contract and the security interest in the related financed vehicle and not to the collectability of the contract or the creditworthiness of the related obligor      under the pass through arrangements applications that do not meet the third partys underwriting criteria are directed to the originator who may approve the application for funding in most cases these pass through contracts are underwritten using the same processes and decision models as other types of receivables originated by the originator although the specific underwriting criteria and contract terms may vary among programs underwriting      credit underwriters have the ability to structure some contracts individually depending upon the risk profile of the obligor with particular emphasis on the following underwriting criteria i collateral type and quality ii loan to value ratio  ltv  iii cash down payment iv affordability payment to income and debt to income v obligor stability and vi term ordinarily contracts are approved based upon the originators pricing and origination guidelines but underwriters have limited ability to approve exceptions the total number of exceptions made by any one underwriter cannot exceed  of that underwriters monthly originations any exception to the underwriting guidelines must be approved by the underwriters supervisor credit risk management       overview      the originators credit risk management department is responsible for monitoring origination activities and portfolio performance and supporting senior operations management the department monitors and analyzes loan applicant and credit bureau data credit score information loan structures and pricing terms the department is responsible for developing the originators credit scorecards and monitoring their performance  table of contents      the credit risk management department monitors portfolio performance at a variety of levels including total company market and dealer the analysis of the results are the basis for ongoing changes to origination strategies including credit policy riskbased pricing programs and eventual changes to the scoring system the department also monitors adherence to underwriting guidelines       credit scoring      the originator utilizes a proprietary credit scoring system to support the credit decision process and to differentiate applicant credit risk based on this riskranking the originator determines the expected default rate for each applicant and is able to rank order credit risk accordingly which enables the originator to evaluate credit applications for approval and tailor loan pricing and structure      the credit scoring system was developed utilizing a statistical analysis of the originators consumer origination data pooled data purchased from the national credit bureaus and subsequent portfolio performance prior to fourth quarter  the originator did not use credit scoring to assess credit applications      the credit scoring system considers data contained in the applicants credit application and credit bureau report as well as the structure of the proposed contract and produces a statistical assessment of these attributes this assessment is used to segregate applicant risk profiles and determine whether risk is acceptable and the price the originator should charge for that risk the originators credit scorecards are monitored through comparison of actual versus projected performance by score while the originator employs a credit scoring system in the credit approval process credit scoring does not eliminate credit risk       pricing model      the originator utilizes a proprietary pricing model to develop riskbased pricing programs and credit policy subject to corporate goals and constraints including credit losses and profitability a score cutoff was introduced in the first quarter of  for applicants with the lowest scores where profit thresholds are not met applicants scoring above the cutoff are underwritten against the riskbased pricing programs       funding      completed contract packages are sent by the dealers to the originator key documentation is scanned to create electronic images and electronically forwarded to the originators centralized contract processing department the original documents are subsequently sent to an outsourced storage location and stored in a fire resistant vault      upon electronic receipt of contract documentation the contract processing department reviews the contract packages for proper documentation and regulatory compliance and completes the entry of information into the companys loan accounting system once cleared for funding the contract processing department electronically transfers funds to the dealer or issues a check upon funding of the contract the originator acquires a perfected security interest in the motor vehicle that was financed servicing       overview      santander consumer usa inc will be the servicer all servicing and processing for the contracts will be performed by the servicer the servicer will have the right to delegate certain servicing and processing responsibilities of the contracts to another entity pursuant to the applicable sale and servicing agreement the servicer will be responsible for billing collecting accounting and posting all payments received with respect to the contracts responding to obligor inquiries taking steps to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicles or other collateral coordinating the ongoing liquidation of repossessed collateral and generally monitoring each contract and the related collateral the servicing is closely integrated with the origination platform of the originator this results in the efficient exchange of information which aids both servicing and evaluation and modification of product design and underwriting criteria  table of contents       collections      collections are performed at the servicing center in dallas texas the servicing practices associated with nonprime contracts include i placing reminder calls to new obligors three days prior to the first three payment due dates ii attempting telephonic communication with all obligors one day after a missed payment iii making evening and weekend collection calls and iv continuing to make calls at least once a day until contact is made in cases where an obligor has broken a promise to make a payment on a certain date such obligor is called within a day if the collection department is unsuccessful in contacting an obligor by phone alternative methods of contact such as location gathering via references employers landlords credit bureaus or cross directories are pursued generally within one to ten days of the account becoming delinquent      the servicer uses monthly billing statements to serve as a reminder to obligors as well as an early warning mechanism in the event an obligor has failed to notify the servicer of an address change payments are received in the mail or through a lockbox in addition to mailing in payments obligors may make payments via the internet an interactive voice response system third party payment processing services and verbally with the originators customer service and collections staff credit and debit cards are also accepted      on a daily basis the servicers integrated servicing system automatically forwards accounts to its automated dialer as well as its standard collections system based upon risk and projected loss severity risk assessment directs several courses of action including delaying collection activity based upon the likelihood of self curing directing an account to our automated dialer or forwarding the account for acceleratedspecialty treatment ie bankruptcy repossessions impounded units skip tracing etc to assist in the collection process the servicers collection staff has the ability to access original contract documents through its imaging system as well as having the availability to offer a due date change deferment three within the life of the loan and in rare cases a hardship rewrite      the collection process is divided into stages early stage collections services contracts that are normally less than  days delinquent the servicer outsources servicing on a portion of contracts at the earliest stages of delinquency less than  days delinquent these obligors are then called by a predictive dialer once a live voice responds to the automated dialers call the system automatically transfers the call to a collector while simultaneously delivering the relevant account information to the collectors computer screen mid stage collections services contracts that are normally  to  days delinquent contracts within this stage are worked by an advanced collection unit that provides light skip work as well as enhanced negotiating skills the objective of mid stage collections is to limit the number of contracts that roll to late stage delinquency as well as to mitigate loss late stage collections services contracts that are normally greater than  days delinquent contracts within this stage are worked by the servicers most experienced collectors late stage collectors employ heavy skip tracing and negotiating skills to determine the collectability of the contract if the delinquency is not cured repossession of the vehicle may be recommended usually by the  th day of delinquency      at times the servicer in accordance with its servicing policies offers payment deferrals or extensions to obligors who have encountered temporary financial difficulty the collector reviews the obligors past payment history to assess the obligors desire and capacity to make future payments the servicer also utilizes an internally generated behavior score to aid the collector in making the decision the servicer currently utilizes an industrystandard deferment policy a collector must obtain a written or recorded acknowledgment from the obligor before granting a deferral no deferrals may be granted until at least six scheduled payments have been received under the related contract and thereafter only one extension not to exceed one month may be granted each  months no more than three extensions are permitted on any one contract exceptions to the deferral policy including hardship rewrites are limited and require management approval       chargeoff policy       repossessions contracts related to repossessed vehicles are charged off in the month during which the earliest of any of the following occurs a liquidation of the repossessed vehicle b  days following the vehicles repossession date and c  days of contractual delinquency the amount of the initial chargeoff shall be equal to the then current outstanding contract principal balance less i the sum of the proceeds from the disposition of the vehicle net of the costs incurred in repossession storing and disposing of the vehicle and ii an  table of contents estimated amount for warranty and insurance refunds to be received later the initial chargeoff may be adjusted for additional recoveries or chargeoffs to reflect the actual proceeds received from rebates or the cancellation of outstanding insurance policies andor extended service contracts       bankruptcies if a notice of bankruptcy with respect to a contract is received the contract will be charged off at the time described in the next sentence in an amount equal to the current outstanding principal balance of the account at the time of the notice the chargeoff will be made upon the earlier to occur of a the month in which the borrower is  days contractually past due or b receipt of notice of the results of the bankruptcy proceeding indicating that a chargeoff or adjustment for a cram down is appropriate any notice of the result of a bankruptcy proceeding received after the contract is chargedoff will result in the reinstatement of the contract under the new terms or the recovered vehicle being sold following repossession as appropriate the resulting writebacks will be treated as recoveries       skips a skip an account for which the servicer has been unsuccessful in locating either the obligor or the financed vehicle charged off in an amount equal to the then current outstanding principal balance of the contract in the month the account becomes  days contractually delinquent if continued collection efforts result in subsequent contact with the obligor or the financed vehicle the financed vehicle is repossessed and sold and proceeds from the disposition of the collateral net of the costs incurred in the repossessing storing and disposing of the vehicle andor rebates from the cancellation of the outstanding insurance policies andor extended service contracts are recorded as recoveries       thefts or collisions theft or collision accounts are charged off upon the earlier to occur of a receipt of proceeds from an obligors insurance policy or b the month in which the account becomes contractually  days delinquent the chargeoff is equal to the then current outstanding balance of the contract insurance proceeds received after an account is chargedoff are recorded as recoveries      contracts are placed in nonaccrual status when they are greater than  days delinquent accrued and unpaid interest is reversed at the time the contract is placed in nonaccrual status chargedoff contracts are pursued for any deficiencies by the servicer until such time as it is judged that no further recoveries can be effected the servicer has the ability to establish payment schedules for deficiencies andor negotiate lump sum settlements of deficiencies however the servicer will be subject to certain limitations in the sale and servicing agreement with respect to any modifications of the contracts       repossessions      repossessions are subject to prescribed legal procedures which include peaceful repossession one or more obligor notifications a prescribed waiting period prior to disposition of the repossessed automobile and return of personal items to the obligor some jurisdictions provide the obligor with reinstatement or redemption rights repossessions are handled by independent repossession firms managed by repossessions consolidator companies contracted by the servicer all repossessions other than those relating to bankrupt accounts or previously chargedoff accounts must be approved by a collections manager upon repossession and after any prescribed waiting period the repossessed automobile is sold at auction the proceeds from the sale of the automobile at auction and any other recoveries are credited against the balance of the contract auction proceeds from sale of the repossessed vehicle and other recoveries are usually not sufficient to cover the outstanding balance of the contract and the resulting deficiency is chargedoff the services pursues collection of deficiencies when it deems such action to be appropriate      the decision to repossess a vehicle is influenced by many factors such as previous contract history reasons for delinquency and cooperation of the obligor as part of the collection process all practical means of contacting the obligor are attempted if at any point a collector feels that there is little or no chance of establishing contact with the obligor or that the obligor will not make the required payments the collector will submit such contract for repossession all contracts submitted are evaluated by collection supervisors to determine if additional followup work is needed prior to repossession if the collection supervisors recommend repossession those contracts are sent to the special collections department who makes one more attempt to contact the obligor to ensure that repossession is absolutely necessary if no progress is made then the account is assigned for repossession the decision to repossess will generally be made when the loan becomes approximately  days delinquent  table of contents      once the decision to repossess a vehicle is made the account is referred to an outside agency that handles the actual repossession most state laws require that the obligor be sent a notice of intent to sell which informs the obligor of the lenders intent to sell the repossessed vehicle the various states provide for a period of time generally  to  days during which the obligor may have the right depending on the applicable statute to either reinstate the contract by making all past due payments and paying the repossession and storage expenses of the vehicle or by paying the contract in full if the obligor does not exercise his right to reinstate the contract or redeem the vehicle as provided by the applicable statute the vehicle is sold at public auction or at a private sale prior to the sale a repossessed vehicle undergoes evaluation and if necessary extensive reconditioning is performed in order to maximize recovery value the vehicle is usually sold within  to  days after being repossessed after the notice of intent to sell expiration date applications are made for rebates on any extended warranty or life accident and health insurance policies that may have been financed as part of the vehicle purchase       perfection of security interests      each contract contains a sale assignment with a clause granting the originator a security interest in the related financed vehicle in each state in which the originator does business a security interest is perfected by noting the secured partys interest on the financed vehicles certificate of title santander consumer is or drive fs was recorded as lienholder on the financed vehicle titles the dealer is required to complete the title work and take all the steps required to perfect the originators security interest the contract is subject to repurchase by the originator if the title is not registered in the name of the originator or the originators security interest is not perfected      the servicers quality control procedures include a title tracking system used to review and track title processing by dealers and state authorities until such time as the certificate of title has been received       insurance      initially all of the contracts owned by the issuing entity are covered by physical damage insurance policies maintained by the obligors and the originator is named as loss payee the servicer does not use forceplaced insurance if an obligor fails to maintain any required insurance since obligors may choose their own insurers to provide the required coverage the specific terms and conditions of their policies may vary       prior securitization transactions      the servicers specific servicing policies and practices may change over time none of the securitization transactions of drive fs the predecessor of santander consumer or santander consumer have experienced early amortizations servicer defaults or events of default certain contract performance triggers relating to net losses extensions and delinquencies and financial covenants in certain securitization transactions sponsored by drive fs that were negotiated privately with insurers have been breached but all such breaches have been waived andor cured andor the triggers or covenants have been modified neither santander consumer nor the issuing entity can guarantee that there will not be any breaches of performance triggers early amortizations servicer defaults or events of default in the future prefunding arrangement      to the extent provided in the applicable prospectus supplement for a series of securities the related transfer agreement or indenture may provide for a prefunding arrangement which will be limited to a period not to exceed twelve months under the prefunding arrangement the related issuing entity commits to purchase additional contracts from the depositor following the date on which the related securities are issued with respect to a series of securities the prefunding arrangement will require that any subsequent contracts transferred to the issuing entity conform to the requirements and conditions in the related transfer agreement including all of the same eligibility criteria as the initial contracts if a prefunding arrangement is utilized in connection with the issuance of a series of securities the servicer will establish an account known as the prefunding account in the name of the indenture trustee for the benefit of the securityholders up to  of the proceeds received from the sale of the securities may be deposited into the prefunding account on the related closing date and thereafter funds will be released on one or  table of contents more occasions during a specified period to purchase subsequent contracts from the depositor upon each conveyance of subsequent contracts to the applicable issuing entity an amount equal to the purchase price paid by the depositor to the originator for the subsequent contracts will be released from the prefunding account and paid to the depositor if funds remain in the prefunding account at the end of the prefunding period those funds will be applied to prepay the securities in the manner set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement amounts on deposit in the prefunding account may be invested in eligible investments information regarding the subsequent contracts will be included under item  in a current report filed by the issuing entity on form k with the sec pursuant to the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act       the utilization of a prefunding arrangement for a series of securities is intended to improve the efficiency of the issuance of the securities and the sale of the contracts to the related issuing entity through the incremental delivery of the applicable contracts on the closing date and during a specified period following the closing date for that series of securities prefunding arrangements allow for a more even accumulation of the contracts by the originator and the issuance of a larger principal amount of securities than would be the case without a prefunding arrangement      you should be aware that the initial contracts and the subsequent contracts may be originated using credit criteria different from the criteria applied to the contracts disclosed in the applicable prospectus supplement and may be of a different credit quality and seasoning the credit quality of the subsequent contracts may vary as a result of increases or decreases in the credit quality of the related obligors within the predefined acceptable range which variations could impact the performance of the overall pool of contracts the portfolio of initial contracts may also be subject to greater seasoning than the subsequent contracts due to the length of time elapsed from the dates of origination of those contracts and the sale of those contracts to the related issuing entity accordingly less historical performance information may be available with respect to the subsequent contracts moreover following the transfer of subsequent contracts to the applicable issuing entity the characteristics of the entire pool of contracts included in the issuing entity property may vary from those of the contracts initially transferred to the issuing entity maturity and prepayment considerations      the weighted average life of the notes and the certificates of any series will generally be influenced by the rate at which the principal balances of the contracts are paid which payments may be in the form of scheduled payments or prepayments each contract is prepayable in full by the obligor at any time some contracts may require the obligor to pay a prepayment penalty if the obligor prepays all or a portion of the contracts full and partial prepayments on motor vehicle contracts included in the issuing entity property of an issuing entity will be paid or distributed to the related securityholders on the next payment date following the collection period in which they are received to the extent that any contract included in the issuing entity property of an issuing entity is prepaid in full whether by the obligor or as the result of a purchase by the servicer or a repurchase by the originator or otherwise the actual weighted average life of the contracts included in the issuing entity property of the issuing entity will be shorter than a weighted average life calculation based on the assumptions that payments will be made on schedule and that no prepayments will be made weighted average life means the average amount of time until the entire principal amount of a contract is repaid full prepayments may also result from liquidations due to default receipt of proceeds from theft physical damage credit life and credit disability insurance policies repurchases by the depositor as a result of the failure of a contract to meet the criteria set forth in the related transaction documents as a result of a breach of covenants with respect to the contracts or purchases made by the servicer as a result of a breach of a representation warranty or covenant made by it related to its servicing duties in the related transaction documents in addition early retirement of the securities may be effected by the servicer exercising its option to purchase the remaining contracts included in the issuing entity property of the issuing entity on any payment date as of which the pool balance after giving effect to the principal payments and distributions otherwise to be made on that payment date has declined to or below the percentage of the original pool balance specified in the applicable prospectus supplement see the transaction documents  termination in this prospectus      the rate of full prepayments by obligors on the contracts may be influenced by a variety of economic social and other factors these factors include the unemployment rate servicing decisions seasoning of loans destruction of vehicles by accident loss of vehicles due to theft sales of vehicles market interest rates the availability of alternative financing and restrictions on the obligors ability to sell or transfer the financed vehicle  table of contents securing a contract without the consent of the servicer any full prepayments or partial prepayments applied immediately will reduce the average life of the contracts      the originator cannot make a prediction as to the actual prepayment rates that will be experienced on the contracts included in the issuing entity property of any issuing entity in either stable or changing interest rate environments securityholders of each series will bear all reinvestment risk resulting from the rate of prepayment of the contracts included in the issuing entity property of the related issuing entity note factors and other information      each class of notes will be assigned a note factor consisting of a sixdigit decimal which the servicer will compute each month indicating the principal balance for each class of notes as a fraction of the initial principal balance of the corresponding class of notes the note factor for each class of notes will be  as of the closing date thereafter each note factor will decline to reflect reductions in the principal balance of each class of notes as a noteholder your share of the principal balance of a particular class of notes is the product of  the original denomination of your note and  the applicable class note factor      under the indenture the securityholders will receive monthly reports concerning the payments received on the motor vehicle contracts the aggregate contracts balance the note factors and various other items of information see reports to securityholders in this prospectus pool factor and pool information      for each issuing entity the pool factor will be a sixdigit decimal which the servicer will compute each month indicating the pool balance at the end of the month as a fraction of  the original pool balance of contracts as of the initial cutoff date plus  the original pool balance of any subsequent contracts added to the issuing entity property as of the applicable subsequent cutoff date the pool factor will be  as of the closing date thereafter the pool factor will decline to reflect reductions in the pool balance the amount of a securityholders pro rata share of the pool balance for a given month can be determined by multiplying the original denomination of the holders security by the pool factor for that month      with respect to each issuing entity the noteholders and certificateholders of record will receive monthly reports from the trustee or indenture trustee as applicable concerning payments received on the contracts the pool balance the pool factor and other relevant information the depository trust company  dtc  will supply these reports to securityholders in accordance with its procedures since owners of beneficial interests in a global security of a given series will not be recognized as noteholders and certificateholders of that series dtc will not forward monthly reports to those owners copies of monthly reports may be obtained by owners of beneficial interests in a global security by a request in writing addressed to the trustee or indenture trustee as applicable noteholders and certificateholders of record during any calendar year will be furnished information for tax reporting purposes not later than the latest date permitted by federal andor state law see the securities  statements to securityholders in this prospectus use of proceeds      the net proceeds from the sale of securities of a given series will be applied by the depositor to  purchase the contracts from the originator  pay the fees of credit enhancement providers if applicable  deposit certain amounts to the prefunding account and to fund any other collateral accounts  pay other expenses in connection with the issuance of the securities and  repay certain warehouse debt any
