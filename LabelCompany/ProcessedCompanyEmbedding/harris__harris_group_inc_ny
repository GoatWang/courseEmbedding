results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the companys  consolidated financial statements and notes thereto cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements this annual report on form k contains forwardlooking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties these forwardlooking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations estimates and projections about the company our current and prospective portfolio investments our industry our beliefs and our assumptions words such as anticipates expects intends plans will may continue believes seeks estimates would could should targets projects and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report involve risks and uncertainties including statements as to our future operating results our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies the impact of investments that we expect to make our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives our expected financings and investments the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital and the timing of cash flows if any from the operations andor monetization of our positions in our portfolio companies these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forwardlooking statements including without limitation an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies a contraction of available credit andor an inability to access the equity markets could impair our investment activities interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results particularly if we elect to use leverage as a material part of our investment strategy currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than us dollars and the risks uncertainties and other factors we identify in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in our other filings with the sec although we believe that the assumptions on which these forwardlooking statements are based are reasonable any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and as a result the forwardlooking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate important assumptions include our ability to originate new investments certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital in light of these and other uncertainties the inclusion of a projection or forwardlooking statement in this annual report on form k should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved these risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k background and overview we incorporated under the laws of the state of new york in august  in  we completed an initial public offering ipo in  we divested all of our assets except otisville biotech inc and became a financial services company with the investment in otisville as the initial focus of our business activity in  we registered as an investment company under the  act commencing operations as a closedend nondiversified investment company in  we elected to become a business development company bdc subject to the provisions of sections  through  of the  act we have historically identified and invested in transformative companies enabled by what we believed was disruptive science more recently we have focused on investing in transformative companies in precision health and medicine we then provided strategic operational and management resources and creative financial solutions to these companies while we will continue to provide such resources to our existing portfolio companies including our precision health and medicine companies our future new investments will be focused on what we believe are significantly undervalued small publicly traded companies where we believe we can positively impact the business and valuation through constructive activism we believe we combine new perspectives with the historical knowledge and experience of managing the current portfolio we believe these complementary sets of experiences and skills in investment management and in working with management teams to build businesses can be a foundation for future growth we believe we will be able to generate income and grow net asset value per share for shareholders over shorter more predictable timeframes than those we have experienced over the past several years while there are multiple fund managers that invest in smaller publicly traded companies we believe that these managers are often not able or interested to actively engage with such companies we believe our expertise and focus on constructive activism could be an attractive complement to other investors in the space our new simplified structure and focus could lead to partnerships or other opportunities we believe that the universe of potential partners on this strategy is substantially larger than those focused on privately held investments we believe we will be in a strong position to seek these strategic partnership opportunities with the current and future assets of our company we believe we provide four core benefits to our shareholders first our goforward investment strategy offers investors the opportunity to leverage our experience extensive diligence and active portfolio management in what we believe are significantly undervalued publicly traded companies that may be difficult to replicate on an individual basis second we provide shareholders with access to an existing privately held portfolio of disruptive companies that we believe may yield significant returns on invested capital in the future third we provide access for accredited investors to coinvest with us in our portfolio companies when we acquire preemptive rights and either lack sufficient capital to fully exercise those rights or otherwise determine that such investment is not appropriate for us fourth we are able to invest opportunistically in multiple types of securities to take advantage of market inefficiencies proposals to withdraw election to be treated as a bdc and change of corporate name we recently filed a definitive proxy statement proposing that the company obtain shareholder approval to withdraw its election to be treated as a bdc and to change its name from harris  harris group inc to  degree capital corp  concurrent with the withdrawal of the election we would immediately register as a closedend investment company hereinafter a registered closedend fund as a registered closedend fund we would remain subject to many of the same provisions of the  act that we are subject to as a bdc we are proposing to convert from a bdc to a registered closedend fund because we believe that certain provisions of corporate law and the  act will enable us to operate with a lower expense ratio we believe this change will increase returns to investors while allowing us to maintain a comparable investment strategy such provisions include less frequent and less complex reports filed with the sec and exemption of registered closedend funds from section b of the sarbanesoxley act we currently expect that the transition from a bdc to a registered closedend fund will enable us to reduce our annual operating expenses attributable to regulatory and compliance requirements our priority with the proposed name change is to reflect the focus of our future business and to provide the opportunity to rebrand the firm initially  will be focused on shepherding the existing portfolio of investments to maximize returns with what we believe will be less regulatory burden and expense to shareholders than in a bdc structure s future business will be focused on making decisions that are designed to generate income and grow net asset value per share for shareholders over shorter more predictable timeframes toward this goal and as discussed above  will focus on investing in and providing valueadd assistance through constructive activism to what management believes are substantially undervalued small publicly traded companies that have potential for aggressive growth our goal is that the result of our constructive activism leads to a reversal in direction for the share prices of these investee companies ie a degree turn review of  during  we continued to take steps to position the company for potential future growth we believe a number of accomplishments including those of our privately held portfolio companies during the year have the potential to contribute to this goal these steps and accomplishments include we increased our investment income by  percent and decreased our net operating loss by  percent during  as compared with  we decreased our operating expenses for the third consecutive year additionally in  and pending approval from shareholders we are positioned to significantly reduce our net operating loss primarily through the withdrawal of our election to be treated as a bdc and transition to a registered closedend fund we announced changes in our business that we believe will enable us to generate income and grow net asset value per share for shareholders over shorter more predictable timeframes than those we have experienced over the past several years more specifically our goforward focus will be on investing in and providing valueadd assistance through constructive activism to what management believes are substantially undervalued small publicly traded companies that have potential for aggressive growth our goal is that the result of our constructive activism leads to a reversal in direction for the share prices of these investee companies thereby creating value for our shareholders we paid off all of our outstanding obligations associated with the loan facility with

companies cambrios technologies corporation and ultora inc completed auctions of their respective assets by a trustee appointed to conduct such liquidations for the benefit of creditors we did not receive any proceeds from the liquidation of assets of either company senova systems inc sold substantially all of its assets to an undisclosed buyer for an upfront payment and potential future milestone payments even if all of the milestone payments are received in full we do not expect to recover our cost basis of approximately  million the company received proceeds of  as repayment of the principal and accrued interest of its outstanding bridge notes of senova systems the values of public equities particularly those of microcapitalization companies are highly volatile the price per

company continues to hold  shares of common stock and  warrants to purchase common stock of enumeral biomedical holdings even though financings of some of our portfolio companies may have occurred at increases in price per share from prior rounds of financing such increases in value may not be reflected in full in our values owing to other rights and preferences afforded to investors in those rounds of financing this challenge in part led to a decrease in our net asset value per share during  ipos of small companies are difficult to complete and when they are completed they often occur at valuations lower than publicly traded comparable companies and rounds of private financing the downturn in the oil and gas sector negatively affected the business operations of at least one of our portfolio companies produced water absorbents inc  outlook we have three core initiatives that we believe will continue to position us to generate returns for stockholders through appreciation in our net asset value stock buybacks and dividends  we will continue to cultivate our maturing companies that have the potential to generate substantial returns we will also continue to cultivate our focus on precision health and medicine through interome inc renamed halelife corporation in   we will continue to reduce our net operating loss defined as our investment income less our expenses our net operating loss decreased by  percent over the period of time from  through  we believe we can materially reduce this loss further in  through a reduction in our expenses enabled primarily by the withdrawal of our election to be treated as a bdc and transition to a registered closedend fund subsequent to shareholder approval we will also continue to seek to increase substantially the shortterm income generated from existing and new investments to offset our operating expenses and potentially generate additional cash flows for shareholders of the company this reduction in net operating loss will permit our shareholders to realize more of the value of our portfolio as it matures in the coming years  we will execute on a strategy for future new investments that will focus on what we believe are significantly undervalued small publicly traded companies where we have the potential to positively impact the business and valuation through constructive activism we will also more actively employ constructive activism in publicly traded positions currently in our portfolio namely adesto technologies corporation and enumeral biomedical holdings inc as well as positions that become publicly traded from our existing privately held portfolio of investments reduction of net operating loss during  we reduced our net operating loss from approximately  million to  million this
