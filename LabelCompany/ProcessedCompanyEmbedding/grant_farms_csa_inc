couldnt be easier and my dropoff location is very near my home i feel good about supporting local farmers and have a great respect for the work that everyone does and the care they take at gff”— pattylocalharvestorg home » community » internshipsinternshipsgrant farms csa located northwest of fort collins colorado is a certified organic farm that grows over  varieties of vegetables and fruit in addition to raising chickens pigs turkeys ducks and geese  the farm familyowned and approximately  acres supports a large community supported agriculture csa program and is an avid promoter of local food systems that are environmentally socially and economically sustainable  our goal is to continue our own diversification and to grow the csa culture in our region so that even more consumers and farmers can reap the health economic and social rewards of a deep connection to where their food comes from or goes to an intern who commits to grant farms csa has the opportunity to learn a variety of skills and be offered a window onto the changing united states food system and the effort it takes to make those changes  we believe strongly that education is a key to fundamentally changing attitudes about food and farming in the united states  we also believe in the necessity of training and encouraging a new generation of farmers as well as environmentally and socially aware consumers so while we’ll expect interns to work hard and conscientiously we also expect ourselves to provide a valuable and enjoyable chance to expand one’s experience and perspective internship positions will last  months aprildecember  we have  internship opportunities for  interns will rotate between different farm duties every  months so they will get a strong understanding of all areas of the farm  we will have interns work in the following areas gardening prep design planting agriculture irrigation soil preparation  conservation harvesting orchard and vineyard care and maintenance pruning feb irrigation april harvesting sept animal care feeding chickens hens pigs goats sheep collecting washing  packing eggs csa packing preparation  packing of produce herbs and products packing shed management csa distribution distribution of produce boxes and other products to customers customized projects patios gazebos  solar project community organization  leadership all positions are workbased educational opportunities that adhere to the philosophy that the best way to learn is by doing what follows is an approximation of the areas you should expect to work in we want interns to experience the variety of work and develop the skills necessary for operating a farm butthis is a farm that exists in reality and you should also expect your experience to be fluid rather than strictly regimented  flexibility is a key attribute of any successful intern education in addition to field work interns will participate in classroom sessions two mornings a month during their term these sessions may have to do with permaculture principles community living specific topics raised in the field or general group discussions around issues of sustainable agriculture details length of internship it is required that you stay through the entire season including the planting and harvest seasons starting midapril and the csa season june december housing living on the farm is available and encouraged  however this is not required hours per week  during apriloctober  days perweek  during the winter stipend month plus room and partial board for those living on the farm month for those living off farm produce all interns will receive produce from the farm trial period all interns are subject to a two week trial period and review requirements while some previous farm experience is preferred it is not required however all applicants should be committed to the farming ethic and its demands to rise early be on time and ready to work in all types of weather including wind rain snow and summer heat that can reach  degrees part of farming is that some days will be longer and the work heavier than others  again flexibility is important as is having a great deal of energy and drive interns should possess the physical ability to work daily with hands wrist and back and be able to lift  pounds regularly excellent people skills and initiative are essential as you will interact with a variety of people each day knowing spanish is a plus as we have many spanishspeaking workers grant farms csa like many farms has a culture unto itself that operates within the larger framework of the farming ethic thus in addition to working hard for long hours we also like to have fun by getting together to cook and eat amazing food share ideas and discover what makes and keeps us connected finding a good match between what our farm offers and the needs and expectations of an intern are paramount  to that end we ask that if you have interest in an internship position with grant farms csa
