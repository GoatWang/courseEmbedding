systems for a versatile electric bicycle that is configured to be easily adapted to accommodate various needs and requirements in certain embodiments the foregoing may provide features andor models that are configured to be easily adapted to accommodate parts of varying dimensions different seating configurations andor particular laws and regulations of different jurisdictions description crossreference to related applications  this application is a continuation of pct application no pctus filed sep   which claims the benefit of us provisional application no  filed sep   each of the foregoing applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety background   field  embodiments relate to the field of bicycles and in particular to improved designs for versatile electric bicycles   description  with the development of new technologies various types and kinds of electric bicycles are available today that can operate on electric andor manual power many different types of electric bicycles are available and comprise various types of parts such as motors and batteries customized for different laws and regulations of each jurisdiction most electric bicycles are quite particular and lack compatibility or flexibility for example a certain electric bicycle can be restricted to be used in conjunction with certain parts certain configurations andor within certain jurisdictions only in other words the electric bicycle industry lacks any standard or base model that can easily be adapted to accommodate different regulations different parts andor different configurations further the same electric bicycle may be considered by law a bicycle a moped a motor assisted cycle or a motorcycle depending on jurisdiction and specification the most common jurisdictional variations are total power permitted top speed permitted and whether the motor is controlled by a hand throttle or by pedal input summary  advancements in technology make it possible to develop systems of a versatile electric bicycle that are adaptable to accommodate different parts including motors and batteries seat configurations and laws of different jurisdictions  in one embodiment a system for controlling an electric bicycle having a motor comprises a user access point unit configured to receive a user input for controlling the electric bicycle and an electric bicycle computing unit configured to control performance characteristics of the electric bicycle the electric bicycle computing unit may control the electric bicycle based on the received user input such that the performance characteristics of the electric bicycle comply with regulations of a first jurisdiction encompassing a current location of the electric bicycle in one embodiment the electric bicycle computing unit may communicate with a main computing system which maintains a regulations database to retrieve the regulations of the first jurisdiction encompassing the current location of the electric bicycle and automatically configure the electric bicycle to comply with the retrieved regulations in another embodiment the user access point unit may communicate with a main computing system which maintains a regulations database to retrieve the regulations of the first jurisdiction encompassing the current location of the electric bicycle and transmit the retrieved regulations to the electric bicycle computing unit and electric bicycle computing unit may automatically configure the electric bicycle to comply with the regulations transmitted by the user access point unit  in some embodiments the current location of the electric bicycle may be automatically determined without any user input based on location information provided by a gps module configured to determine location information alternatively in other embodiments the current location of the electric bicycle may be determined based on the user input specifying a location  in some embodiments the user access point unit may allow the user to specify one or more control parameters for controlling the electric bicycle the one or more control parameters may be one or more of i pedal assist or power on demand modes of power application ii a power output of the motor iii a top speed of the electric bicycle iv a maximum torque of the motor and v a brake on or off status  in some embodiments the electric bicycle computing unit may detect a change in the current location of the electric bicycle causing the current location to be encompassed by a second jurisdiction different from the first jurisdiction and automatically configure the electric bicycle to comply with regulations of the second jurisdiction  in some embodiments the electric bicycle may further comprise power control module for controlling the power output of the motor of the electric bicycle a gps module for detecting a current location of the electric bicycle a speed detection module for detecting a current speed of the electric bicycle a navigation module for providing directions to the user andor a battery level detection module for monitoring a current battery level by communicating with one or more battery sensors  in some embodiments the user input may include user selection of a riding mode specifying how the electric bicycle is to be used based on the user selection the electric bicycle computing unit may control the electric bicycle according to the selected riding mode for example  in a case that the riding mode is a bicycle mode the electric bicycle computing unit turns off the motor of the electric bicycle such that the electric bicycle is driven solely by pedaling  in a case that the riding mode is a moped mode the electric bicycle computing unit caps the performance of the motor of the electric bicycle based on the regulations of the first jurisdiction and  in a case that the riding mode is an offroadonly mode the electric bicycle computing unit allows the motor of the electric bicycle to perform in an uninhibited manner  in some embodiments the electric bicycle computing unit may be configured to unlock the electric bicycle when a valid connection is established between the electric bicycle computing unit and lock the electric bicycle when the valid connection is terminated  in some embodiments an electric bicycle may comprise a frame and a side bag having a semirigid outer shell the side bag may be connected to the frame with an elastic material that holds the shell tight to the frame when the side bag is not full and holds the shell tight to the cargo inside the side bag when the side bag is full  in some embodiments the side bag is waterproof cut resistant permanently fixed to the frame andor has one or more additional pockets for holding batteries controllers bicycle locks andor helmets in some embodiments a bag or compartment for holding one or more batteries may comprise a connector mechanism for connecting at least one battery of said one or more batteries to the electric bicycle such that the motor is powered by said at least one battery brief description of the drawings  the foregoing and other features aspects and advantages are

presented herein is not intended to be interpreted in any limited or restrictive manner simply because it is being utilized in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments furthermore embodiments may comprise several novel features no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes or which is essential to practicing the embodiments herein described  the disclosure herein provides improved systems for a versatile electric bicycle that is flexible and easily adaptable to accommodate various needs and requirements in general most electric bicycles available today are restricted andor designed to be used with particular parts such as motors andor batteries further most electric bicycles are confined to a particular seating configuration andor are not easily transferable across different jurisdictions due to varying regulations and laws that control the electric bicycle industry however the embodiments of a versatile electric bicycle disclosed herein provide standard features andor models that are configured to be easily adapted to accommodate parts of varying dimensions different seating configurations andor particular laws and regulations of different jurisdictions further due to its flexibility embodiments of an electric bicycle disclosed herein are durable and timeless as the motor battery andor other parts of the electric bicycle can be easily upgraded and replaced  the term “electric bicycle” used in the present disclosure may refer to any of electric bicycles electric assist bicycles mopeds and other “limited use vehicles” as defined by law for example a two or threewheeled cycle that can go faster than  mph and reach a top speed of  mph however the term is not limited to such examples and may include other similar devices currently existing or to be developed in the future frame design  in an embodiment an electric bicycle comprises an ergonomically designed frame in some embodiments the electric bicycle comprises a stepthrough frame wave seat configuration  in general electric bicycles can either be powered manually by pedaling or electrically by an electric motor when an electric bicycle is powered by the electric motor the rider may prefer to sit lower and further back for a more comfortable position while cruising also it may be preferable for the rider to be able to lay his or her feet flat on the ground when the electric bicycle is stopped alternatively a rider may choose to manually pedal the electric bicycle in some situations such as when the batteries are out of power or when the motor is not providing enough power andor speed when pedaling a rider may prefer to sit or stand substantially above the pedals for a more dynamic riding configuration as such due to differences in physical action of the two options different riding andor seating positions can be preferred depending on how the electric bicycle is being powered  in an embodiment an electric bicycle can have one or more seating positions that can be selected by the rider to accommodate different seating preferences figs ag illustrate an example of an embodiment of an electric bicycle with multiple seating positions or a wave seat configuration in the depicted embodiment an electric bicycle comprises multiple seating positions including at least position a  position b  and position c   position a  is relatively low and is positioned away from the front of the bicycle the pedals  are generally located further forward than the seat position position a  can be selected when the electric motor is powering the electric bicycle although it may be selected for manual pedaling as well when the electric bicycle is in position a  a rider can sit back in a cruising position as the electric motor powers the bicycle also in some embodiments position a  is sufficiently low as to allow a rider to rest the riders feet flat on the ground when the bicycle is not moving  position c  is higher in height and is closer to the front of the bicycle compared to position a  when a rider is actively pedaling the electric bicycle the user may select position c  of the seating positions this allows for the rider to sit or stand substantially above the pedals  to allow for more power and a more dynamic riding position  position b  is between position a  and position c  both in height and in distance from the front of the bicycle position b  can be selected depending on the personal preference of the rider andor riding condition such as the steepness of terrain  in other embodiments any number of seating positions that differ in height and in distance from the front of the bicycle may be selected a plurality of seating positions may accommodate riders of different heights andor with different uses or preferences in some embodiments the different possible positions may be along a straight line in other embodiments the different possible positions may be along an arc that is the seat may trace a straight line shape or an arc shape when switched between the various positions in other embodiments the seat may trace any shaped line when switched between positions further for whatever path the seat traces any number of possible positions may be used in between the two extreme positions a  and c   in some embodiments the seat may be rotated about an axis perpendicular to the bicycle frame plane this plane contains the frame of the bicycle thus such an axis would be approximately parallel to a wheel axis this is the equivalent of a “pitch” type of rotation thus such rotation of the seat allows the rider to either pitch up or pitch down for example when in back position a  a rider may elect to pitch up so that relative to a level seat the front portion of the seat moves up and the back portion of the seat moves down conversely when in forward position  a rider may elect to pitch down so that the front portion of the seat moves down and the back portion of the seat moves up relative to a level seat depending on the shape of the seat the front portion of the seat may be higher or lower than the back portion of the seat when pitched in either direction  in some embodiments the traced shape of the seat may be translated or moved for example for a given starting position at position a  and given a shape to trace the positions b  and c  are thus defined in space however all three positions or however many positions an embodiment has may be moved together for example a different starting position at position a  may be used suppose position a  is moved up and back by a certain distance this will in turn translate or move the shape that the seat traces up and back by the same distance thus moving position b  and c  up and back by the same distance in this manner different sized riders may adjust the seat so that the various positions result in optimal configurations for instance a short rider may want positions that will be closer to the ground while a tall rider may want positions higher up these riders can adjust the seat accordingly so that all possible positions are relatively lower or higher respectively than they otherwise would be the translation or movement of the traced shape may also be further forward or backward or any combination of forwardbackward and updown  in certain embodiments the seat is configured to be switched between one or more seating configurations via an ottoman bracket andor an lshaped bracket in some embodiments the ottoman bracket andor lshaped bracket can comprise one or more holes that allow for one or more seat configurations in certain embodiments the seat is configured to be manually adjusted and locked into a particular position in other embodiments the seat is configured to be automatically moved and locked into a preferable position via a button or other input that a rider can select  in some embodiments the vertical distance of the seat from the bottom of the wheels can be adjusted from about  inches to about  inches or any other range for example depending on the seat configuration the vertical distance of the seat from the bottom of the wheels can be about  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches or any other height  in certain embodiments the horizontal distance from the front of the seat to the handles of the electric bicycle can be adjusted from about  inches to about  inches or any other range for example depending on the seat configuration the horizontal distance from the front of the seat to the handles of the electric bicycle can be about  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches  inches or any other distance bags configuration  in an embodiment an electric bicycle comprises one or more bags configured to hold cargo or any other items figs ag illustrate an example of an embodiment of an electric bicycle comprising one or more bags  in an embodiment one or more bags  are located in the rear of the electric bicycle in some embodiments the one or more bags  are permanently or semipermanently integrated to the electric bicycle in other embodiments the one or more bags  or parts thereof are selectively removable from the electric bicycle  in some embodiments the one or more bags  cover the rear wheel or portions thereof providing a protective cover for the rear wheel by covering the rear wheel or portions thereof the one or more bags  can reduce exposure of the rider andor rear wheel to dirt or other debris the one or more bags  can also function as a protective layer for the rear wheel against shock or damage  in some embodiments the one or more bags  comprise a hard shell andor soft compartment or pouch the hard shell or structure can be made of any type of hard material such as a hard plastic for example the hard shell can provide a rigid structure to the one or more bags  such that the one or more bags  can maintain a certain form andor shape also the hard shell can prevent the one or more bags  from poking into the rear wheel frame  in some embodiments the one or more bags  comprise a semirigid outer shell connected to a main body of the bag with an elastic material the elastic material can be configured to hold the outer shell tight or close to the body when the bag is not full and to hold the shell tight to cargo placed within the bag when the bag is full or partially full in some embodiments the bags  are configured to be waterproof andor cut resistant in some embodiments the bags  are permanently fixed to the bicycle frame or removably attached to the bicycle frame in some embodiments as further described below the bags  may comprise one or more internal or external pockets for holding various items such as for example batteries a controller andor dirty locks in some embodiments one or more pockets are specially configured to hold a particular item such as a battery controller dirty locks andor the like for example a special pocket for holding a dirty lock may comprise waterproof or other materials andor a seal to reduce a risk of transferring dirt contaminants andor moisture from the lock to other items within the bag  the soft compartment or pouch can be made of any soft material such as any type of fabric soft plastic canvas leather or any other appropriate material or trim the soft compartment or pouch can be flexible in some embodiments to be able to carry a wide variety of items in size and dimension in certain embodiments when empty the soft compartment or pouch collapses to lay flat against the hard shell and closer to the rear wheel this can allow for a more aerodynamic configuration of the electric bicycle in contrast in certain embodiments when one or more items are placed in the soft compartment or pouch the soft compartment or pouch can expand while being supported by the hard shell  in certain embodiments an electric bicycle comprises a platform  the platform  can be configured to be used for resting a riders feet andor for providing support for the soft compartment or pouch dedicated pockets  in some embodiments the one or more bags  comprise one or more compartments or pouches that are dedicated for particular items for example in certain embodiments the one or more bags  can comprise one or more dedicated battery pouches or compartments  for battery mounting and suspension on one or both sides of the electric bicycle in other embodiments the one or more bags  can comprise one or more dedicated compartments or pouches for a bicycle lock andor helmet for example the one or more bags  may be used to hold or store dirty locks  in certain embodiments the one or more bags  comprise a plurality of dedicated battery compartments  in various locations in some embodiments the compartments  are on one or both sides of the bags  in other embodiments the compartments may be instead or in addition to being on the sides on the back end of the bags  that is farthest from the handles on the bike still in other embodiments the compartments  may be on a front side of the bags  that is farthest toward the handles of the bike or the compartments  may be in any combination of front side andor back locations on the bags  the compartments  may further by located in any of these positions on both or either the exterior of the bags  andor the interior of the bags  in some embodiments the bags  may also include covers to protect the bags  from the elements andor hide the bags  from view for security purposes  in certain embodiments the one or more bags  comprise a plurality of dedicated battery compartments  of various shapes and sizes to accommodate batteries of various shapes and sizes in some embodiments the battery compartments  are substantially rectangular in shape and are configured to hold a plurality of batteries shaped approximately like a brick and of various sizes for instance the compartments  may be configured to hold batteries approximately shaped like a brick andor rectangle with width depth and length dimensions respectively of about  inches by about  inches by about  inches other possible width dimensions include about  inches about  inch about  inches about

dedicated battery compartments  are diagonal or substantially vertical in configuration with an opening at the top to allow for easy installation and removal while providing sufficient stability such that the battery does not fall out  in some embodiments an electric bicycle comprises a plurality of battery compartments  on one or multiple sides of the electric bicycle for example in some embodiments one two or three battery compartments  may be located on each side of the electric bicycle in other embodiments more battery compartments  may be located on one side compared to another side in certain embodiments one or more battery compartments  may be located on only one side of the electric bicycle  in some embodiments a dedicated battery compartments  further comprises a connector mechanism to connect the battery to the electric bicycle such that battery can power the electric motor for example a dedicated battery compartments  can comprise a cradle dock cables andor pins for connecting the battery to the electric bicycle a battery compartments  can also comprise any other battery connecting mechanism that is currently wellknown or is to be developed in the future in some embodiments the battery connecting mechanism that connects the one or more batteries to the motor is protectively covered by the one or more bags   in certain embodiments unlike some other electric bicycles that are restricted to a proprietary battery a number of different types of batteries can be installed dedicated battery compartments  of some embodiments are flexible in shape andor size and can accommodate batteries with varying shapes andor sizes in addition in certain embodiments a dedicated battery compartment  can allow for simple installation andor removal of batteries for recharging replacing andor upgrading among other purposes  the bags  andor compartments  in some embodiments are aerodynamically shaped to minimize andor lower drag on the bike when moving and thus increase efficiency of the electrical system in other embodiments the bags  andor compartments  are bulkier and sacrifice aerodynamic efficiency for more storage space vehicle control system  currently different states andor countries have different laws governing the use of electric bicycles for example the definition andor restrictions of electric bicycles and their power can be different in each state andor country laws regarding the maximum speed of electric bicycles can also be different for example the us federal law defines and restricts electric bicycles to bicycles with electric motors of less than  watts and with a top motorpowered speed of less than  miles per hour with a rider that weighs less than  pounds in comparison california restricts the maximum power output of electric bicycles to  watts and florida allows electric bicycles with a maximum power output of up to  watts  needless to say the different laws and regulations of each jurisdiction create a challenge for electric bicycle manufacturers in creating a single product that complies with all such rules one option for manufacturers is to develop a lowpowered electric bicycle that complies with the regulations of all jurisdictions and can be sold everywhere however such electric bicycles are unnecessarily restricted in both power andor speed and consequently may not appeal to consumers thereby hindering sales another option is to develop customized electric bicycle products for each jurisdiction to maximize the power andor speed allowed by the laws of each jurisdiction however this option inherently leads to high costs in design and manufacturing of multiple models  as an alternative to developing a sufficiently lowpowered electric bicycle to comply with all state regulations or developing customized electric bicycles per jurisdiction an embodiment of an electric bicycle as disclosed herein uses software and a computer systems to control the maximum power output andor speed within the regulations of each jurisdiction in other words in some embodiments an electric bicycle with hardware specifications above the regulations of one or more jurisdictions is adaptable to such regulations via software and a computer systems such electric bicycles can maximize the power andor speed limits allowable by the laws of each jurisdiction in this way a manufacturer of an electric bicycle only needs to design build and market one electric bicycle product for a plurality of jurisdictions as long as the software and computer systems can limit the maximum power andor speed output

certain embodiments the user access point system confirms the lower maximum speed andor power value selected at block  motor placement  generally most electric bicycles comprise a hubmotor that is located within the rear wheel frame of the electric bicycle however such designs have many disadvantages for example because hubmotors cannot be configured to be used with gears a specially designed low rpm motor must be used for placement inside the rear wheel frame also the weight of the hubmotor naturally affects the weight of the rear wheel and affects the dynamics of the electric bicycle in addition due to the restrictions in size and placement only motors of a particular size andor configuration may be installed in such electric bicycles further it can be difficult to remove andor install a hubmotor due to its placement inside the rear wheel frame in some cases the whole rear wheel has to be replaced in order to replace a hubmotor  in contrast in an embodiment of an electric bicycle the electric motor is placed outside the rear wheel frame in some embodiments the electric motor is placed substantially beneath the seat frame figs ag illustrate an example of an embodiment of an electric bicycle where the electric motor  is located beneath the seat and is attached directly to the bicycle frame itself in some embodiments the motor  is located substantially above a jackshaft   by locating the motor  outside of the rear wheel frame such embodiments of an electric bicycle are more flexible and adaptable as they can be used with a wider range of motors for example because the motor  is not located within the rear wheel frame the motor  can be configured to be used in conjunction with hinge gears which allows use of a number of conventional motors that are not necessarily specially designed for low rpm also there are less weight restrictions as the weight of the wheel itself is not affected by the motor  in addition motors  with a wider range of sizes andor configurations can be installed further it is easier to remove andor install a motor  drivetrain design  in some embodiments the drivetrain of an electric bicycle is chainfree and comprises belt drives    in some embodiments one or more belt drives    of the electric bicycle or portions thereof are covered for example in some embodiments where one or more bags  are located in the rear of the

that there is complete independence between the electric motor  and pedals  for example in some embodiments there is no or substantially no resistance to the pedals  from the motor  when the motor is powering the electric bicycle in certain embodiments when the electric bicycle is powered by the motor  the motor  moves a first belt drive  which further turns a jackshaft  as the jackshaft  is turned a second belt drive  is moved thereby turning the real wheel   in some embodiments when the pedals  are moved to power the electric bicycle the pedals  move a third belt drive  which further turns a jackshaft  in some embodiments an electric bicycle comprises an idler  contacting the third belt drive  in some embodiments the same jackshaft  is turned by both manual pedaling  and the electric motor  as the jackshaft  is turned the second belt drive  is moved thereby turning the rear wheel   in some embodiments the first second and third belt drives    substantially form a tshape with the jackshaft  located at the intersection in certain embodiments the angle between the first and second belt drives   the first and third belt drives   andor the second and third belt drives

and third belt drives   are located on the other side of the electric bicycle in certain embodiments the first belt drive  is located on one side of the electric bicycle and the second and third belt drives   are located on the other side of the electric bicycle in other embodiments the first second and third belt drives    are all located on the same side of the electric bicycle  in some embodiments the various belt drives are on pulleys attached to the various axles for instance a first belt drive  may be on a pulley connected to the electric motor  and on a pulley connected to the jackshaft  an axle is connected to this pulley on the jackshaft  which connects to other pulleys on the axle among these other pulleys one pulley may be connected to the second belt drive  and another pulley connected to the third belt drive  the jackshaft  and axle may have more or less pulleys in various arrangements and locations depending on the arrangements and locations of the various belt

life cycles issues in manufacturing strategy the product life cycle is mostly considered a marketing and product design issue but there are important implications for manufacturing and manufacturing strategy as well this article gives an overview of the traditional discussion of life cycles and extends that discussion to manufacturing strategy the concept of a product life cycle has been around for almost forever until levitts  article appeared in hbr it seemed to have little use other than as a vague framework for theoretical discussion levitt showed how it should lead to specific policies and actions however it was still about marketing until hayes  wheelwrights article  the most common lifecycle curve as shown above is a very approximate representation the overall timeframe may vary from a few months to decades or even centuries the life cycle of the proverbial buggywip was several centuries that of the hula hoop about a year not only the timeframe but the shape of the curve can be quite different for certain products and markets apple for example has considerably distorted the usual curve apples products are typically introduced with great fanfare and sales immediately skyrocket level off and abruptly decline as the next model is introduced in about a year this is a marvelous approach for companies that can attain the status of a fashion icon however the approach carries a certain risk in the event of a quality defect the firms reputation can be severely damaged for many years microsoft demonstrated this with windows vista development phase marketing and product design have most of the work during development however manufacturing has a valuable longterm role by ensuring that the product is easy to manufacture with high quality introduction phase most products start with pilot production on a small scale manufacturing must plan for this and also plan for the  frequent design changes that often occur in the early phases of a products life quality is critical at this point because defective products can damage the reputation of the product or even the entire firm such a reputation for poor quality may prevent or at least stifle further growth one exception to the above paragraph is illustrated by apples strategy here the manufacturing challenge is to increase production from pilot to a very large volume in a very short time failure to satisfy the immediate demand means lost sales and more importantly lost market share quality becomes even more critical with this kind of marketing strategy growth phase during growth the manufacturing challenge is to increase production to meet increasing demand while maintaining quality and controlling cost ideally capacity would be added in small steps slightly ahead of demand but this is often difficult because of process technology limitations increased variety is usually seen in this phase as well manufacturing must accommodate it without adding too much cost maturity phase by the time the product has matured competitors are often in the market and cost must be reduced to maintain profits without sacrificing market share variety is likely to grow further as marketing develops new variations to extend the product life decline phase as a product declines manufacturing must scale down processes and prune unprofitable variations while maintaining profitability as long as possible stage marketingdesign perspectives manufacturing perspectives development  focus on product features potential markets and marketing strategy ensure that features meet market requirements develop a design that has quality from the very start ensure producibility initial planning for future stage processes and technologies introduction determine pricing market penetration or skimming strategy identify  correct flaws quickly quality from the start is imperative develop a process that is economically feasible at a small scale but can be scaled up as quickly or as slowly as required develop a process that can accommodate design changes growth expand into new markets and uses expand product lines accommodate increased variety employ leading capacity strategy for growth maturity extend product life through promotion design enhancements new uses and options protect profits protect market share aggressively reduce cost invest in more productive equipmentaccommodate increased variety  model changes brought about by lifeextension strategies decline aggressively prune unprofitable products and variety scale down production in orderly manner aggressively prune unprofitable varieties summary the product life cycle is among the many issues addressed in an effective manufacturing strategy it can affect process design plant layout scheduling and other elements it is at the oftencontentious interface between marketing and manufacturing strategies the key manufacturing task will change depending on the life cycle phase apple supplies us with yet another example in their failure to integrate product life cycle thinking into their illfated fremont california factory references levitt theodore exploit the product life cycle harvard business review novdec  hayes robert h
