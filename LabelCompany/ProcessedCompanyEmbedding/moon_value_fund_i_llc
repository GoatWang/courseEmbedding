to collaborate and share deals four groups of wealthy investors in and near dallasfort worth have banded together to help commit more than  million into periosciences llc a dallas supplier of antioxidant toothpastes mouth rinses and antiinflammatory oral gels dallasbased green park  golf ventures llc a business arm of two welltodo area families committed about  also committing were members of dallas’ north texas angel network around  fort worth’s cowtown angels  the newlyformed tyler texas angel network   or so dentists who are both shareholders in periosciences and who help sell its products  and an assortment of other wealthy individuals  investors say the decision to invest in periosciences was easy because of its founder and ceo russell moon who in may  made his fortune by helping sell skinceuticals inc to the french cosmetics giant l’oreal sa on undisclosed terms like periosciences skinceuticals’ antioxidant products fight what are known as “free radicals” unstable molecules in the body which wreak havoc on cells causing tissue damage damaging the mouth and making the body break down as it ages while skinceuticals’ products use antioxidants to help protect and rejuvenate skin in the battle with free radicals periosciences employs them to keep teeth gums the tongue mucous lining of the cheeks and lips looking and feeling their best periosciences sells its wares through dentists and medical spas and its products aren’t cheap the company’s star offering a dental gel called periosciences ao provantage has a suggested retail price of  for a roughly day supply “we’re definitely premium” moon said “we’re not trying to compete with the  colgates” moon invested about  million of his own money getting periosciences started with that cash helping fund research file patent applications and other costs he declined to reveal a revenue number for periosciences but said sales this year should be  percent more than in  with some  dental offices having ordered periosciences products moon will need more sales people along with help in marketing back office support accounting and the like he believes periosciences’ person staff will double or triple in size over the next  months with the cost of that partly funded by the round of financing the business received periosciences should turn cash flow positive next year investor groups work together just a few years ago a north texas entrepreneur like moon would have needed to beat a bunch of bushes to rustle up a  million investment — assuming he could have found it at all venture capital has been scarce in north texas for more than a decade and besides most vcs with some exceptions generally want to put at least  million to  million into a given deal angel investors even in groups would only pony up a few hundred grand but in  dfw not only features more angel groups but those groups are doing something that didn’t happen much in the past talking to each other periosciences’ backers not only helped line up other investors that they knew they shared the background research and other due diligence they’d done on the company and its management team “there’s no reason for angel groups to be exclusive” said darlene ryan executive director of tech fort worth “they want to get deals funded and work with other friendly angel groups” periosciences is the first investment made by the cowtown angels a program of the tech incubator that ryan runs she wasn’t exactly a stranger to the north texas angel network or ntan as she helped that dallas group get off the ground around five years ago ntan in turn helped get the tyler texas angel network into the periosciences mix and the ultimate source for hooking up periosciences with the angel groups was green park  golf ventures “this is a nice little syndication to get russell and his team expansion capital for sales marketing and new product launches” said jim lafferty ntan’s chairman “this is a pretty cool deal we’re proud of it” dallas tx industry news  dallas business journal menu select a city national albany albuquerque atlanta austin baltimore birmingham boston buffalo charlotte chicago cincinnati columbus dallas
