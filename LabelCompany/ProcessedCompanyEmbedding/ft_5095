processing performance whether manually or automatically applied has superior tensile strength adhesion properties and holding force which ensures consistent reliable seals hot melt adhesive will bond faster to a surface which is referred to as quickgrab or quickstick it typically has higher tack will feel stickier to the touch but is also softer it has lower heat resistance shear resistance and sometimes uv resistance than an acrylic adhesive note it is called hot melt because the adhesive is applied hot by the manufacturer and then hardens as it cools you do not need to apply heat to the tape yourself natural rubber properties are similar to that of hot melt rubber but natural rubber often holds where other adhesives wont recycled fibers dust cold heat and heavy loads it provides good overall adhesion and moisture resistance acrylic offer excellent performance especially for applications in temperatures less than °f and greater then °f it provides excellent clarity has high shear strength is usually more permanentdurable even when exposed to moisture and it ages well over extended periods in fluorescent and sunlight since it remains clear for the life of the application and does not yellow over time it is ideal for applications such as sealing white cartons while it has good initial adhesion it does take  hours to cure and to achieve its maximum bond strength has gradual adhesion buildup another difference between hot melt rubber and acrylic adhesive is if you fold tape over making the two adhesive sides touch the acrylic adhesive will remain attached to the carrier eg paper film while a hot melt adhesive will stick to itself and pull off of the carrier it is the best choice for clarity uv resistance and aging characteristics silicone is great for extreme temperature applications since silicone adhesive can work in continuous operating temperatures from °f to °f they also exhibit good chemical resistance retain electrical properties and remove cleanly
