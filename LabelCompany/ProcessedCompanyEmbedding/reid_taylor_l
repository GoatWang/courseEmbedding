say men are getting a bad deal so lets have a mens day but to talk about what harsh sethi the missing ingredient caught between platitudes and mindsets history out of a hat a reid  taylor store in the busy flora fountain area of mumbai’s fort area has a banner on the front which says  per cent off  end of the season sale’ when most brands and retailers have long wound up the end of season sale it is unusual for anyone to hold a discounted sale for two months the store staff nonchalantly says that the merchandise is old and it is part of clearance sale and fresh stock will come within a month the store signifies the the current state of the overyearold scottish brand in the country which once had high brand recall  reid  taylor was launched by s kumar’s nationwide sknl in india in  with a fabric plant at mysuru in karnataka which produces worsted and poly viscose suiting sknl which owned rights to manufacture and market the brand here sells formal and casual wear suits jackets trousers shirts ties and accessories tshirts jeans and weekend wear the apparel was produced by a dedicated facility in bengaluru then sknl claimed reid  taylor was the finest cloth that was available in the country and was the second largest suiting brand in india in the luxury segment  sknl did some high octane advertising and marketing using its brand ambassador bollywood superstar amitabh bachchan and held polo championships to promote the brand the high point came singapore’s wealth fund gic invested in the brand for rs  crore sknl planned an ambitious rs  crore initial public offer ipo for the brand in   which had to be shelved due to poor market conditions its plans to open  flagship stores and  exclusive stores for reid  taylor did not materialise today it owns couple of companyowned stores in cities such as mumbai and franchisee stores elsewhere its advertisements have vanished from everywhere  tv print and outdoor but its products sell on ecommerce stores on discount so how did brand go down reid  taylor’s problems are synonymous with that of its parent’s financial woes riding the boom years sknl did multiple acquisitions and had ambitious plans which led to a debt pile up of rs  crore as of march  causing the company to default on its interest commitments and setting off a host of problems at its peak in fy sknls profits jumped to rs  crore but soon it fell on bad times leading the promoters to pledge their shares to financial institutions a former executive who does not want to be named says the company drew up plans thinking funds will come but that did not happen when you are highly leveraged interest burden will suffocate you sure enough things went from bad to worse as the financial institutions started redeeming the pledged shares according to bse data the promoter group and entities now hold just  stake in the company shelving of the ipo coupled with slowdown in the economy did not help the brand either say experts according to prashant agarwal joint managing director at wazir advisors sknl cut corners everywhere after the financial problems started “they spent less on advertsing and marketing produced less and limited the options which all impacted the brand” says agarwal according to him if a brand is in the market its products should be available in mbos multi brand outlets and ebos exclusive brand outlets in full range and the brand should adveritise for top of mind recall “their products were available more in mbos than ebos if you advertise less your sales will also reduce” he adds nitin kasliwal chairman and managing director of sknl declined to talk about reid  taylor says a former executive with the company it followed a strong brand ambassadorled strategy but did not deliver on the operations front i feel somewhere it lost the customer connect due to lack of innovation in merchandise and marketing a chief executive of a mumbaibased textile company says sknl paid high rentals while opening its stores of brands such as reid  taylor and belmonte in a bid to build valuations which ate into its operating profits but arvind singhal chairman of retail consultancy technopak advisors recalls that reid  taylor was one of the most successful launches in the recent times “the brand came from nowhere and became successful they had good advertising and good product but due to larger issues the brand faced challenges” singhal says read more on reid  taylor  s kumar’s  companies  features previous story next story recommended for you advertisements open a demat account with sharekhan  learn online
