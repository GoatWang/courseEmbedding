allows the company to map various types of conduits and pipelines from  cm  inches to  cm  inches in diameter pipelines or conduits can be of any material metallic or nonmetallic and can be located at any depth since the smart probe does not communicate with the surface this is also an economical solution for mapping under bodies of water or under large pieces of equipment as the smart probe does not require a data tether or any communication with the surface such as a sonde  geospatials smart probe freedom ii em pipeline mapping technologies geospatial’s smart probe freedom ii electromagnetic mapping system provides efficient underground pipeline mapping with centimeter accuracy in xyz providing accurate d positional data along with top of grade and depth of cover data to within  cm  inches there is no need to enter the pipeline and this technology is not affected by soil conditionsthe smart probe freedom ii electromagnetic pipeline mapping technology employs a set of magnetic field sensors to accurately measure the d vector from our sensors to an underground utility and automatically combines this vector with absolute positions obtained via gnss or other survey methods to obtain the d coordinates of the utility the probes novel approach allows it to measure the d vector from any vantage point within range and its builtin acceleration and magnetic sensors allow it to operate in almost any position moreover it offers two distinct operating modes line and sonde extending its capabilities to most surveying situationswith this system geospatial has the ability to map most pipelines up to  feet  meters in depth we are capable of mapping both metallic and nonmetallic pipelines such as hdpe pvc or other composites to map nonmetallic pipelines a detectable rodder must be inserted into the conduit our smart probe freedom ii em mapping system accurately maps underground cables as well as pipelines as small as ” in diameter adaptations of our smart probe freedom ii em pipeline mapping technologies allow geospatial to collect data with our sensors mounted to an all terrain vehicle atv allowing accurate and efficient data collection over a long distance all data from this system seamless downloads via the web into our geounderground data management system or any standard gis system geospatials smart stack combined infrared lidar  microwave technologies geospatial’s smart stack™ combined lidar infrared  microwave technologies was developed to locate underground pipelines and to detect voids and leaks in various underground pipelines including oil gas water and most other materialsour smart stack™ sensors can be deployed on a walking device on a van or groundbased vehicle or atv allterrain vehicle it can also be deployed via a helicopter fixedwing aircraft or uav unmanned aerial vehiclethis unique arrangement or “stack” of sensors and technologies allows geospatial to collect accurate d pipeline locational information over large areas of ground very efficiently and economically geospatial’s smart stack sensors™ have the ability to map pipelines made from any type of material metallic and nonmetallic our sensors can locate pipelines to depths in excess of  meters  feet when combined with geospatial’s “groundtruthing” capabilities that utilize a number of our technologies we can combine highly accurate  cm or  inch xyz coordinates to the data derived from our smart stack™ technologies creating a true d picture of the underground infrastructure covering a very large geographical area in addition to accurate d or d pipeline mapping capabilities geospatial’s smart stack technologies™ provide our clients highly detailed georeferenced leak detection data over the entire area mapped with our smart stack™ system  geospatials smart probe immersion our smart probe immersion underwater mapping system enables geospatial to accurately and efficiently map underwater pipelines and conduits of all sizes and types down to depths as much as  feet  meters from the surface in most cases there is no requirement to enter the pipeline enabling you to keep your system in service throughout the mapping process depending upon site conditions and length of run accessible underwater pipelines can also be effectively mapped utilizing geospatials smart probe freedom ii system all data from each of geospatials underwater mapping technologies seamlessly integrates with the companys geounderground gis portal electromagnetic em locating technologies electromagnetic underground infrastructure location and mapping technologies come in various configurations and capabilities this technology will locate all metallic lines including electrical instrumentation catv telephone steel or ductile iron pipes and nonpressurized and some pressurized systems where a detectable rodder can be placed inside lines may be traced by direct connection to the line or by induction which is placing a transmitter above the expected path of the utility the em equipment consists of a transmitter and receiver the transmitter applies a signal set to a specific frequency to a utility line or any insulated metallic line the transmitted signal is picked up by the receiver which is tuned to the same frequency em equipment has a selection of frequency and power setting options the choice of active frequency and power settings is dependent on site and line conditions in addition to the active frequencies the receivers are equipped to scan for passive hz power and broadspectrum radio frequencies conventional electromagnetic locating technologies conventional electromagnetic locating technologies consist of a handheld receiver combined with an em transmitter with a signal either applied to a line or induced via the soils by walking along the path of the utility following the resultant signal the technician can determine the position of the pipeline or conduit and proceed to follow and record the position of the line in the xy position and roughly the z or depth at the position of each particular reading ground penetrating radar gpr conventional ground penetrating radar will locate metallic and nonmetallic lines provided that the soil conditions are suitable the gpr unit is limited by the soil conditions at the site and the diameter of the utility lines or conduits the gpr equipment sends continuous electromagnetic pulses through the earth or other structures receives the reflected waves back from subsurface structures and displays the results to construct a “picture” of the subsurface structures in some instances gpr can be useful identifying potential targets even if the utility is not visible for example identifying an underlying trench line  vacuum excavation in many cases vacuum excavation may be used if it is necessary to positively identify a buried waterline and confirm its depth this is the only approved mechanical means to safely expose buried utilities geoundergroundgps mappinggis database geospatial
