looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding

securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund industry – assets under management usd billions rd qtr  rd qtr  nd qtr  st qtr  hedge funds b b b b funds

way to invest in the investment universe a different class of investment are managed futures   commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum

foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search heres why the baker bros are gobbling up this emerging cancer company the renowned healthcare investing firm has slowly amassed a huge position in seattle genetics should investors consider riding on their coattails george budwell tmfgbudwell sep   at am the  billion healthcare specialist investing firm comanaged by felix and julian baker known as the baker bros advisors is regarded as one of the best when it comes to picking stocks in this volatile sector  and for good reason the baker bros for instance have had the rare insight to gobble up shares in former smallcap companies like acadia pharmaceuticals bluebird bio and synageva biopharma corp before they ripped higher so when this fund starts to accumulate shares in a company investors may want to take heed  on that note the baker bros have slowly been building a massive position in the antibody drug conjugate or adc specialist seattle genetics nasdaqsgen for a few years now even adding almost  million more shares to their holdings in the second quarter of  according to the quarterly fs filed with the sec in total the firms holdings in the drugmaker are valued at around  billion making it the largest stakeholder in the company  given their significant financial interest in seattle genetics and the fact that felix baker sits on its board of directors  i think its worth the effort to consider if investors should add this stock to their portfolios so lets take a look at what seattle genetics has to offer investors as a midcap biotech stock  seattle genetics is specializing in an emerging field of novel cancer treatmentsbefore immunotherapies stole the headlines and perhaps the show as well adcs were believed to be one of the most promising new classes of cancer treatments coming online after several cases of offsite toxicity cropped up in clinical studies for some experimental adcs though the investing community seemingly forgot about them overnight but the pharma industry has not forgotten not by a long shot by contrast several pharma companies have been working vigorously on improving the technology to make it both safer and more effective across a wide variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies   this work has so far spawned several regulatory approvals for seattle genetics adcetris for various forms of blood cancer and roches kadcyla for herpositive metastatic breast cancer  source seattle genetics commercially speaking these two drugs have also been fairly successful as novel oncology treatments adcetris secondquarter sales for example grew to  million compared to approximately  million for the same period a year ago and not to be outdone kadcyla posted a monstrous  sales growth rate in the first half of  relative to the same period a year ago perhaps the key takeaway from these figures is that the medical community appears to be deeply interested in employing adcs in the fight against cancer  is seattle genetics a buyan easy criticism to lob at seattle genetics is that its a smaller biopharma trying to compete against the big boys like pfizer and roche among others but a deeper look at the company shows that it is a central player in the adc field with major licensing agreements with abbvie glaxosmithkline pfizer roche and many others already in play in short big pharma and biotech appear to be rather optimistic about seattle genetics drug development platform moving forward  so what investors need to understand is that adcs are probably not going to be displaced by the suite of checkpoint inhibitors grabbing the headlines right now evinced in part by big pharmas major investment in this technology and the real focus is to refine the adc platform as a whole turning to the question of whether seattle genetics stock is a buy or not i think the answer is a yes from a fundamental perspective the drugmaker may not look like a compelling value buy  largely because of its huge and growing clinical program that is keeping the companys ledger in the red but its massive core clinical program that sports  clinical candidates being assessed across a whopping  indications has the potential to generate multiple products with each one capable of raking in hundreds of millions in annual revenue and then theres seattle genetics wide diversity of research collaborations that also could lead to a substantial upswing in royalty payments all told seattle genetics wide diversity of clinical activities gives it several shots on goal in terms of turning the company into a profitable operation which is probably one of the main reasons why the baker bros are so keen on this midcap biotech stock    george
