dangerous drugs drug recalls medical device recalls redux fenphen and the products liability act by armand leone jrthe author an attorney and medical doctor is of counsel to chathams blume goldfaden berkowitz donnelly fried  forteplaintiffs have already filed numerous lawsuits alleging injuries caused by the use of the diet drugs dexfenfluramine redux fenfluramine pondimin and phentermine the litigation centers on four classes of defendants  pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians and to lesser extent pharmacies and commercial weight loss centers however plaintiffs seeking recovery in new jersey state courts may have some difficulties in pursuing pharmaceutical product liability claims that are unique accordingly the medical malpractice claims will probably play a larger role in new jersey diet drug litigationthe new jersey product liability act njsa ac et seq specifically provides an evidentiary presumption in the favor of drug manufacturers against failuretowarn claim if the warning or instruction given in connection with a drug or device or food additive has been approved or prescribed by the federal food and drug administration under the federal food drug and cosmetic act  stat   usc sec  et seq  rebuttable presumption shall arise that the warning or instruction is adequatenjsa ac because of the act it will be more difficult to recover under a failuretowarn theory which is the major product liability claim in this litigationthis article examines the potential claims that litigants in new jersey may bring the factual predicates for these claims and the likelihood of prevailing in addition to the plaintiffs claims the pharmaceutical manufacturers can be expected to rely for a defense on both the rebuttable presumption of adequate disclosure and the learned intermediary defense id whether one is counsel for plaintiffs physicians or pharmaceutical defendants one needs to be familiar with the various liabilities that can attach to the physicians who prescribed these drugsbecause of the differences in approved drug information for each one of these diet drugs a thorough understanding of the information submitted to the food and drug administration in the new drug applications as well as the approved drug information for each one is necessary to properly prosecute and defend these claimsthe drug approval processbefore a drug can be released into the marketplace the fda must establish that the drug is safe and effective for the intended uses and approve the drugs labeling and packaging information including the information provided on recommended use warnings and side effects  usc sec  a pharmaceutical manufacturer submits scientific data to the fda as part of its new drug application for the drug after fda reviews the submitted data and any additional data it requires it determines whether or not the new drug is safe and effective for its intended purposes approves the labeling and packaging information and allows the drug to be marketed for the approved indications however fda drug approval is not an investigative process but rather an evaluation that is dependent on the information supplied to the fda by the drug manufacturer see generally ra merrill and pb hutt food and drug law foundation press perhaps the reason why the products liability act creates only a rebuttable presumption that the information disclosed in the physicians desk reference and package insert is adequate is that the nda approval process is entirely dependent upon the information submitted to the fda by the pharmaceutical manufacturer if the manufacturer does not provide all the relevant information to the fda and omits unfavorable data then the fda approval has little if any validity if the fda approved the drug information based upon complete and truthful disclosure of the scientific evidence by the drug manufacturer it seems unlikely that a jury would find against the evidentiary presumption in favor of adequate disclosure thus the proof necessary to overcome the rebuttable presumption of the adequacy of the fdaapproved disclosures may be the equivalent of having to prove intentional misrepresentation and the nondisclosure of adverse information by the manufacturers in the nda approval processthe pdr and malpracticephysicians frequently rely upon the pdr when making decisions concerning the safe administration and dosages of drugs even though drug manufacturers may be in a better position than physicians to determine the appropriate usage and dosage of drugs manufacturers argue that they do not design the package inserts and pdr warnings to establish a standard of medical care morlino v medical ctr of ocean county no a nj decided feb   accordingly the courts measure a doctors duty in a traditional medical malpractice action by an objective standard of care with rare exception proof of this standard requires testimony by a medical expert rosenberg ex rel rosenberg v cahill  nj  the pdr contains detailed information relevant to the proper usage of the drugs by physicians and expert testimony often is needed just to understand it deviation from the fda recommended usage does not generally establish a deviation from the standard of medical care required by a doctor in the absence of expert testimony the decision of whether to prescribe a drug and if so the manner in which it is used is usually a matter of judgment for the physician in addition to considering the individual patient the physician may consider all available information including the package insert the pdr medical journals peer advice and the physicians own experience when supported by expert testimony however the pdr provides strong evidence of the applicable standard of care in malpractice actionsthe pdr has a different role in an action for lack of informed consent the objective reasonable person standard is used to determine whether an undisclosed risk of the treatment was material and whether a reasonable person having been advised of the undisclosed risk would have undergone the treatment in these cases there is a reduced need for expert testimony because the court need only find that the risk of injury was a material one that was recognized in the medical community largey v rothman  nj   adamski v moss  nj super   app div the recognition of a risk in the medical community can be established through the testimony of an expert relying upon the pdr since it is a medical treatise that identifies specific risks associated with the use of diet drugs a court could even take judicial notice of the pdr as it can with other established medical treatises even without judicial notice the reliability of the pdr can be established when a medical expert or even the defendant testifies that physicians generally rely upon it when prescribing medications plaintiffs may also present additional testimony that physicians generally rely upon the pdr and package inserts to learn the risks of the drugs they prescribe accordingly the plaintiffs in lack of informed consent cases will be able to rely almost exclusively on the risks warned of in the pdr in proving liability since the pdr will be found reliable through judicial notice expert testimony or the defendants own admissionsproduct liability claimsproduct liability relies primarily on failuretowarn claims and possibly design defect claims in the context of dietdrug litigation proof of failuretowarn claims will require a demonstration that the manufacturers failed to provide sufficient warning of the potential injuries in view of the known clinical trial data and european product experience in new jersey plaintiffs may even be required to show that the manufacturers failed to advise the fda of adverse effects that were known to them but not disclosed to the fda and the medical community in essence new jersey plaintiffs may have to make a prima facie showing of fraud in the nda approval process in order to overcome the rebuttable presumption of adequate disclosureclaims based on design defect are more difficult to postulate but are not inconceivable there was a considerable amount of available medical research and knowledge on the adverse effects of excess systemic seratonin on heart valves before the approval of dexfenfluramine fenfluramine and phentermine for marketing in fact recognition of the dietdrug injuries was possible in part because of the rare but wellknown cardiac valve abnormalities associated with seratoninsecreting carcinoid tumors of the lung fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are seratoninlike chemicals whose antiobesity action depends on their ability to bind to act like seratonin in the brain a design defect claim might be based on the known danger to heart valves of using a seratoninlike drug since valve injuries were known to be associated with high systemic levels of seratoninmedical malpractice claimsthe two malpractice claims that play a role in this litigation are lack of informed consent and deviation from standard of care both of these liability theories will depend for support upon the fdaapproved usage and warnings in the pdr which unfortunately differ for each drug informed consent claims will be for the undisclosed increased risk of primary pulmonary hypertension pph and the unknown risks associated with the use of the popular combination known as fenphen deviation claims will depend on the following theories inappropriate patient selection prolonged use overdosing negligent monitoring unapproved uses and failure to discontinueprimary pulmonary hypertension pph has a fouryear fatality rate of  percent and was listed in bold in the warning section as a known risk of dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine when used for three months or longer the original fda warnings in april  indicated that use for longer than three months created a relative risk of developing pph that was nine times greater than normal on august   wyethayerst and interneuron pharmaceuticals issued a press release advising doctors that the labeling for dexfenfluramine would be revised because the actual relative risk of developing pph was at least  times normal any physician who failed to advise the patient of this risk should be liable for lack of informed consent if pph subsequently developedit is probable that a jury would agree that a reasonable person in the plaintiffs condition having been informed of the ninefold and later at least a fold increase in pph would have opted not to take the drug for longer than three months on the other hand physicians would not be liable for lack of informed consent to plaintiffs who developed cardiac valve injuries unless the plaintiff was treated with the unapproved combination of fenfluramine and phentermine fenphen liability for lack of informed consent can only attach to known risks that become actual complications and cardiac valve injury was not disclosed as a risk in the pdr of course a product liability claim against the manufacturers for failure to warn physicians the fda and the public of these cardiac valve injury risks does remainunapproved uses of approved drugs the unapproved use of the approved drugs fenfluramine and phentermine in the combination known as fenphen creates an interesting informed consent issue because the risks of these drugs in combination were unknown plaintiffs can claim that physicians probably should have disclosed that the use of the fenphen combination was not a recognized use of the drugs that there were no studies showing that it was a safe combination to use and that the risks of the fenphen therapy were unknown a patient would then have to accept this risk of the unknown and be willing to use the drugthe manufacturer wyeth issued a letter to physicians in january  advising that pondimin fenfluramine had not been tested with other drugs and combining was not recommended the letter specifically advised that combination use is not approved use and that fenfluramine is indicated for shortterm use only on july   the fda issued a public health advisory to doctors requesting reports of fenphen side effects and reminding physicians that the safety and efficacy of the fenphen combination had not been proved and serious concerns about its use had been raised considering the specificity with which the manufacturers and the fda advised physicians against using the fenphen combination the duty to disclose the risk of using this unapproved combination may be further increasedthe use of an unapproved combination of approved drugs on patients seems similar to the use of an experimental drug under an investigational new drug application inda the consent process for use of an experimental drug as part of an inda is extremely detailed and heavily regulated see eg wk simpson investigational drugs likely have immunity product liability law and strategy sept  it would appear that the same consent requirements should have existed when physicians prescribed the unapproved combination of fenphen for their patients arguably any complicating injury that occurred from the use of fenphen could be compensable under a lack of informed consent theoryinappropriate patient selection physicians may face liability for use of these diet drugs in patients who were treated only for cosmetic weight reduction rather than for medically significant obesity dexfenfluramine was approved by the fda for individuals with a threshold body mass index bmi equal to or greater than kgm or for individuals with bmis greater than kgm who had other risk factors such as hypertension diabetes and hyperlipidemia it was also contraindicated for use in patients with organic causes of obesity and with glaucoma physicians who prescribed dexfenfluramine for patients with lower bmis may be liable for all causally related adverse effects since the exposure to the drugs was medically unnecessary the pdr even included a bmi heightweight reference chart to aid physicians in selecting appropriate patients on which to use the drugfda approval requires that a drug be safe and effective including the demonstration of an acceptable riskbenefit analysis between the known complications of the disease or condition the drug is intended to treat and the side effects of the drug  usc sec d when dexfenfluramine was approved for use above specific threshold bmis the fda determined that the benefits of weight reduction in this group of obese patients outweighed the risks of the medication that had been reported to the fda however the fda felt that the risks of using dexfenfluramine in patients with lower bmis outweighed any potential benefits from weight reductionfenfluramine and phentermine did not have as clearly defined threshold bmis for which the drugs had been approved for use in weight loss the pdr indicated that these drugs should be used for the management of exogenous obesity but did not quantify what level of obesity is appropriate for these anorexigens it may be reasonable to assume that the same bmi thresholds that applied to dexfenfluramine should have applied to these drugs as wellprolonged usephysicians who prescribed diet drugs for longer than the recommended treatment periods may face liability because of the prolonged exposure to the drugs fenfluramine and phentermine were approved for management of exogenous obesity as a shortterm a few weeks adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restrictions the pdr stated that tolerance to the anorexic effect usually develops in a few weeks for both fenfluramine and phentermine when this occurred the drug was to be discontinued rather than increased in dosage in an attempt to regain the anorexic effect once the anorexic effect was removed no benefits from the use of these drugs could have remained and the risks of continuance would have been unacceptable prolonged usage may create liability for all injuries even in patients meeting the appropriate bmi thresholdsthere was conflicting information in the pdr concerning the appropriate length of treatment with dexfenfluramine under the indications  usage and the dosage  administration sections the pdr stated that the safety and effectiveness of redux beyond  year have not been determined at this time however under the warnings section the pdr stated that in a twoyear international casecontrol study the use of anorexigens for longer than three months was associated with a ninefold increase in the risk of developing primary pulmonary hypertension liability for prolonged use would appear to attach to physicians who prescribed dexfenfluramine for longer than a year but it is unclear whether physicians who prescribed it for more than three months also would be liableoverdosingthe fda approval specified maximum daily doses for these drugs that arguably should not have been exceeded by physicians when prescribing them the maximum daily doses were fenfluramine mg per day in three divided doses phentermine  mgs per day taken once daily and dexfenfluramine  mg per day in two divided doses since larger doses would increase the cumulative exposure to these drugs physicians who prescribed them above the recommended dosage may be liable to patients who sustained heart valve injuries as well as pph arguably the physician did not follow safe medical practice that would have limited the patients cumulative exposure to the drug and have prevented these injuriesphysicians who prescribed these drugs had a responsibility both to monitor patients for signs of cardiopulmonary injury and to use these drugs only as an adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction plaintiffs will argue that this created a duty in the prescribing physicians to provide nutritional counseling and to monitor a dietary program for the patient the significance of recognizing obesity as a chronic problem means that successful treatment requires a coordinated program of medication diet and exercise negligent monitoring could arise in cases where a plaintiff developed signs and symptoms of cardiopulmonary problems and was not removed from the drug it could also arise in cases where these drugs were used as the sole means to achieve weight reduction in such cases physicians may be liable for all causally related injuriesthe fenphen combinationbefore the introduction of dexfenfluramine many doctors prescribed the fenphen drug combination the fenphen combination was an unapproved use of approved drugs for which no safety and efficacy data existed the unapproved use of approved drugs usually does not constitute a deviation from accepted standards of medical care the forward to the  pdr stated the fda has always recognized that the law does not however limit the manner in which a physician may use an approved drug once a product has been approved for marketing a physician may choose to prescribe it for uses or in treatment regimens or patient populations that are not included in approved labeling the fda also observes that accepted medical practice often included drug use that is not reflected in approved drug labelingbut recall that wyeth issued a warning in january  and the fda issued a public health advisory in july  so the prior discretion afforded to physicians who used approved drugs in unapproved ways may not provide immunity from malpractice liability in this situation this may be even more of an issue for physicians who used this combination after the wyeth warningin addition in august  fenphen was reported in the new england journal of medicine to cause heart value injuries that prompted its voluntary removal from the market on september   hm connelly et al valvular heart disease associated with fenfluraminephentermine n eng j med   any physician who continued to prescribe or failed to advise patients to discontinue use of these drugs within a reasonable period of time from the recall announcement could be liable for all injuries liability most clearly attaches in situations where the physicians actually initiated use of these drugs after the recall date liability is most doubtful in those situations where patients only took the drug for a short period of time subsequent to the recall and in any event for no longer than the recommended treatment periodsthe learned intermediary defensepharmaceutical manufacturers have a defense to failure to warn claims when physicians use their drugs contrary to the approved package insert and pdr information facts that support plaintiff malpractice claims also support the learned intermediary defense even if the drug manufacturers dont directly assert crossclaims proofs of this defense indirectly support plaintiffsa georgetown university study reported on april   sheds some interesting light both on the issue of physician liability and the learned intermediary defense leaving aside potential bias caused by its sponsor wyethayerst the georgetown study reported that there was no increase in heart damage from shortterm use of the diet pill redux the participants took the drug for  days and no valvulopathies were detected an fda physician nevertheless commented we believe that there is a significant rate of valvular abnormalities the data suggest it is related to the duration of exposure the fda estimates that onethird of people taking the diet pills suffered significant heart damage as a resultwhile the georgetown study has yet to be confirmed by others it supports the proposition that the fda approved usage of redux by physicians both in terms of length of use and maximum dosage is not associated with adverse cardiac and pulmonary effects this study may be used to deflect liability from the manufacturers to the prescribing physicians who prescribed redux inappropriately for prolonged periods
