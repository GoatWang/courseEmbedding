communities fund – the empire group llc empire residential communities fund the empire team recognizing the significant buying opportunity created by the foreclosure crisis was one of the first largescale buyers of distressed homes in phoenix between mid and early  the empire residential opportunity funds raised over  mm and purchased over  singlefamily foreclosures and short sales these homes were transformed into singlefamily rentals thus generating rental income that not only covered holding costs such as property taxes insurance maintenance etc but also generated net income that could be distributed to the funds’ investors today many of these assets have doubled in value creating the backdrop for strong investment returns investopedia new york ny both real estate funds and real estate investment trusts reits are used when diversifying a longterm investment portfolio a real estate fund is a type of mutual fund that primarily focuses on investing in securities offered by public real estate companies the majority of real estate funds are invested in commercial and corporate properties although they also may include investments in raw land apartments complexes and agricultural space this type of fund can invest in properties directly or indirectly through reits a reit is a corporation trust or association that owns or finances incomeproducing real estate their mode of operation is similar to that of a mutual fund where investors combine their capital to buy a share of commercial real estate and then earn income from their shares reits’ taxable income is paid out as dividends to their shareholders who then pay income tax on the dividends there are three main types or reits equity reits mortgage reits and hybrid reits equity reits own operate and trade hard real estate assets mortgage reits trade commercial and residential mortgages hybrid reits are a combination of equity and mortgage reits the majority of revenue associated with equity reits come from real estate property rent while the revenue associated with mortgage reits is generated from interest through mortgage loans investments in both reits and real estate funds have their benefits and drawbacks the benefits of investing in reits include their lower investment entry costs insofar that investors can invest as little as  or the price of one share secondly reits offer a highly liquid method of investing in real estate thirdly reits are highly flexible allowing investors to invest in a range of real estate from commercial properties to shopping malls real estate funds that invest in mortgage reits provide higher yields than real estate funds that invest in equity reits conversely as equity reits trade on assets and not on mortgage loans capital gains are instead far more attainable for equity reits mortgage reits don’t offer as much capital gains as equity reits because an earned capital profit cannot be attained on a loan mortgage reits’ potential for capital gains are correlated against interest rates as the higher the interest rate the greater the gain conversely the opposite also applies if mortgage rates fall the reit receives diminished interest payments and thus suffers a loss of expected income as reits generally deliver more of an income neither provides longterm capital appreciation on the other hand real estate funds that are not invested in reits can offer capital appreciation and fund value appreciation real estate fund investments allow investors to reap the same benefits they would if they were investing in a mutual fund as they receive the same professional and portfolio management support real estate fund investments with direct real estate investments invest in assets while real estate funds that invest indirectly invest in reits an investor is however able to choose whether to invest in a real estate fund that may or may not invest in reits or invest in reits directly

companies generally involve a much greater degree of risk compared to traditional investments such as stocks bonds or mutual funds interests in limited liability companies llc are often sold as
