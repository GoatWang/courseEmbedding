can legally take advantage of startup investing opportunities under minimal limitations because of accredited investors’ presumed wealth they are deemed more able to bear the high financial risk of investments in private companies as a result of recent changes to securities laws companies may now decide whether to raise from everyone or just from accredited investors under recent developments such as title iii and title iv of the jobs act nonaccredited investors are allowed to legally invest alongside accredited investors under certain guidelines title iii and title iv of the jobs act permit what is known as “equity crowdfunding” whereby companies can openly advertise their offerings and accept investments from nonaccredited investors – the  of americans who do not meet the
