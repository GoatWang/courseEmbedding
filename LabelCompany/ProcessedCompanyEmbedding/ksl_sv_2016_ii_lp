americatalyst fast forward  americatalyst   americatalyst fast forward annual events   americatalyst fast forward   americatalyst fast forward event details details there’s no algorithm for this   between halloween competing events quarterly reporting quiet periods road shows a general malaise in the mortgage industry and a public exhausted by election season participation in this year’s event will be much more intimate than in previous years all of which makes the efforts of every one of you to be here that much more special at the same time it provides an opportunity to get to know those who are here that much better while our numbers are down the caliber of this year’s content and speakers is exceptional i hope that you will learn some things that you didn’t already know get inspired by new ideas and perhaps change the way that you think about the industry in a way that contributes to your greater success   this is the th year of the original eurocatalyst and today’s americatalyst event our theme this year is fast forward what happens next one of the most difficult things about creating the program for this event each year is the ubiquitous nature of the housing ecosystem it is literally affected by everything and everything is affected by it by looking at it in the context of globalization which constantly changes everything faster than anyone can keep up with each year i begin writing the program from a blank slate where we are today is much different than where we were yesterday or last year excluding gse reform but hopefully you get my point in the course of putting together this year’s topics and sessions i spent months researching “the future” the future of central banking the future of banking the future of government the future of regulation the future of capitalism and economic ideologies the future of employment the future of technology future demographics and the future of climate change among other issues i hate to spoil the plot but the future is pretty daunting to say the least at least two sessions this year have the word “crisis” in their subtitles and perhaps my snarkiest title ever  which i was dared to do  says it all “one trick pony a bucking fed throws off the housing market”  for me personally it is particularly sad to feature the session “pandora’s box brexit the future of europe and the world economy” of my  years in this industry  of them were spent living and working across all eu and noneu countries it was there that i was able to implement my greatest career ideas and achievements and it was truly the experience of a lifetime the session is also quite poignant and hearkens to the prescience of the very first eurocatalyst event in madrid in  my theme that year– much to the dismay of the european commission and european mortgage federation–was “will european markets survive globalization” as this year’s session will discuss we now know the answer to that question the unraveling is just a matter of time and will have a phenomenal impact on the us and the rest of the world as most of you know the factor that differentiates this event from all others is the context in which we look at the most important issues facing our industry and where it is headed next up to this year that context has been globalization while there are very intense academic political and social debates about what globalization is when it began and the ideology behind it for the purposes of this event i am not referring to globalization as one dimensional change but a set of changes or forces driven primarily by technology and electronic communication these forces are social cultural and political – and not just economic they widen deepen and intensify the acceleration of global interconnectedness in all aspects of our lives and have driven us into a universally shared economic and political arena it is a convergence hence our theme in  convergence and state of interconnectedness that i refer to as “the entanglement” which was the theme of this event in  while today’s interdependent world demands cooperation compromise and collaboration in order to survive the future the rise of political extremists and movements around the world show anything but  the forces of globalization have altered the structure of states the nature of economies our basic institutions our ideals the way that we live and the way that we finance how we live it encompasses such fundamental and radical changes to our existence that it shifts our knowledge of the world to what we don’t know rather than what we do know in short globalization renders the words “unprecedented” and “unintended consequences” redundant this year i see something new replacing globalization which kevin kelly the founder of wired magazine refers to as “the technium” the technium is the convergence of technology culture and economics at the center of every significant change in our lives now is some kind of new technology as the accelerant of humanity technology dictates that we all will live in a permanent state of beta testing from here on out on the other hand looking back at history we see that every idea and every ideology put into action is one grand social experiment in which we don’t really know the outcome think about that as you listen to the dialogue of this year’s event the future is never predetermined

putting the upside down the emergence of equity sharing  forms of equity sharing known as shared appreciation mortgages or fractional equity ownership whereby investors purchase fractional interest in homes based on house price appreciation in the future are nothing new affordable housing agencies often provide incomeeligible families down payment assistance with structured sharedappreciation mortgages as secondlien loans that mature when the home is sold or the first mortgage refinanced immediately after the debacle of  new firms were established to provide a winwin for homeowners to leverage their equity and provide a handsome return to investors seeking to invest in the housing market with minimal downside riskem today equity sharing is making a comeback with a variety of differentiated strategies to establish institutionalized platforms processes and products buoyed by the federal reserve’s september th report stating that american homeowners have  trillion in equity in their homes amounting to double the equity as of  a more creative solution to overcome restrictive lending standards strong support from private equity firms investing in new startups and investors seeking greater yields or any yields for that matter equity sharing  has arrived this session features two of the leading players in this rapidly growing sector the very visible point digital finance backed by silicon valley titans including andreesen horowitz greylock partners ribbit capital as well as brad greiwe the cofounder of invitation homes laurence tosi the cfo of airbnb and vikram pandit formerly of citigroup among others and the seasoned stealth player revex the brainchild of weiss analytics founder allan weiss both models have enormous positive implications for institutional investors lenders homeowners potential homeowners and singlefamily rental investors this year’s debate is focused on the viability of the product and sector delves into the details of all players in the sector and how each firm is differentiated and enables participants to provide robust feedback on how they might tailor the model and its prospects and implications for the future host patrick mcenerney host amy brandt speakers eoin matthews sean marsh allan weiss pm  pm   the long and short of it closing comments host toni moss am  pm   breaking bad scoring the housing finance market the us homeownership rate has dropped from a high of  in  to its current rate of the lowest rate since  while banks have almost doubled their core capital since  the mortgage system outside of the banks is largely nationalized insufficiently capitalized and barely profitable worth slightly more than the stock market the  trillion us housing stock is perhaps the largest asset class in the world in combination with the  trillion of debt in the us housing finance system this makes the american housing market one of the largest concentrations of financial risk anywhere it remains inextricably linked to the global financial system with  trillion of mortgage debt owned abroad despite this increasing global systemic risk in the ten years since the most severe recession since the great depression the us housing finance market continues unreformed fundamentally flawed and ultimately unsustainable in its current condition this session continues our year narrative about the impact of globalization on the housing ecosystem by picking up from where we left off with last year’s theme “rubicon no turning back” rubicon stressed the unprecedented nature of the world today and emphasized the need to focus on the future as opposed to expectations of or comparisons to a return to the past this collaborative and interactive opening session establishes the foundation for this year’s event by bringing together six of the best minds in housing to create a comprehensive score strengths challenges options responses and effectiveness analysis and strategy assessment of the entire us housing finance system our focus is not only on what should change but how it can transform into a more vibrant equitable and sustainable system moving forward into the future host rick sharga host toni moss speakers teresa bazemore sean dobson mark fleming logan mohtashami ted tozer pm  pm   landslide the silent housing liquidity crisis since  policy response to the “financial crisis” has resulted in a paradox unprecedented monetary intervention has created a massive overhang of liquidity which has recently been linked with severe market illiquidity with interest rates at or below zero in most advanced economies the monetary base in the us has quadrupled these actions have reduced the volatility of bond markets and have caused asset prices including equities real estate and fixedincome private and publicsector bonds to soar yet sudden shocks and extreme volatility are occurring more frequently throughout the global financial system fueling fears that even very deep and liquid markets such as us stocks and government bonds are not liquid enough today the federal reserve’s creation of macro liquidity has resulted in more crowded trades and greater investment in illiquid fixedincome bond funds – most of which allow investors to exit overnight at the same time tighter regulation has led to high capital costs which in turn has reduced profit incentives and virtually eliminated market makers for fixedincome products as a result when market shocks occur the repricing of fixedincome products is abrupt and dramatic and investors caught in crowded trades need to exit swiftly because many investments are in illiquid funds without traditional market makers sellers are forced into fire sales the paradox of macro liquidity and market illiquidity has the similar effect of a flood during an extended period of drought macro liquidity is the equivalent of a flash flood fueling booms and bubbles in its wake market illiquidity is the drought what happens when droughtstricken areas experience excessive amounts of rain landslides when the ground literally accelerates downhill the effect is more damaging than the trigger any questions this session looks at the pervasive lack of liquidity throughout the housing finance ecosystem from whole loans to mortgagebacked and government securities and msrs the implications of the liquidity crisis for the near future and what can or should be done to prevent disaster host tim skeet host christopher whalen speakers ron dvari adam krahn jeff tennyson ted tozer am  am   the technium the technological forces shaping our future for the past  years this conference has been discussing the evolution of the housing market in a hyperglobalized world in our context globalization is not a single economic phenomenon but a set of changes that are social cultural political economic and technological all of which impact the entire housing ecosystem and not just the finance of it those forces in turn have created a world with greater complexities and unpredictability and a world beyond our control “the technium” is a term coined by kevin kelly one of the foremost members of the influential tribe of silicon valley trailblazers and technology futurists known as “the digerati” similar to our view of globalization kelly defines “the technium” as “the convergence of economics culture and technology” and focuses on technology as both the driver of new problems as well as new solutions where globalization is a “winner take all” world the technium is an organism of our own making that increases the number of races in which you can win and new ways in which to win those races in part one of this twopart session toni moss discusses how big data machine learning and increased computing power will soon make artificial intelligence ai ubiquitous and the profound consequences of it in discussing the latest advances in technology in the world today toni aggregates the commentary and ideas of the leading technology futurists to explain how those technologies are being used what business models are using them and in fact what those businesses actually are how they are dramatically altering the entire housing ecosystem and the new challenges and opportunities presented by them this session continues our year narrative about the impact of globalization on the housing ecosystem by picking up from where we left off with last year’s theme “rubicon no turning back” rubicon stressed the unprecedented nature of the world today and emphasized the need to focus on the future as opposed to expectations of or comparisons to a return to the past this collaborative and interactive opening session establishes the foundation for this year’s event by bringing together six of the best minds in housing to create a comprehensive score strengths challenges options responses and effectiveness analysis and strategy assessment of the entire us housing finance system our focus is not only on what should change but how it can transform into a more vibrant equitable and sustainable system moving forward into the future host toni moss am  am   the technium   our product is our process today’s astounding technological advances include big data artificial intelligence robotics d printing digital currency and blockchain among many others these advances occur so rapidly that our ability to invent new things outpaces our human ability to control them despite the tools that currently exist for the most part the technological advances in the mortgage and real estate industry are more “improvement” than true innovation part of this is due to the fact that regulators’ ability to control our new things outpaces our ability to invent them yes you read that right the other part is due to the legacy systems on which we have built an endless series of layers rather than make the necessary investment to rebuild outdated systems as such new market entrants enjoy significant advantages over established institutions one thing is clear the greatest change in the world is not just the pace of change but the prevalence of it from here on out we live in a “beta” state of constant adaptation which requires the equally persistent need to create and learn upgraded versions of everything unrelenting change means that our processes to accommodate change have not only become more important than our products our process is our product in the conclusion of this twopart session we feature leading industry players and technology providers to discuss how new technology will dramatically alter the housing finance and real estate industry and which sectors should or are vulnerable to change we will also discuss how we can leverage new technology to improve existing products processes and practices as well as feature firms with new business models who are leading the real estate and housing finance industry into the future host amy brandt host kyle lundstedt speakers gary beasley dennis cisterna larry huff kristin messerli rebecca steele marianne sullivan am  am  networking and refreshment break am  am  networking and refreshment break pm  pm  lunch sponsored by kroll bond rating agency located in the hill country dining room pm  pm  networking and refreshment break pm  pm   how then shall we live enabling affordable housing affordable housing is not just a lowincome problem anymore the “american dream of homeownership” is being replaced by the american dream to find an affordable home to live in whether owned or rented not only is there a lack of affordable homes to purchase there is also an extreme lack of affordable homes to rent homebuilders are no longer building any material new supply of entrylevel “workforce” housing creating a significant supplydemand imbalance for affordable singlefamily homes with firsttime buyers in their  study “projecting trends in severely costburdened renters” an analysis by enterprise community partners and the harvard joint center for housing studies found that the number of households spending  percent or more of their income on rent is expected to rise at least  percent from  million to  million by  at the same time that rents are rising homeownership rates are declining incomes are stagnating and job layoffs are increasing all of which portray a bleak picture of the increasing severity of renter burdens for the coming decade why should you care about affordable housing despite the variation in types of housing the housing market itself is an ecosystem like any ecosystem every part of it is interdependent and a dramatic imbalance in one part eventually if not immediately affects the entire system in addition to dystopian social outcomes housing becomes more expensive when demand outstrips supply add to that a federal reserve policy that drives a housing bubble and we have another serious crisis at a time when the fed has run out of tools to manage it this session delves into how the current crisis negatively impacts the entire housing ecosystem and what’s at stake and introduces some innovative marketrate development programs designed to mitigate the crisis and rebalance the system host genger charles host tim skeet speakers sarah edelman andrew jakabovics rebecca steele ed pinto tuesday november   pm  pm  networking and refreshment break am  pm  registration desk open located in the wildflower atrium pm  pm   deja vu house and rent price projections as discussed in our previous session “one trick pony” the “blowback” from the federal reserve’s protracted period of interest rate suppression has resulted in massive bubbles in real estate and house prices and in turn has priced many americans out of the housing market entirely we’ve been here before in  american house prices rose unabated for the previous ten years reaching an alltime high that year while homes have recovered nearly all losses from the  crash when adjusted for inflation they are currently  below the  peak some see this as an indication of further room for house price appreciation on the other hand as house and rent prices rise incomes remain flat and credit remains tight something has to give one of the more encouraging differences between the crisis and today is greater access to historical data the ability to utilize that data to better anticipate the direction of house and rent prices the most granular accuracy on current and some would say projected pricing and the creation of “early warning systems” to enable lenders and regulators to better prepare for a steep decline however key economic data used for making critical national economic decisions is flawed in that current measures of inflation do not adequately factor in house price inflation this is not just a national problem it is a global one this past july editors at the economist recently described rising us house prices as “a dangerous menace to the world economy” this informationheavy session provides facts and figures with diverse conclusions on house and rent price projections and their impact along the way we will show the cities with the greatest riskreward profiles for residential investment and rent price appreciation inevitably the data will turn into a hot debate about what the data means for the future host rick sharga host kyle lundstedt speakers douglas bendt mark fleming logan mohtashami allan weiss am  am  opening comments host toni moss am  am   pandoras box brexit the european union and the future of the world economy it’s no accident that we would use a greek myth to refer to the inordinate “uncertainties” that have been unleashed by the june rd decision for the uk to exit the european union while most of us know the basic concepts of “pandora’s box” some may have forgotten the important details “brexit” may seem like a small or remote threat to the us housing and real estate market it does have very farreaching consequences for example in  the uk was the largest single source of foreign direct investment in the us accounting for  billion or  of all foreign investments last year in addition uk foreign investment supports nearly one million jobs across the us with almost one in four of those in the manufacturing sector even more important britain is the primary channel through which the us exerts its economic and political agenda in europe including trade global tax reform financial regulation diplomacy and other crucial issues and we haven’t even begun to describe the impact on europe and the world economy in this description if you think that it does not impact the us housing market you won’t want to miss this session regarding the important detail of pandora’s box once she closed the box she did leave “hope” inside host toni moss host christopher whalen speakers alan boyce tim skeet tony ward pm  pm  private sponsor dinners in downtown austin am  am  a onetrick pony a bucking fed throws off the housing market while there is much more at stake than just the housing finance in this segment we focus on the unintended consequences of federal reserve policy on the housing market and the chain reaction impacting not only housing but every other asset class for at least the next two generations the session features danielle dimartino booth who is the author of the soontobereleased book fed up an insider’s take on the willful ignorance and elitism at the federal reserve host danielle dimartino booth am  pm  b the way forward david stockman on coming back from the brink in his  book the great deformation the corruption of capitalism in america david stockman former congressman director of the office of management and budget and the “father of reaganomics” persuasively argued how the american state – and federal reserve in particular – has fallen prey to the politics of crony capitalism and the ideologies of fiscal stimulus monetary central planning and financial bailouts the result has been unrelenting political dysfunction fiscal collapse and “casino capitalism” which swindles the masses and enriches the few in his new book trumped a nation on the brink of ruin … and how to bring it back stockman discusses how the rigged american system has led to the rise of donald trump as well as bernie sanders despite the book’s title stockman is not an advocate of trump’s candidacy or message but instead focuses on the extent to which trump is the messenger and rallying force behind the political insurrection of main street this segment is focused on stockman’s ideas on a way forward to economic recovery and prosperity at home and a more safe and stable world abroad host david stockman pm  pm  c synthesizing perspectives an open discussion with qa speakers david stockman am  am   the future of real estate the transition of traditional real estate transactions onto the web is nothing new but enhancing the online real estate process with artificial intelligence and virtual reality will change everything currently most online firms are focused on saving their customers time meanwhile market leaders are already developing more fluid technological structures that will enable customers to experience properties through virtual reality and transact in real time accelerating purchase and sales decisions to a matter of minutes in his presentation tenx ceo tim morse provides a clear view of the future of real estate and how advances in the online search selection acquisition and disposition of real estate will aggregate a global base of buyers and sellers and drive the entire housing ecosystem into the stream of now host tim morse  the financialization of politics the fed the housing market and the future of america  featuring danielle di martino booth and david stockman over the past seven years central bankers have gone to unprecedented lengths to find new ways to create monetary stimulus within current central banking frameworks during this time official interest rates in the us uk and the euro area have been reduced to zero taking it a step further each of these countries has augmented monetary policy with massive quantitative easing programs the purchase of massive volumes of longterm government securities to reduce their yields even further these institutions have initiated credit easing and liquidity injections in the banking system by purchasing private assets in order to reduce the costs of privatesector borrowing further still they have introduced forward guidance on monetary policy to keep these low interest rates down for a protracted—and undetermined—period of time other countries have gone to even greater extremes such that today almost a quarter of the global bond market now has negative interest rates while these endeavors may have prevented inflation thus far fund managers argue that these central bank efforts have distorted the price discovery functionality of global markets to such extremes that they have “broken the market” entirely bankers and businesses have gone on an investment strike and use cheap central bank money to inflate the prices of their own assets the result is a massive bubble in house prices real estate and equities as well as the devastation of bond yields and the rising number of investors and retirees who are forced into ultralong government debt which severely restricts their liquidity if belowtrend growth continues and tail risks—economic financial political or geographical—occur central banks are out of options having reached the limits of existing frameworks they must now contemplate whether or not to redesign the engine midflight to keep the plane from stalling host sean dobson host toni moss pm  pm   breaking through scoring singlefamily rental as noted earlier in this program us homeownership has dropped to the lowest percentage in over  years from  to  the six million homes affected by the mortgage crisis comprise the majority of the new rental housing stock contrary to initial industrywide doubts the singlefamily rental sector has continued to grow from strength to strength since its inception in  while there are reasonable concerns surrounding the sector—such as the ability to acquire homes in scale and the difficulties of profitably renovating releasing and managing properties en masse—its maturation has been bolstered by factors such as tight lending for aspiring homeowners rising home prices making home ownership out of reach for middle class families and a generational shift favoring the access to singlefamily homes over their ownership today revenue and margins for owneroperators are on the rise the market demand for rentals continues to soar with a  occupancy rate for stabilized portfolios rental rate growth for both renewals and new rentals markedly lower turnover than the multifamily sector continued house price appreciation in key sfr markets and demonstrable improvement in operating metrics differentiate the sector as a strong growthoriented investment alternative despite these remarkable factors access to growth capital remains a key challenge while upward trending stock prices indicate the success of publicly traded reits the stock market has yet to award full credence to the underlying value of the real estate or sustainability in sfr cash flows as shown in the discount in trading levels of all its publicly traded stocks while this highlights a longstanding concern recent developments are an encouraging sign for the future the successful overnight execution of a nearly  billion secondary offering of amh american homes  rent stock by the alaska permanent fund corporation last month was remarkable for its sheer size and speed of execution and an important indication of the sectors growing acceptance by institutional investors with private equity—both institutional and retail—continuing to rapidly enter the space sfr may well be breaking through in its liquidity and varying price points this session picks up from the keynote singlefamily rental session at rubicon americatalyst  “renting the future” which featured

research a primer changing the industry mindset history influences and inspiration   it’s hardly commonplace for an event in the housing and mortgage industry to be built upon an academic or intellectual foundation then again this is part and parcel of what differentiates americatalyst and its predecessors eurocatalyst and europeservicing from the other events out there below americatalyst founder and ceo toni moss explains the intellectual inspirations behind the event and where some of its unique qualities came from along the way she provides key insights into the historical development of the industry and details how these insights allowed her to anticipate the market failures responsible for the unprecedented circumstances shaping our present and future   the reith lectures on “runaway world” in  professor anthony giddens director of the london school of economics and largely considered the world’s most prolific sociologist presented a stunning series of lectures which rocked the academic world how a newly defined force called globalization was rapidly reshaping our lives the fivepart presentation series titled “runaway world” was featured in  the reith lectures on bbc radio  to illustrate the widespread impact of globalization each of these lectures was delivered from a different city across the globe including  globalisation london  risk hong kong  tradition delhi  family washington dc and ended with democracy london these broadcasts were just the beginning of the international conversation on the interconnected forces swiftly transforming our cultural environment   and its influence  i got hooked on the phenomenon of globalization after reading kenichi ohmae’s book the borderless world in a political science class during college since then it has become one of my life pursuits to understand its impact on the housing ecosystem by  “globalization” was a pervasive “buzzword” yet no one could fully define what it was what differentiated giddens’ approach was the way in which he defined it as a synchronous set of forces social cultural political and economic as opposed to one dimensional change economics or internationalization in his series giddens describes how these forces change every aspect of our lives from the micro level our families ourselves our identity to the macro level multinational corporations nationstates and the economy in this way globalization has created a world so complex that it is beyond our control and understanding based on my previous career in housing finance and my work in  by that time european markets giddens’ lectures led me to recognize that housingand the finance of ithas the same ubiquitous microtomacro weight on a singular and social level notwithstanding the universal need for shelter for most aspiring homeowners a mortgage is the largest amount of money they will ever borrow for the longest period of time not only is it the axis of their overall financial portfolio they will spend the majority of their working lives paying it off at a societal level mortgages have long been the anchor product for all financial institutions throughout the world at national economic levels outstanding mortgage debt typically exceeds at least  of the gdp of every western country in the world and at the global macroeconomic level mortgages and real estate were by  the single largest asset class in global capital markets but changes were occurring on all these levels far earlier than this time by the mids securitization had become a global as opposed to purely us endeavor and countless financial institutions began commodifying and leveraging their mortgage assets in order to access global capital markets the more these products were embraced by the global investor community the more complex and obtuse the issuance structures became  as mortgagerelated investments and house prices around the world significantly increased it appeared  to me that mortgage markets were becoming in essence the epicenter of the global economic faultline  as the forces of globalization continued to accelerate the linkages between financial institutions it also magnified the systemic risk of overleverage in a single asset class which would inevitably rupture were that to happen i believed that it would be a global phenomenon that would profoundly change the world and that we should get all industry constituents together in one place to take a closer look because globalization is ultimately unstoppable this is why it continues to be the context of of our event and why our program is focused on how its forces are reshaping the housing ecosystem so we adapted giddens’ idea to hold his lectures in different cities and began a mobile event to address the reshaping at hand we moved our forums to a different country each year to show how globalization and the notsoinvisible hand of wall street was driving change in all housing markets around the world our initial event in  was held in madrid  because i believed that spain would get hit worst were the implosion to occur eurocatalyst  was held in lisbon as portugal was the largest issuer of mbs in europe that year eurocatalyst  was held in berlin to highlight much to their chagrin the implosion of german banks that year we moved eurocatalyst to rome in   the year in which italian issuance and debt reached its highest level fearing the worst that year we also launched an additional event europeservicing to bring attention to the urgent need to improve the servicing operations of european banks and market players by  we decided not to hold eurocatalyst at all  and instead dedicate our efforts to servicing emphasizing the need for default servicing we held europeservicing  in london at the british academy of film and television arts and themed all sessions to film titles our closing session was “crash when wall street meets high street in the city which way do you turn” in  eurocatalyst was held a final time in europe back in madrid  one month after the liquidity crisis of august  that led to what everyone still calls “the crisis”  the problem with calling it a crisis is that it implies a beginning and an end there is no “end” to this it was not “the perfect storm” as most analysts referred to at the time it was climate change the burning man project the burning man project is a highly participatory annual gathering in nevada’s black rock desert which celebrates the creation of a temporary city in which its members engage in radical selfexpression and self reliance the event is a dynamic and collaborative laboratory that changes every year in its themes massive temporary installations and villages at the end of each event a massive wooden effigy “the man” along with practically the entire city is burned to the ground   and its influence  while no one runs around naked and sandcovered at our event the participatory collaboration of burning man lays the intellectual foundation for the experiential focus of our event in this foundation lies the greatest influence from the festival its motto “not every experiment works but we’ll never know if we don’t try” as i began putting the event together in  the euro had just been launched as an electronic currency january   and the euro banknote was about to be introduced as legal tender january   the world stood puzzled at what would happen as twelve european states ceded their sovereign destiny to a central bank with no political infrastructure to support it it struck me as the greatest social experiment in our lifetime but one whose procedures appeared backwards were they attempting to build a roof to a house who had no foundation to me the lack of calculation showed the extent to which globalization demanded urgent economic integration among smaller countries to compete in a globalized world of course not every experiment works take for instance brexit but we’ll never know if we don’t try burning man also influenced my choice in playing “burning down the house” as the opening song for the event each year it is a deliberate editorial commentary on the myopia of the housing finance industry in particular and corporate behavior overall it is also a warning about globalization and the havoc that it would and continues to wreak on an industry entirely largely unaware ofand therefore unprepared forit and after all our event is one featuring “talking heads” at this point you’ll recognize the editorial references “burning down the house” by the talking heads  watch out you might get what youre after  cool babies strange but not a stranger  im an ordinary guy   burning down the house   hold tight  wait til the partys over  hold tight  were in for nasty weather  there has got to be a way  burning down the house  heres your ticket pack your bags  time for jumpin overboard  the transportation is here  close enough but not too far  maybe you know where you are  fightin

catalyst for bringing silicon valley together and continues to be the primary catalyst for gatherings in whichever sector she directs her interest as a friend and mentor to me when i could not

characteristically downplays esther’s achievements for a more robust history of esther’s accomplishments see wikipedia one of the best articles about the power and influence of esther dyson in technology can be found in this  wired magazine article release  the long now foundation established in  by the most influential “digerati” in science culture and technology the long now foundation strives to promote longterm thinking in today’s fast accelerating culture as a counterpoint to what they see as the “pathologically short attention span” of civilization the foundation has established a year clock as an icon for public discourse in  they established a series of  seminars with a narrative of longterm perspective hoping to help make such thinking common and automatic rather than rare and difficult with some of the most fascinating discussions amongst the most brilliant minds in the world the long now foundation is an extraordinary opportunity for anyone who wishes to participate participation is open to anyone who wishes to join and i highly recommend doing so and its influence i am very proud to be member  of the foundation and was introduced to it by esther dyson in  the premise activities and ideas have been instrumental in changing the way that i view the housing industry and its comprehensive viability and sustainability for an industry that extends credit thirty years into the future it is shocking that we possess no longterm planning committees or organizations for this reason in  i established the c nonprofit americatalyst idea lab while the organization carries many goals the primary intention of the idea lab is to establish a longterm thinking committee focused on the viability sustainability and balance in the housing ecosystem joseph stiglitz in his  nobel prizewinning work on asymmetry of information economist joseph stiglitz and his colleagues akerlof and spence focused on imperfections of information and how pervasive imperfections in information can lead to pervasive failures in the market according to stiglitz one cause of these imperfections can be stated very simply but often goes overlooked different people in a market know different things in applying this theory to mortgage markets as early as  it was already clear that the sellers structurers and arrangers of mortgagebacked securities and later cdos knew more about the performance and characteristics of their portfolios than the investors who were buying them the pace of deal flow led most investors to rely exclusively on ratings instead of performing their own due diligence   despite the fact that every single industrywide  mbs conference had sessions with both rating agencies and investors complaining incessantly about the lack of transparency and information in mbs transactions this also occurred at eurocatalyst from  up to  and we have the video footage to prove it it is absolutely true that brokerdealers heavily engaged in “ratings arbitrage”a strategy entailing the exploitation of competitive and profitdriven rating agencies by driving business to the agency willing to assign the highest rating to each deal i explicitly called out the practice in the funding session description in our  lisbon program we subsequently lost financial support from rating agencies with the exception of fitchratings for the indiscretion of exposing it in black and white despite knowledge of this explicitly implicit practice as well as increasing complaints about the opacity of mbs issuances issuers rode shotgun up the ltv curve and down the credit curve around the world investors continued to buy and investment banks forged ahead in building vertically integrated machinery for more mortgage product and volume around the world  ultimately investor pursuit of higher yields trumped the paucity of information and in  stiglitz’s theory was proven george soros the concept of “reflexivity” in social science was developed by the philosopher  karl popper illustrated in the work of giddens and applied to economic theory by george soros reflexivity is a very dense topic and difficult to summarize in this editorial suffice it to say that it is a way of understanding causes and effects in which the relationship between the two does not flow in just one direction rather the agents in any event affect each other bidirectionally both the apparent causes and effects create each other’s existence that is perhaps neither what appears to be a cause or what appears to be an effect can really be understood so simply when investigated under the microscope of a critical mind let us apply this to the changes we’ve undergone in real estate in a real estate bubble the precipitating trend has been cheaper and more available credit what turns this trend into a bubble is the misperception that the value of the collateral is independent from the value of credit in fact they are not independenttheir relationship is reflexive the relationship flows both directions in that the more available the credit the greater the increase in property transactions and the rise in house prices the same is true for equity leveraging et voila the bubble driven by cheap housing credit the overleverage of homeowners and financial institutions and the globalizationdriven interconnectedness of those financial institutions led to an implosion of the global economy in the case of mortgage markets the predominant “efficient market hypothesis” which states that all relevant and available information is represented in market prices was not only discredited but disproven while soros’ reflexivity theory continues to receive criticism from economic standardbearers i would point out that soros’ theory predicted the “crisis” and preceded it  endnote  on april   my eurocatalyst business partner and eurocatalyst event producer shirley jackson  and i had just wrapped up our last european event europeservicing  which was held  in london at that time the unthinkable collapse of housing markets was gaining momentum in the us and its effects were already in full force across europe for me it was time to sell my home in the netherlands and return to the us after  years abroad although i had written to both joseph stiglitz and george soros to speak at the eurocatalyst event each year starting in  soros graciously sent other speakers from his organization to the event in his stead but he never spoke himself as for stiglitz my annual and lengthy requests went unanswered  i knew from the outset that my efforts could never stop the inevitable however i did feel a certain degree of disappointment that eurocatalyst did not make a dent in stemming the tide furthermore because my ideas and visionin essence my body of workwere incorporated into the event each year rather than in highprofile papers or public editorials and because our events were not open to media the only awareness of them was among our alumni in the continual process of research for each year’s program and reaching out to new speakers who are entirely unfamiliar with me my own history or this event they most often assume that i am nothing more than “a conference producer” and know little to nothing about the topics or content one can only imagine the frustration in those moments of frustration i remind myself that this extraordinary occurrence actually happened when shirley and i arrived uncharacteristically early at heathrow airport for our flight back to amsterdam we ran downstairs for coffee at the starbucks in the arrivals area while there i noticed a chauffeur holding a sign with the name joseph stiglitz on it i went over and asked the chauffeur when “joe” would be arriving the chauffeur told me that he was expected soon but didn’t know who he was or what he looked like so i volunteered to find him i disappeared into the arriving crowd and found an exhausted stiglitz fresh off of a flight from south america i seized the opportunity to introduce myself and blurted out “i’m the one who has written to you for six years asking you for help in applying your theory about asymmetries of information to mortgage markets at my conference and you never responded and now look at what has happened where were you” smooth wasn’t i joe stared at me for a minute then a glimmer of recognition appeared on his face as he said “yes toni moss eurocatalyst you know you were right i should have been there” as he walked off with his chauffeur i turned to shirley and asked “did you hear that tell me you heard it” she assured me that she did in fact hear the whole “episode” as we went up the escalator to departures i told shirley “now if only i could meet george soros these past six years would be complete” shirley responded “i guess stiglitz wasn’t enough huh” wellnot really but while showing our passports to security in the unusually empty and private british airways’ fast track security area one other person miraculously appeared it was in fact george soros when i introduced myself soros was a bit confused the previous year i was supposed to have played tennis with him in dublin but was turned away at the reception desk when the local pro realized that “toni moss” was actually a woman soros never knew that i had been turned away nor did he realize that while i had been a professional tennis player in my youth i was the same person from eurocatalyst that had been writing to him about reflexivity and asking him to speak at our event for the past six years once he realized that i was the same person he said “you know you were absolutely right we both saw it coming i hope you made a fortune trading on it” he then shook my hand again and patted me on the shoulder as i watched him walk off to catch his flight i thought to myself “made a fortune trading on it hell no i just produced a damn event about it” ps seriously what are the odds of running into those two in one place within ten minutes of each other it’s too bad that there were no iphones in  and all i had was a blackberry otherwise i would be posting the selfies wonderful experience we were educated enlightened and entertained  the three es to a successful conference we had several deals that flowed out of the conference making a great success for us  bill woahn presidentsecure capital network americatalyst was very well done a

meadows local transit petition – please sign click below for the latest news and  friends’ positions on issues facing our valley… click here for friends’ latest news background ever since the formation of the friends of squaw valley in  we have sought a balanced development approach aka “a goldilocks solution”…not too big and not too small to protecting the environment and quality of life in squaw valley and acknowledging the legitimate economic interests of the developer that was the challenge suggested by supervisor montgomery several years ago we have stayed true to that goal up through and including our presentation to the board of supervisors at the november   meeting when the board voted  to  to approve the environmental impact report and the specific plan without change since that decision the focus of attention and action shifted to the legal process as expected the conservation group sierra watch has filed a lawsuit against the developer and placer county to quote from their press release “placer county failed …to adequately analyze or mitigate the project’s numerous significant environmental impacts including direct indirect and cumulative impacts on water supply hydrology and water quality traffic and air quality the lake tahoe basin fire and emergency hazards climate change biological resources historic resources night sky and scenicvisual resources noise and population and housing” sierra watch believes their position is “rock solid” their goal as stated “is not simply to prevail in court but more importantly to bring people to the table to come up with a blueprint for squaw that we can all be proud of” as stated earlier the friends of squaw valley will not engage in an independent lawsuit to challenge the board’s decision however many of our members will be financially and emotionally supporting the sierra watch action as will scores of others who signed petitions wrote comment letters and who are outraged by the decisions of the planning commission and board of supervisors  if you agree with the legal challenge we suggest that you financially support sierra watch httpkeepsquawtrueorg  we expect sierra watch’s legal battle against placer county and squaw valley ski holdings to be contentious expensive and lengthy while this is going on the friends of squaw valley will use every opportunity it can to underscore our mission statement from  “the friends of squaw valley is a forum whose mission is to advocate for environmentally sustainable economically viable and aesthetically compatible development in squaw valley while preserving its community character” our position with regard to the environmental impacts has been and remains the same the problem of traffic already often at gridlock has not been solved by money the permanent increased noise issue is not solved by the speculative and questionable mitigation of applying rubberized hot mix asphalt to our main road the entrance to shirley canyon would be adversely impacted by tree cutting and placing fractional homes in currently undeveloped critical aquifer recharge zones squaw creek would be permanently threatened by locating the heavy maintenance facility with its hazardous and toxic chemicals as well the “propane tank farm” next to the stream the mountain adventure center a  foot high  square foot indoor water park runs contrary to our squaw valley ethos and culture the requested year timeline approval window is way too lengthy for this community especially because this developer will likely be gone within  years recreational drivers change and certainly will be different in the next quarter century  and climate change science is real and is not meaningfully addressed in this proposal nor has the developer made any commitment to
