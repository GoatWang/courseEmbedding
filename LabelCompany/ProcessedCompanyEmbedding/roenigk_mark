am very excited to present this interview with mark roenigk the chief operating officer of rackspace for those who may not know rackspace is a web hosting and cloud computing company that has grown very fast and has created a tremendous amount of customer loyalty and endearment  in this interview be sure to read our other interviews in our leadership series we’ll learn about how rackspace has placed the customer at the center of their activities and the role the rackspace employees play in making the organization focused on the customer we’ll also learn the role of process improvement within the context of their internal nps program which is also very respected and known for its rigor and effectiveness in helping the firm remain focused on the customer i also have a bit of a disclosure mark and i have known each other for many years he has been a very close friend and mentor and i have learned much and continue to learn from him akin to graphite plus pressure plus time produces a diamond that’s how i see my relationship with mark aside from being an exceptional professional and executive he is downtoearth humble and a good man i’m grateful he’s accepted this opportunity to share with us some of the secret sauce that has made rackspace such a beloved company and an nps powerhouse  mark thanks for taking the time to answer a few questions for those who may not know rackspace can you share a little about the company and also please share with us a little about yourself and what role you play at rackspace rackspace is a hosting and cloud computing company founded in  in san antonio rackspace is the founder of openstack the standard opensource operating system for cloud computing and a founding member of the open compute project we are known for our renowned fanatical support which we deliver to more than  business customers from data centers on four continents i serve as chief operating officer at rackspace responsible for the computing platforms on which rackspace delivers products services and support i started my career as an engineer at compaq before moving into management later holding senior leadership roles at microsoft intuit sirius xm and ebay i came to rackspace in  because i was drawn to the culture and the inspiring mission to be one of the world’s leading service company  rackspace is well known for its fanatical focus on the customer the first rackspace core value is “fanatical support create customer experiences that create emotional attachment” why is that important and how does rackspace accomplish that core value let’s face it we sell technology an abundant commodity that can be created sold and purchased with minimal human interaction from multiple providers so being in the technology market we at rackspace had to ask what is our differentiator what is our claim to fame how can we add value and keep our customer coming back we have chosen fanatical support® to serve as that differentiator at rackspace we know that customer satisfaction and building longlasting relationships with our customers is our most important objective satisfied customers will tell their colleagues about rackspace becoming promoters for our brand and an external sales force for our company therefore fanatical support is essential to our business it is what lies at the core of our company because we know it’s essential to our success our customers run a lot of very different businesses and we don’t expect them to all be tech savvy that’s our job we ensure that we have diverse talent with deep expertise to help our customers solve problems and learn more about the best solutions for their needs  let’s talk about your nps program when did rackspace begin its nps journey and how is it going nps is a metric that measures customer loyalty by asking them to answer one question based on a scale from  to  how likely are you to recommend rackspace to a friend or colleague we’ve been asking this question in one form or another as far back as  when the original harvard business review article was published however we quickly realized that just asking the question and calculating a score doesn’t get you very far we track customer’s responses to detect positive or negative shifts in their satisfaction so we can reach out to a customer directly if need be this way nps is not a static number instead it is a realtime assessment of our company’s performance and success a strong nps program needs a great deal of underlying discipline in how we analyze feedback and take action the program matured a bit more beginning in  since then we’ve continued to tweak our approach and each business unit has customized aspects of the program to fit their needs we also use nps to examine our internal employee engagement as well our internal performance on back office functions – what we refer to as “rackers serving rackers” understanding satisfaction within our own four walls led us to be listed this year as no  in fortune’s “ best companies to work for”  lanham napier rackspace ceo has called nps the “greatness metric” what does he mean by that additionally it’s been said that mr napier reads customer openended responses every day is that really true if the ceo connects with customers in that way how does that customercentric behavior from the top down affect the rest of the company lanham is a strong communicator – his messages resonate powerfully with rackers a critical theme over the past several years has been about the difference between good and great companies and the focus necessary to ensure a path to ‘great’ his message is simple and speaks to the fact that so many metrics we see today reflect a company’s path to ‘big’ without representing customer sentiment ours is a loyalty strategy and lanham believes the path to greatness comes through earning ’s and ’s from all of our customers  his specific quote is “greatness is achieved when customers say we are great” lanham has been reviewing customer feedback every day for a long time transparency is a core value here and we are very open with customer voice at rackspace randomly selected responses are distributed routinely and it’s not unusual for lanham to call these customers directly to say “thank you” or offer his help to customers with negative feedback the rackspace board of directors also reviews nps feedback in their quarterly meetings it’s definitely an effective leadership tool and it helps hold rackers across the organization accountable for doing the same  it’s one of several mechanisms for keeping a customer focus  rackers what is a racker was the name deliberately chosen “customer service rep” is the more common title – why is racker better than using csr customer service rep explains a job function within a company that involves interaction with customers through technology at rackspace all employees are rackers not just those who deal directly with the customer a racker is someone who embodies our core values has a commitment to service and is dedicated to the vision of the company it is more than a label like lawyer accountant or customer service representative being a racker allows our employees to create a shared identity despite the job function they perform and it creates a companywide sense of camaraderie in fact we call our onboarding process “welcome home” symbolizing the ultimate feeling of belonging the moment you start as a new hire our customers pick up on this sense of community as well and it provides a sense of reassurance to know they have such a unified workforce behind them  rackspace has an internal lean six sigma program tell us how nps and lean six sigma work together at rackspace to improve the customer experience nps is a critical input to the voice of our customers  rackspace utilizes nps feedback to determine high impact areas for improvements in our products and services  business leaders partner with operational excellence lss program and the nps team to strategize how to make these improvements for our customers these opportunities are taken to our “racktivity room” a space where crossfunctional teams meet to solve problems and innovate through a series of “racktivites” lean six sigma  innovation games and program management tools teams create solutions to make these opportunities a reality  is there anything else you’d like to share we have passionate rackers innovating the industry in open standards and fanatical support every day because they are truly passionate about the success of our customers this kind of culture is the reason the whole industry is buzzing about hybrid cloud right now a combination of public cloud private cloud and dedicated bare metal computing powered behind openstack  we are able to offer customers massive gains in performance reliability security and costeffectiveness that aren’t seen with other service providers
