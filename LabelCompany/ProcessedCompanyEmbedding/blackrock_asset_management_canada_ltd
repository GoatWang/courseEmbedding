announced that effective today all ishares products traded on the toronto stock exchange will feature dividend reinvestment plans drips for clients who wish to efficiently and automatically reinvest their distributions the move affects the entire product line of  ishares exchange traded funds etfsthere continues to be a thirst for income but many investors also want the flexibility to simply and swiftly redirect yield back into their etf investments drips will give them exactly that flexibility said mary anne wiley managing director head of ishares blackrock canada when we acquired claymore earlier this year we committed to build on our record of innovation and client responsiveness todays announcement is just one example of ways in which were making good on that promisetoday the canadian ishares business remains the market leader in etfs with  per cent market share and  billion in assets under management since the close of the claymore acquisition flows for most of the former claymore funds have also increased under blackrock management and carrying the ishares brand aggregate sales inflows across all former claymore funds have increased by  from march  september  when compared to aggregate sales inflows during the same time period last year  million in  versus  million in roughly  per cent of corporate mergers fail after announcement we have beaten those odds and succeeded in our vision to bring these two great canadian etf providers together under one roof to best service the needs of investors continued wiley we knew the strength of the claymore products under the ishares brand was going to be a success the results to date have exceeded even my expectationwith a commitment to meeting the needs of canadian investors in addition to the recent delivery of drips ishares has also launched six new etfs and extended its range of tools to help investors manage and overcome current market uncertaintieslaunched a suite of minimum volatility etfs to offer riskaverse investors access to equities across domestic international developed and emerging markets to capture potential market upside while seeking to minimize the risk they take on introduced the ishares us high dividend equity index fund cadhedged xhd to help investors access higher yield equities xhd offers investors potentially higher yield and lower risk by focusing on companies that are likely to pay higher than average dividends for the foreseeable future the response to xhd was so overwhelming this product gathered over  million in aum within the first two weeks of coming to market this past august embarked on a crosscanada tour speaking with advisors and conducted proprietary research of highnet worth investors to better understand and service client needs fully integrated all products into isharesca this month to align product information details  delivering greater transparency and insights to the market across the entire product set these actions are in addition to the successful integration of the claymore products and team members as well as the appointment of a new head of ishares canada earlier this year currently etfs only make up seven per cent of the overall fund assets in canada but they are growing at an explosive rate and are set to continue to grow in popularity given the market conditions and our ambition i see no reason why etfs cant grow to the

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds deletor subject mid predicate mid object midliteral languagecode csv
