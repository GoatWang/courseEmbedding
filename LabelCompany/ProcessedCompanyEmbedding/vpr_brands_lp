brand” said kevin frija ceo of vpr brands lp we’re excited about our new trajectory and believe that our focus on the honeystick brand will lead to increased sales of our branded products which should translate into increased margins and ultimately profitabilitythe first quarter was a true transitional quarter where the company made the switch from distributing popular vaporizer brands and liquids to building expanding and focusing on the honeystick brand and further expanding its presence in the cannabis space i believe this transition was in the long term best interest of vpr brands lp and look forward to the further emergence and expansion of the honeystick brand as well as our portfolio of cannabis business said dan hoff coo of vpr brands lpalthough our sales are not segregated by brand or product category our primary revenue source is from vaporization devices specifically created for use with medical cannabis and recreational marijuana these devices are specifically created for use with extract oils and concentrates which are vaped providing optimal results and the best experience for patients and recreational users vaporizers are far more convenient and discrete compared to traditional cannabis use methods these units are compact easy to carry and concealable modern cannabis vaporizers do not emit distinct and lingering odors that are affiliated with traditional marijuana use we believe that portable vaporizers are the fastest growing delivery mechanism for marijuana our team is currently working with other market leaders within cannabis growth

november    vpr brands lp vprb on behalf of the company i am pleased to give our shareholders a day corporate update regarding the recent acquisition of the wholesale operations and assets of vapor corp vpco we are excited to inform our shareholders that the transition of our management and business operations are proceeding on schedule the companys wholesale division along with current product lines have never stopped generating revenue since we took over the transition has been seamless and this is partly due to the fact that we kept many of the former employees and sales associates on board while strategically lowering costs by eliminating corporate redundancies and creating a business culture that is efficient and fiscally responsibleon the corporate side it is important to note that vprb has no toxic debt the company has a very low float of  and is widely held by insiders and management under my previous management we were able to uplist vapor corp from pink sheets all the way to the nasdaq in  just prior to my departure our management is again focused on building shareholder value while increasing sales and profit margins on our product linesthe current brands under

regards to the legal medical and recreational cannabis markets we have heavy market penetration in california colorado oregon connecticut and minnesota as well as service and have accounts in washington nevada michigan new mexico alaska  vermont‎ and illinoisour products are sold in dispensaries with both private label and our flagship honeystick brand the company has aligned with key partners in the states whether on the extraction or distribution side to service dispensaries within each market we will be providing further updates on these partnerships but expect our cobranded items to be rolled into the market in q as stated previously we are fully operational at the original vapor corp offices and warehouse‎ located at  griffin rd in ft lauderdale fl and have even negotiated a reduction in our monthly facility rent by  per month the core team employed in the wholesale operation of vapor corp have been integrated into vpr brands lp vprb assuming similar roles in sales and logistics this is important as it will preserve continuity in the business allowing for the preservation of current customer relationships additional continuity is being preserved because all the brands trademarks websites and customer accounts were also transferred over to vpr brands integration has been going smoothly and the wholesale and distributor accounts are pleased to have original vapor corp management back‎ at the helmvapor corp name recognition existing relationships with both suppliers and customers since  is one of the longest running in the industry and is invaluable to vpr brands lp vprb vapor corp has previously sold to over  of the countrys largest distributors and retail chain store customer and has existing vendor  s with these accounts it is our goal to reignite our business relationships with all the previous customers who helped make our products the most widely recognized in the industry under my previous management of vapor corp sales peaked close to  million in although vapor corp was once among the strongest in the industry previously reported revenues for their wholesale business dropped from a reported in the first quarter of  by approximately  to a reported  for the nd quarter ending jul   considering the acquisition of the vapor corp wholesale business occurred at the end of july  vpr brands will report only two months of acquired wholesale business in this coming rd quarter  prior to the acquisition vpr brands previously reported  in revenue for the nd quarter related to sales of its helium brand eliquidread morethe timing of the acquisition of vapor corps wholesale business was also very important within the ecigarette and vapor industry significant upheaval is occurring due to a change in regulatory treatment by the fda of these products the government had set august   as the cutoff date of any new product from being introduced at retail in the us without first receiving premarket approval from the fda it is expected this provision will allow for products that were currently available prior to august   to remain in the marketplace likely through  considering that no new products are being allowed to come into the marketplace current wholesalers such as vpr brands are especially wellpositioned to provide product to retailers and consumers via online assetsthere is a massive shift occurring in the market for electronic cigarettes and other related products where several years ago the major use of electronic cigarettes was as a replacement for traditional cigarettes the prevalence of using electronic cigarette technologies for the consumption of cannabis is quickly sweeping the marketplace whether for traditional tobacco product use or as a delivery mechanism for either medical or recreational cannabis usage there is simply no debate about the sheer size of this market and the growth the market has experienced we are positioned to be a large part of this industrysincerelykevin
