and steve steach refinery manager right the transition ceremony marked the takeover of the exxonmobil plant in torrance by the new torrance refining company july   brad graverson  staff photographer by nick green daily breeze posted   pm pdt  updated on   comments pbf ceo tom nimbley spoke at the transition ceremony for the new torrance refining company as it takes over the exxonmobil plant in torrance july   brad graverson  staff photographer pbf energy officially assumed ownership friday of the exxonmobil torrance refinery bringing an end to the oil giant’s catastrophic final  months in charge of the aging plant after a february  explosion shattered the confidence of residents in the company’s ability to operate it safely pbf unveiled new whiteandblue signs at a brief ribboncutting ceremony friday while pledging to operate the plant now called the torrance refining co refinery in a safe reliable and environmentally responsible manner “i really have empathy for the people of torrance” said ceo and chairman tom nimbley “it’s been a difficult  months for them torrance was always viewed as the best refinery in the state it’s our intention to get it back to that level”the pledge of reliability was put to the test early when company and city officials struggled to remove a securely fastened covering to unveil the sign a burly worker eventually gave it the requisite hard tug to finish the jobassemblyman david hadley put the event in context in a statement read by former councilman tom brewer now a member of the republican’s district staff “let’s be honest about this” he said “this is not a celebration it’s a transition this is not a victory lap it’s a chance for a new beginning here in torrance and we’re cheering you on to succeed“your predecessor lost significant confidence and goodwill in the community in recent years” hadley’s statement said “it’s sad to say this but that’s true we want you to succeed and we’ll cheer you on but we want you first and foremost to protect the safety of the people in the south bay”exxonmobil’s safety record since the blast frightened many members of the community and prompted the formation of no fewer than three grassroots groups that are demanding safety improvements both state and federal investigators have blamed exxonmobil for the blast including citing a deliberate decision not to fix equipment the company knew could cause a lifethreatening explosionthe state has fined the company more than  while the us chemical safety board issued subpoenas to the company in an effort to uncover more information in the blast’s wakeexxonmobil has appealed the fine and numerous state citations while also ignoring some csb subpoenas much to the anger of politicians like rep ted lieu dmanhattan beach a former torrance city council member advertisement the south coast air quality management district also is conducting a study to determine whether an alternative to extremely toxic modified hydrofluoric acid is viable for use at the refinery the acid forms a toxic groundhugging gas at room temperature that could kill thousands in the densely populated area during an accidental releasecsb officials have said a catastrophic release of the acid was only averted during the explosion when debris hit scaffolding erected for future maintenance around a large vessel containing mhf exxonmobil has only reluctantly communicated with city residents since the explosion largely when compelled to by government officials holding public hearings on the explosionno exxonmobil official played a formal role in friday’s ribboncutting although a member of its public relations staff was on hand to take photospublic confidence was further eroded by a series of relatively minor accidents since the magnitude blast that literally rocked the city showered neighborhoods with industrial debris and increased gas pump prices the incidents included an accidental release of highly toxic modified hydrofluoric acid and just last week the collapse of a ton crane pbf already has taken steps to improve community outreachworkers friday were seen tending to the unkempt landscaping around the refinery that was a source of complaints by community leaders before last year’s explosion convinced many they had bigger problems to deal with at the plant than aestheticspbf has also used delays in the ownership transfer — originally scheduled to close in the first quarter — to reach out to a variety of community organizations including “a lot of groups our predecessor did not have a dialogue with” said jeffrey dill president of pbf energy western region llc “everything falls into place when the refinery is running reliably people are kept safe we are a good member of the community and that’s the place we want to be” dill saidin addition pbf has committed to an independent thirdparty review of the refinery to see if any improvements are recommended and plans to extend an automated monitoring system of the mhf unit to the city fire department dill said that monitoring system is already tied in to equipment at the aqmdwith the  million purchase of the barrelperday refinery that was announced last year pbf increases its refining capacity to about  barrels of crude a day making it north america’s fourthlargest independent refiner in addition to the acre north torrance refinery pbf has acquired a network of pipelines storage facilities and distribution terminalsthose pipelines send crude oil from the ports of long beach and los angeles to the refinery while jet fuel is sent from the refinery to los angeles international airportpbf also acquired a mile crude gathering and transportation system which delivers san joaquin valley crude oil directly from the oil field to the refinerydill said pbf

news fire hits torrance refinery in california ioc restarts newly upgraded coker at barauni refinery  qatar commissions ras laffan refinery  fire hits torrance refinery in california houston feb   by robert brelsford ogj downstream technology editor south coast air quality management district and torrance refining co llc torc a subsidiary of pbf energy inc parsippany nj are investigating the cause of a weekend fire at torc’s bd refinery in torrance calif the localized fire which broke out at about  am local time on feb  in a crude unit was quickly contained by plant personnel and extinguished within  min with help from the torrance fire department scaqmd said in a series of releases no injuries occurred as a result of the fire but the refinery did have to burn excess gases through a flare stack causing excess air pollution in the area according to scaqmd which remained on site throughout the day to investigate the incident other than the affected unit the refinery continues to operate but a cause of the fire still remains under investigation said scaqmd which has called for a special hearing to discuss concerns about impacts to air quality resulting from a series of recent upsets at the processing site “i’m very disappointed in the frequency of breakdowns unplanned flaring accidents and fires at the torrance refinery and i’m concerned about the impact of these incidents to community residents” scaqmd governing board chairman william a burke said in feb  release last year power interruptions led to three unplanned flaring events at the torrance manufacturing site in march september and october the latter of which required the city of torrance to issue a temporary shelterinplace order as well as scaqmd to issue torc a notice of violation for causing a public nuisance after receiving  complaints from nearby residents according to the agency scaqmd also referenced the february  explosion and subsequent fire at the refinery under former owner exxonmobil corp which shuttered the plant’s fluid catalytic cracker for more than a year and nearly resulted in a release of hydrofluoric acid into the surrounding area ogj online may   feb   “the refinery must step up its efforts to reduce the frequency and severity of these episodes” burke said scaqmd the regulatory agency responsible for airpollution control for all of orange county as well as portions of los angeles riverside and san bernardino counties said it will announce plans in the coming days for the proposed special community hearing awkward timing the feb  fire comes just days after torc agreed to an scaqmd administrative order that requires the refinery to help reduce air pollution by taking specific steps to improve the plant’s ability to better withstand power interruptions that could result in flaring incidents adopted at a feb  scaqmd hearing the order of abatement stipulates the torrance refinery must meet specified timelines to enhance its backup power capability as well as demonstrate the reliability improvements that will stem from torc’s proposal to construct a dedicated underground power supply line at the site the agency said in a feb release while scaqmd acknowledged the complexity of the refinery and electrical grid system means the process of installing an underground power line could take  years with costs in excess of  million the administrative order requires the refinery to meet the following milestones and deadlines • within  days complete a public outreach and community relations plan including updates to the torrance city council and the torrance refinery community advisory panel • within  days develop a computer model to demonstrate how proposed upgrades from the current kv electrical system to a kv system will improve electrical reliability at the refinery • within  days provide refresher training and simulations for refinery workers for procedures during loss of power • provide evidence that existing backup power supply systems are maintained and working • within  days complete evaluations of critical safety devices and certain utility systems and within  days of completing the evaluations implement improvements identified scaqmd’s hearing board will conduct a status hearing on sept  to review the refinery’s progress in meeting the order’s initial milestones and deadlines the agency said contact robert
