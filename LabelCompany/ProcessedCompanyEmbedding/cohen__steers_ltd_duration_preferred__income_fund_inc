or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes a return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income” the source of all distributions paid by the fund including net investment income is subject to change this is because the fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts reits and similar companies distributions from reits are attributed to various sources including net investment income capital gains and return of capital the estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the reit securities held by the fund the fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from gaap  the final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after yearend and reported to you on form div and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above form div which is mailed after the close of the calendar year will specify how the distributions paid by the fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return eg ordinary income return of capital and capital gain important information not fdic insured • may lose value • no bank guarantee leverage represented as a percentage of the fund’s managed assets as of the most recent month end leverage is created whenever a closedend fund has investment exposure in excess of its net assets the use of leverage is speculative and there are special risks and costs associated with leverage the use of leverage increases the volatility of the funds net asset value in both up and down markets the fund seeks to enhance its dividend yield through leverage but there is no guarantee that the funds leverage strategy will be successful   expense ratios as disclosed in the fund’s most recent annual report to stockholders dated december   expense ratios are net of waivers andor reimbursements portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice the mention of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation for any person to buy sell or hold any particular security top ten holdings are determined on the basis of the value of individual securities held

day’s market close of regular trading on the nyse generally  pm eastern time on each day the nyse is open for trading distribution rate is calculated dividing the last distribution paid per share annualized by the market price note that the number of income distributions is based on the fund’s distribution payment frequency ie monthly or quarterly a fund may pay distributions in excess of its net investment company taxable income and to the extent this occurs the distribution yield quoted will include a return of capital the estimated return of capital for each distribution is also available on this web site by clicking on the distributions tab on each fund’s landing page sec yield is calculated by dividing annualized net investment income per share during a day period by the maximum offering price per share as of the close of that period sec yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities since certain distributions received by the funds from real estate investment trusts reits may consist of dividend income return of capital and capital gains and the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the year the sec yield has been adjusted for the funds that invest significantly in reits based on estimates of return of capital and capital gains quarterly distribution per share is as of the most recent quarter  end the fund pays regular quarterly cash distributions to common shareholders at a level rate that may be adjusted from time to time based on the projected income of the fund the amount of quarterly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors including changes in portfolio and market conditions each fund’s distributions reflect net investment income and may also include net realized capital gains andor return of capital return of capital includes distributions paid by a fund in excess of its net investment income and such excess is distributed from the fund’s assets under federal tax regulations some or all of the return of capital distributed by a fund may be taxed as ordinary income in addition distributions for funds investing in real estate investment trusts reits may later be characterized as capital gains andor a return of capital depending on the character of the dividends reported to each fund after yearend by reits held by a fund however please note that distributions are subject to recharacterization for tax purposes and the final tax treatment of these distributions will be reported to shareholders after the close of each fiscal year on form div risks of investing in preferred securities investing in any market exposes investors to risks in general the risks of investing in preferred securities are similar to those of investing in bonds including credit risk and interestrate risk as nearly all preferred securities have issuer call options call risk and reinvestment risk are also important considerations in addition investors face equitylike risks such as deferral or omission of distributions subordination to bonds and other more senior debt and higher corporate governance risks with limited voting rightspreferred securities may be rated below investmentgrade or may be unrated  belowinvestmentgrade securities or equivalent unrated securities generally involved greater volatility of price and risk of loss of income and principal and may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic or competitive industry conditions than highergrade securities risks associated with preferred securities differ from risks inherent with other investments in particular in the event of bankruptcy a company’s preferred securities are senior to common  stock but subordinated to all other types of corporate debt  throughout this presentation we will make comparisons of preferred securities to corporate bonds municipal bonds and year treasury bonds  it is important to note that corporate bonds sit higher in the capital structure than preferred securities and therefore in the event of bankruptcy will be senior to the preferred securities  municipal bonds are issued and backed by state and local governments and their agencies and the interest from municipal securities is often free from both state and local income taxes  year treasury bonds are issued by the us government and are generally considered the safest of all bonds since theyre backed by the full faith and credit of the us government as to timely payment of principal and interest risks of investing in closedend funds risks associated with investing in closedend end funds generally include market risk leverage risk risk of antitakeover provisions and nondiversification in addition shares of many closedend funds
