r pennington julie s elmer bradley arant rose  white llp birmingham al for mony life insurance company of america a corporation defendant opinion myron h thompson district judge plaintiff ivey gilmore filed this lawsuit in the circuit court of barbour county alabama against defendant mony life insurance company of america alleging several alabama statelaw claims stemming from his purchase of a variable annuity contract from mony gilmore seeks to represent a class of persons similarly situated to himself mony removed the lawsuit to this court under the securities litigation uniform standards act of  slusa publ no   stat   usca § pc and  usca §  this lawsuit is currently before the court on gilmores motion to remand and monys motion for summary dismissal or judgment on the pleadings for the reasons that follow the court will deny gilmores motion and grant monys pursuant to slusas directive that all such class actions be based exclusively on federal law lander v hartford life  annuity insur co  fd   nd cir i factual summary the facts as alleged by gilmore are as follows gilmore opened an individual retirement account ira with mony the ira provided for tax deferment on investment earnings however a mony sales agent told gilmore that in order to invest in mutual funds on a taxdeferred basis through his ira he would have to purchase a variable annuity the agent recommended that gilmore purchase a mony variable annuity called the flexible payment variable annuity contract which gilmore then purchased gilmore however did not need the variable annuity in order to receive income tax deferral on mutual funds or other investments in his ira on december   gilmore filed a complaint in the circuit court of barbour county alabama against mony he asserted statelaw claims for unjust enrichment money had and received conversion breach of contract negligentandwanton training negligentandwanton supervision breach of fiduciary duty deceit and continuing deceit gilmore seeks to represent a class consisting of  all persons throughout the united states who have purchased a variable annuity from mony in a tax deferred qualified retirement plan  all persons throughout the united states who were charged unnecessary fees for double tax deferral for variable annuities held in qualified retirement accounts and  all persons throughout the united states who were sold variable annuities while owning a tax deferred qualified retirement plan from mony gilmore requests compensatory damages totaling   for himself and for each putative class member mony filed a notice of removal in this court on january   gilmore filed a motion to remand on february   on march   mony filed a motion for summary dismissal or judgment on the pleadings ii discussion mony removed this lawsuit based on four theories of federal jurisdiction first according to mony gilmores claims are superpreempted by slusa and therefore gilmores lawsuit is removable under  usca § pc second mony contends that gilmores claims are superpreempted by the employee retirement income security act of   usca §§  third mony contends that gilmores lawsuit presents a federal question because federal tax laws form an integral element of his statelaw claims and fourth mony contends that the court has diversity jurisdiction over gilmores claims gilmore disagrees with each of monys theories under slusa a private party cannot maintain certain classaction lawsuits alleging violations of state law in connection with the purchase or sale of securities specifically subsection b of § p of slusa provides no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging —  an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or  that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security  usca § pb and subsection c of § p provides that a classaction lawsuit brought in state court that satisfies subsection b is removable to federal court any covered class action brought in any state court involving a covered security as set forth in subsection b shall be removable to the federal district court for the district in which the action is pending and shall be subject to subsection b  usca § pc as a result subsections b and c together provide for the removal and dismissal of certain lawsuits based on state law through slusa and other statutes congress intended to preempt state law and provide national uniform standards for the securities market and nationally marketed securities lander v hartford life  annuity insur co  fd at  mony contends that gilmores lawsuit is subject to removal and dismissal because it satisfies the requirements of subsections b and c in response gilmore argues that the mony variable annuity is not a covered security as required by slusa in subsections b and c of § p instead gilmore contends that mony is an insurance company that is regulated under state insurance laws and that the mony variable annuity is an insurance product in addition according to gilmore even if the mony variable annuity satisfies the definition of a covered security the mccarranferguson act  usca §§  operates to preclude the construction of covered security to include insurance products such as the mony variable annuity gilmore does not dispute that his lawsuit is a covered class action as required by subsections b and c of § p therefore for purposes of resolving the motions currently before the court the only issue in dispute is whether the mony variable annuity is a covered security the slusa adopts the definition of covered security given subsection  of  usca § rb see  usca § pf subsection  provides exclusive federal registration of investment companies  a security is a covered security if such security is a security issued by an investment company that has registered or that has filed a registration statement under the investment company act of   usca § rb subsection  contains three requirements each of which must be satisfied in order to have a covered security  there must be a security  the issuer or the security must be an investment company and  the investment company must be registered or have filed a registration statement under the investment company act of  see  usca § rb the court will examine whether each of these elements is satisfied in the present case in securities and exchange commission v variable annuity life insurance company of america  us   sct   ledd   the supreme court considered whether variable annuities are securities there the securities and exchange commission sec sought to enjoin variable annuity life from issuing its variable annuity contracts to the public without registering them under the securities act of  and complying with the investment company act of  see  us at   sct at  the sec maintained that the variable annuities are securities and therefore must be registered see id at   sct at  variable annuity life responded that its variable annuities are contracts of insurance and thus are expressly exempt from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws see id at   sct at  it also argued that even if the variable annuities are securities the mccarranferguson act bars the sec from requiring their registration because variable annuity life and the variable annuities are regulated under state insurance laws see id at   sct at  agreeing with the sec the supreme court held that variable annuities are securities not insurance and therefore that neither the mccarranferguson act nor the exemptions to the federal securities laws save variable annuity lifes variable annuities from the secs registration requirements see id at   sct at  in reaching its holding the supreme court began by comparing traditional fixed annuities with variable annuities see id at   sct at  the court found that fixed annuities offer the annuitant specified definite amounts beginning with a certain year of his or her life see id at   sct at  in contrast with variable annuities premiums are invested more heavily in stocks and benefit payments vary with the success of the investment policy see id the holder of a variable annuity cannot look forward to a fixed monthly or yearly amount in his advancing years it may be greater or less depending on the wisdom of the investment policy id the supreme court acknowledged that actuarially fixed and variable annuities are calculated by identical principles see id specifically with each type of annuity the issuer assumes the risk of mortality from the moment the contract is issued see id even so according to the court the dispositive difference between the two types of annuities is that absent some guarantee of fixed income the variable annuity places all of the investment risks on the annuitant none on the company while the fixed annuity places those risks on the company id at   sct at  that difference precludes variable annuities from being insurance because the concept of insurance involves some investment risktaking on the part of the company id at   sct at  insurance requires a guarantee that at least some fraction of the benefits will be payable in a fixed amount see id although the companies that issue variable annuities assume the risk of failure they do not guarantee anything to the annuitants except an interest in a portfolio of common stocks or other equities an interest that has a ceiling but not floor id at   sct at  as such the court concluded that variable annuities present the issuer with no true underwriting risk the earmark of insurance see id at   sct at  in securities and exchange commission v united benefit life insurance company  us   sct   ledd   the supreme court expressly clarified the implications of variable annuity life there the sec sought to enjoin united benefit life from offering its flexible fund annuity contract without undertaking the registration requirements of federal securities laws see  us at   sct at  the flexible fund is a deferred annuity plan having characteristics similar to those of the variable annuities in variable annuity life see id however the supreme court found that there are significant differences between the flexible fund and the variable annuities at issue in variable annuity life see id united benefit life claimed that these differences bring the flexible fund within the optional annuity contract and insurance company exemptions of federal securities laws see id at   sct at  to resolve the issue the supreme court examined the characteristics of the flexible fund see id at   sct at  it found that the major part of the flexible fund is invested in common stocks see id prior to the flexible funds maturity purchasers are entitled to their proportionate share of the flexible fund and may withdraw all or part of this interest see id the purchasers are also entitled to an alternative cash value measured by a percentage of their net premiums see id at the flexible funds maturity the purchasers are entitled to receive either the cash value of their policies or a net premium payment which is a certain fixedamount payment life annuity see id at   sct at  in the district court the parties agreed that the provisions of the flexible fund dealing with the operation of the fixedpayment annuity at maturity were purely conventional insurance provisions and thus are beyond regulation by the sec see id at   sct at  however the sec argued that the portion of the flexible fund that dealt with the prematurity or accumulation period was separable and constituted a security see id the district court rejected the secs position and found that the entire flexible fund is an insurance contract because it provided a guarantee of a fixedpayment annuity see id relying on variable annuity life the court of appeals affirmed see id the appellate court read variable annuity life to hold that the company must bear a substantial part of the investment risk associated with the contract in order to qualify its products as insurance see id at   sct at  the appellate court held that the flexible fund met this test because of the funds net premium guarantee and conversion to payments element which included an interest element during the fixedpayment period see id at   sct at  the supreme court reversed see id at   sct at  the supreme court agreed with the sec that the flexible funds accumulation period is separable and must be assessed independently of the maturity period see id at   sct at  the court reasoned that the accumulation period and the maturity period present two entirely distinct promises and their operation is separated at a fixed point in time see id at   sct at  specifically during the accumulation period united benefit life promises to serve as an investment agency and allows the policyholder to share in its investment experience id at   sct at  in contrast during the maturity period united benefit life is acting in a role similar to that of a savings institution see id under these circumstances the supreme court held that the accumulation portion of the flexible fund does not constitute insurance see id at   sct at  while the guarantee of cash value based on net premiums reduces substantially the investment risk of the contract holder the assumption of an investment risk by the company cannot by itself create an insurance provision id at   sct at  the supreme court stated that the appellate court read variable annuity life too narrowly when it interpreted that decision to have turned solely on the absence of any substantial investment risktaking on the part of the insurer see id at   sct at  the united benefit life court further held that the accumulation provisions of the flexible fund constitute an investment contract under federal securities laws see id at   sct at  as such the supreme court concluded that the accumulation provisions of the flexible fund are nonexempt securities and must be registered with the sec see id at   sct at  under united benefit life the touchstone for determining whether a variable annuity is not insurance for purposes of the mccarranferguson act and exceptions to federal securities laws is whether its issuer promises to serve as an investment agency  allowing the policyholder to share in its investment experience id at   sct at  the assumption of an investment risk by the issuer does not alone allow a variable annuity to constitute insurance see id at   sct at  in light of these principles the court will examine the terms of the mony variable annuity to determine whether it is insurance the mony variable annuity provides that the annuitant must make purchase payments to mony the annuitants purchase payments are allocated at the annuitants choice to the guaranteed interest account andor the subaccounts of mony america variable account a those purchase payments can accumulate for a period of time and create cash values for the annuitant the annuitant may chose the length of time such purchase payments accumulate and may also chose to receive annuity benefit payments in the future based upon the accumulated cash values mony america variable account a is a separate investment account of mony only purchase payments for the mony variable annuity are permitted to be allocated to the mony america variable account a the assets in the mony america variable account a are kept separate from monys other assets and accounts of mony the mony america variable account a consists of nine subaccounts the annuitant may allocate some or all of his purchase payments into one or more of these subaccounts each of these subaccounts invests in among other things money market instruments bonds and stocks the purchase payments allocated among the various subaccounts on mony america variable account a may increase or decrease in value on any day depending on the investment experience of the subaccounts  selected there is no guarantee that the value of the purchase payments  allocated to any of the subaccounts  will increase or that the purchase payments made will not lose value similarly the annuitant bears the entire investment risk for all amounts allocated to mony america variable account a subaccounts unlike the mony america variable account a the guaranteed interest account is part of monys general account purchase payments allocated to the guaranteed interest account earn an interest rate to be determined by mony but not less than   the court finds that the mony variable annuity is similar to the flexible fund in united benefit life in that it contains a portion — the mony america variable account a — which like the accumulation portion of the flexible fund places all of the investment risk on the purchaser and another portion — the guaranteed interest account — which like the maturity portion of the flexible fund offers the annuitant a fixed return this similarity to the flexible fund requires the court to analyze the mony america variable account a separate from the guaranteed interest account for purposes of determining whether the mony america variable account a is insurance or a security moreover the facts of this case warrant analyzing the mony america variable account a separately specifically only the mony america variable account a is relevant to gilmore because he opted to allocate  of his purchase payments to three of its subaccounts gilmore did not allocate any of his purchase payments to the guaranteed interest account for these reasons the court will examine the mony america variable account a separately to determine whether it is insurance or a security as discussed under the mony america variable account a the annuitant allocates his purchase payments to subaccounts each of which invests in money market instruments bonds stocks and like instruments the purchase payments allocated among the various subaccounts on mony america variable account a may increase or decrease in value on any day depending on the investment experience of the subaccounts  selected the annuitant bears the entire investment risk for all amounts allocated to mony america variable account a subaccounts in other words mony has promised to serve as the annuitants investment agency expressly allowing the annuitant to share in the subaccounts investment experience be it good or bad under similar circumstances the united benefits life court held that the accumulation portion of the flexible fund is not insurance see id at   sct at  therefore the mony america variable account a is not insurance the mccarranferguson act provides in relevant part that no act of congress shall be construed to invalidate impair or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance  unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance  usca § b because the mony america variable account a is not insurance the mccarranferguson does not preclude construing the mony america variable account a to be a covered security see group life  health ins co v royal drug co  us    sct    ledd   recognizing that the mccarranferguson act applies to the business of insurance not the business of insurers so as to not exempt from federal antitrust laws insurers actions which are not properly characterized as the business of insurance securities and exch commn v national sec inc  us    sct    ledd   stating that the mccarranferguson act applies to insurance companies only when they are engaged in the business of insurance  see also variable annuity life ins co of am  us at   sct at  the next issue is whether the mony america variable account a is a security federal securities laws define security to include an investment contract see  usca § ba the supreme court has defined investment contract as used in § ba to mean a contract transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party securities and exch commn v w j howey co  us    sct    led   the eleventh circuit court of appeals has divided the howey test into three elements   an investment of money  a common enterprise and  the expectation of profits to be derived solely from the efforts of others securities and exch commn v unique fin concepts inc  fd   th cir quoting villeneuve v advanced bus concepts corp  fd   th cir the mony america variable account a satisfies the howey test under the first prong of the howey test an investment of money refers to an arrangement whereby an investor commits assets to an enterprise or venture in such a manner as to subject himself to financial loss see securities and exch commn v friendly power co llc  fsuppd   sdfla the mony variable annuity requires the annuitant to make purchase payments for which he or she bears the entire investment risk when they are allocated to the mony america variable account a therefore the mony america variable account a satisfies the investment of money prong the second or common enterprise prong is satisfied where the fortunes of the investor are interwoven with and dependent on the efforts and success of those seeking the investment or of third parties unique fin concepts inc  fd at  quoting villeneuve  fd at  the mony america variable account a consists of nine subaccounts in which annuitants may opt to invest their purchase payments each of these subaccounts invests in among other things money market instruments bonds and stocks as such each subaccount is not dependent upon the success of either the annuitant or mony but instead upon the success of those seeking the investment or a third party therefore the mony america variable account a is a common enterprise the third howey prong requires that investors expect their profits to come solely from the efforts of others see  fd at   the crucial inquiry for the third prong is the amount of control that the investors retain under their written agreements id quoting albanese v florida natl bank  fd   th cir as discussed the mony variable annuity allows annuitants to choose the subaccounts of the mony america variable account a into which their purchase payments are invested each subaccount has a specified investment objective therefore once an annuitant chooses in which subaccounts to invest he or she effectively surrenders control of his or her money to the subaccounts managers as long as the money remains in those subaccounts in other words annuitants depend on the investment expertise of others once they designate into which subaccounts their purchase payments will be invested as a result the mony america variable annuity a meets the third prong of the howey test because the mony america variable account a satisfies the howey test the court finds that it is an investment contract and thus a security the next issue is whether the mony america variable account a is issued by an investment company the investment company act of  provides that an  investment company means any issuer which — a is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities b is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of issuing faceamount certificates of the installment type or has been engaged in such business and has any such certificate outstanding or c is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding  per centum of the value of such issuers total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis  usca § aa mony argues that the mony america variable account a itself is an issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities namely the mony america variable account a therefore mony argues the mony america variable account a is issued by an investment company in response gilmore concedes that the mony america variable account a is a separate investment vehicle of monys that is registered with the securities exchange commission under the investment company act of  as a unit investment trust which is a type of investment company however gilmore contends that mony is the issuer of the mony america variable account a and that because mony is an insurance company it is expressly exempted from the definition of investment company in support of his position gilmore relies solely on prudential insurance company of america v securities and exchange commission  fd  d cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   gilmore is correct that prudential insurance company directly addresses the issue of whether the mony america variable account a is issued by an investment company however the court is surprised that gilmore relies on prudential insurance company because that decision directly contradicts gilmores position the issue in prudential insurance company was whether the investment company act of  applies to the investment fund resulting from the sale of variable annuity contracts to members of the public by prudential insurance company of america see  fd at  the variable annuity contracts that prudential proposed to sell provide that the purchaser will make monthly purchase payments of fixed amounts over a period of years see id the purchase payments will be placed in an account managed by prudential consisting of two subaccounts see id the first subaccount the investment fund account will have its assets invested primarily in common stocks see id the investment fund will be dedicated solely to the variable annuity contract holders and its assets will not be subject to claims of any other contract or policyholder of prudential see id at  the second subaccount the other assets account is an administrative account that pays dividends to contract holders see id at  at the administrative level before the sec prudential argued that it was not required to comply with the investment company act of  because that act specifically excludes insurance companies such as itself from its scope see id the sec agreed that prudential itself is not an investment company and therefore is excluded from the act see id however the sec determined that the investment fund created by prudential is an investment company within the coverage of the act see id the sec reasoned that the variable annuity contracts render the purchasers an organized group of persons that the variable annuity contracts create a trust held by prudential for these purchasers and that the investment fund which results from the sale of the variable annuity contracts is a fund within the statutory definition see id at  as a result the sec concluded that the investment fund is the issuer of the variable annuity contracts and thus is an investment company subject to the act see id on appeal the court of appeals for the third circuit agreed see id at  before the appellate court prudential argued that the investment company act of  regulates only identifiable business entities with some sort of internal organization see id at  prudential acknowledged that it is such an entity but argued that the investment fund is not see id therefore according to prudential the investment fund is not subject to the statute see id in rejecting prudentials argument the appellate court relied primarily on the legislative history of the investment company act of  see id at  the appellate court found that the committee reports of both the house and the senate state that the investment company act of  was drafted principally on the basis of reports submitted by the sec following an extensive study of investment trusts and investment companies undertaken at the direction of congress see id investment companies referred to in these reports included those involving an agency relationship between the individual contributors to the fund and the management upon whom they confer substantially a power of attorney to act as agent in the investment of the moneys contributed the group of individual investors is not a legal entity but rather constitutes in essence a combination of distinct individual interests id quoting hrdoc no  th cong rd sess   the appellate court also found significant the fact that the reports referred to an investment company known as the alexander fund which the reports described as merely a descriptive name given to the commingled funds of numerous investors who employed w wallace alexander as their agent to invest such funds id quoting hrdoc no  th cong rd sess   under these circumstances the appellate court rejected prudentials argument that the broad statutory phrase a trust a fund or any organized group of persons whether incorporated or not refers only to recognizable business entities id instead the court found that the legislative history compels the conclusion that the investment fund is a fund as that term is used in the statute see id in so finding the court found three facts significant first the investment fund is a completely segregated account devoted to investing in securities see id second the cash for these investments is derived from payments made by the purchaser of the variable annuity contract see id and third it is the investment fund and no other entity in which the purchaser has an interest see id therefore the appellate court concluded that the investment fund is separable from the insurance company see id accordingly the appellate court further concluded that the investment fund not prudential is the issuer of these securities for purposes of the investment company act of  see id at  prudential would in fact be the writer of the contracts — the insurance and annuity promises and the obligation to set up the investment fund but the investment fund the company to which the investment interests relate is the issuer of those interests id internal quotations omitted the mony variable annuity is materially identical to the variable annuity contracts at issue in prudential insurance company specifically like the variable annuity contracts the mony variable annuity provides that first the purchaser will make monthly purchase payments of fixed amounts over a period of years second the purchase payments will be placed into one or both of two funds — the mony america variable account a and the guaranteed interest account — which are managed by mony and third the relevant fund — the mony america variable account a — has its assets invested primarily in securities and will be dedicated solely to the variable annuity contract holders and its assets will not be subject to claims of any other contract or policyholder of mony furthermore like prudential gilmore argues that the definition of investment company in the investment company act of  applies only to identifiable businesses of which mony but not the mony america variable account a is one on the other hand like the sec in prudential insurance company mony argues that it is separable from the mony america variable account a for purposes of the investment company act of  therefore the material facts of prudential insurance company are identical to those in the case at bar here the court finds that the reasoning of prudential insurance company is persuasive and adopts the reasoning of prudential insurance company and applies it here the court accordingly finds that for purposes of the investment company act of  the mony america variable account a is separable from mony mony america variable account a is the issuer of the mony variable annuity and mony america variable account a is therefore an investment company see id gilmore concedes that the mony america variable account a is registered under the investment company act of  in sum because the mony america variable account a is a security issued by an investment company that is registered under the investment company act of  it is a covered security under slusa as discussed the only issue in dispute in this matter is whether gilmores claims stem from his purchase of a covered security because the court has answered that question in the affirmative gilmores lawsuit satisfies the requirements of subsections b and c of  usca § p and accordingly is removable to this court and then due to be dismissed under slusa see lander v hartford life  annuity insur co  fd  nd cir purchasers statecourt classaction lawsuit was a covered class action under slusa variable annuity contracts were covered securities under slusa mccarranferguson act did not preclude application of slusa and as a result statecourt classaction lawsuit was removable to federal court and then due to be dismissed under slusa a separate and appropriate judgment will be entered judgment in accordance with the memorandum opinion entered today it is the order judgment and decree of this court that  the motion to remand filed by plaintiff ivey gilmore on february   is denied  the motion for summary dismissal or judgment on the pleadings filed by defendant mony life insurance company of america on march   is granted and this cause is dismissed without prejudice it is further ordered that all other pending motions are denied as moot  usca § pfa footnotes  a covered class action means i any single lawsuit in which — i damages are sought on behalf of more than  persons or prospective class members and questions of law or fact common to those persons or members of the prospective class without reference to issues of individualized reliance on an alleged misstatement or omission predominate over any questions affecting only individual persons or members or ii one or more named parties seek to recover damages on a representative basis on behalf of themselves and other unnamed parties similarly situated and questions of law or fact common to those persons or members of the prospective class predominate over any questions affecting only individual persons or members or ii any group of lawsuits filed in or pending in the same court and involving common questions of law or fact in which — i damages are sought on behalf of more than  persons and ii the lawsuits are joined consolidated or otherwise proceed as a single action for any purpose  usca § pfa  section rb provides for purposes of this section the following are covered securities  exclusive federal registration of nationally traded securities a security is a covered

security if such security is a security issued by an investment company that his registered or that has filed a registration statement under the investment company act of   usca § rb  unlike the flexible fund the mony variable annuity annuitant does not necessarily possess both portions because he may allocate   of his purchase payments to either the mony america variable account a or the

or has outstanding any security which it has issued  usca § aa issuer was defined in a materially identical manner at the time of the prudential insurance company of america decision see  fd at  n
