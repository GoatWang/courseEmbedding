with harvey kanter who took over as ceo of online jewelry retailer blue nile nasdaqnile in march of  harvey came to blue nile from moosejaw mountaineering and other retailers including backcountry travel michaels and eddie bauer based in seattle blue nile specializes in engagement rings and prides itself on educating firsttime buyers about diamond quality harvey talks ecommerce capital allocation the future of blue nile  and of retail in general  brand identity the price of gold and what hes learned about offering highend retail to chinese consumers austin smith hey fools austin smith here and im joined by harvey kanter ceo of blue nile thank you so much for taking the time harvey kanter austin its great to be with you thanks for the opportunity austin its fun to be here first lets just jump right in blue nile obviously kind of a unique model in the space im wondering if for those people that are unaware if you could just give us the foot view whats different about you guys as a business model in this space harvey thats a great question blue nile has been around for about  years we brought to the market a disruptive model that is most efficient  more efficient than traditional brick and mortar stores we offer the highestquality diamonds we provide education counsel and guidance in a noncommission environment which is really compelling our sales associates really communicate just an incredible wealth of knowledge and we do all this at  below traditional brickandmortar jewelry store prices its a really compelling model its a great place to buy a diamond actually today i would say that i dont know why you would buy a diamond anywhere else austin thats a pretty bold statement harvey it is it is austin is it that lack of overhead that gives you the competitive advantage or is that just part of the puzzle here harvey thats just really part of the puzzle we have  diamonds on site so we have a really big scale number one number two we have these supply relationships that are exclusive to us and that allows us to really work hard to bring to market the best products available the lack of overhead  to your point  we dont have sales associates we dont have brickandmortar stores and then we actually work a little shorter we dont have the carrying costs of many of the traditional brickandmortar stores when you put it all together it allows us to offer just an incredible level of value austin to put this in context for other investors out there you are like amazon to another maybe zales best buy right harvey i guess thats one way of thinking about it i think probably the only difference really the way you described it is that our focus is exclusively really on core engagement we extend into fashion jewelry but really we are very focused on what we sell as opposed to the two other retailers you talked to theyre more broadbased general merchants that focus allows us to really create scale and we are literally the worlds largest online retailer of core engagement austin obviously a disruptive model thats where the biggest growth investors are going to find is in a disruptive model like this where do you see the jewelry space in five years given where you guys are going harvey whats real exciting is theres really three critical elements i would say that are evolving in retail not only in the jewelry space one is the consumers preponderance to want to shop where they want to shop when they want to shop the internet provides access to that and mobile is the next forefront if you will for providing that consumers ability to do it where they want thats a really big deal conversely to brickandmortar stores if you think about it were not constrained by that second is really international for us international is a huge opportunity just one data point china the country marketplace is about twice the size in our core engagement business in the us we already have two offices in china were really trying to extend our relationship there we have a good brand awareness overall but that opportunity is really meaningful then the third one is just the overall marriage rate and the desire for jewelry which will never go away since the economy has started to rebound more people are getting married once again and over the next three to four years that horizon looks pretty rich we expect to continue to grow market share and really tap into that growth trajectory which is really meaningful austin three pretty big changes that are definitely going to be affecting you over the next few years you mentioned your stores in china what other things is blue nile doing to address or run at those serious changes that you talked about harvey the first one is our orientation around technology we launched a really unique way to shop online we were the first jewelry retailer to have an app we have an mdot site today were actually evolving that site to be more responsive and bringing channelagnostic interaction to the consumer over the next six months which in laymans terms means no matter what device you come to interact with us on you will have the same experience we will offer all the feature benefits of our pc on a tablet an ipad mini on an android phone or an iphone or whatever that is one of the critical elements to leverage that even greater were actually bringing new technology and new advancements to how you interact for instance a band matcher is something well launch in the next couple of weeks its the ability to actually envision what the band would look like on the ring by actually showing it well show that instore experience and well show you multiple number of bands that match an engagement setting and allow the consumer to not just envision it in their imagination but see it realtime thats somewhat disruptive no one does that today at the level that well bring it to the marketplace relative to technology were really continuing to push ourselves to interact with the consumer in the way they want to interact and to be offering kind of dimensionalize an experience in spite of the fact that it might be on an ipad austin obviously doing what you can in the mobile world then i have to ask maybe as a devils advocate here are people really going to make a purchase as big as an engagement ring on a mobile device historically it seems like something that people want to interact with before they make that big decision harvey two data points there one if you look backwards at real results weve sold over a  engagement ring off of a tablet and we typically sell  stones off of iphones its somewhat mesmerizing to me i would have said maybe the same perspective you had years ago which is is that a realistic expectation but reality is it is the second element which i think is really unique is the way people interact with mobile devices today typically most people get up in the morning immediately on the iphone or android they look at email they link to what they want to and then they go to work or they get on a pc sometimes they explore sometimes they dont but the next place is they go home on the couch instead of being tethered to a pc theyre literally on their ipad sitting on a couch what were bringing to market is the ability to have all the touch and feature functionality on that ipad so they can literally have a pc experience on an ipad as they sit on that couch typically that core engagement sale that we create is the soontobe husband and wife looking at it together theyre searching and browsing and its very fluid the long answer to your question is yeah people are absolutely shopping on an ipad our counsel our education our guidance are the levers we have to define all the elements of what makes a diamond great and all the unique ways to evaluate the purchase are all available soon either on an ipad or even today on our mdot mobile site austin as a buyer out there theres obviously a lot of options for them to buy an engagement ring  or any jewelry for that matter theres zales theres costco theres tiffany why would somebody in this space be going to blue nile harvey great question equally great answer i would tell you easy answer number one the environment we create our sales associates as i mentioned earlier are noncommissioned they are trying to give that consumer the best ability to make a great decision we spend a ton of time on education counsel and guidance its interesting but i sit in on phone calls every other week i sat on one yesterday and we as often sell them down as we sell them up because we provide the ability to make the best decision when i say sell them down im specifically referring to actually not necessarily making the biggest sale in dollar value but giving them the best quality product were helping them navigate that thats a really big difference in the context to be able to thoughtfully go through it typically a customer will come back two and three times before they actually make a purchase theyll think about the information that we provide them and then come back and ask more questions the fact of the matter is the quality of the stones we have are unequalled they are as good as anywhere in the world today literally the level of assortment we have if you go to a brickandmortar store  and youve mentioned some of those without renaming them  they might have  stones in their store we would have  stones in one specific caret size like  we have  stones the depth of our inventory is really astronomical it is the broadest assortment available today exclusively available at blue nile then we already mentioned the fact that  below traditional brickandmortar stores thats kind of the icing on the cake you get great quality feel really confident trust that you made a great purchase with a great retailer and oh by the way get a great price no better place to buy i would say austin a lot of compelling reasons for a user to look at blue nile what about an investor as an investor i look at the space and you guys are a bit more expensive than maybe your peer group i believe youre more expensive than tiffany and zales tiffany certainly has a storied tradition and heritage to them why would as an investor i look at a slightly more expensive company like blue nile harvey from an investors perspective if you buy into  and my hope is that they do  all the things that weve spent some time talking about this morning the reasons consumers buy from us those are defendable we have contractual relations with our suppliers not only contractual but theyre embedded in  years of backandforth thats a really big deal   diamonds you cant get those diamonds anywhere else those are only available at our website our entry into china which is now three years in the making we do a really meaningful part of our business there today but we expect it to be exponentially more meaningful in the future it creates a growth trajectory thats really exciting then we talked about the general trends of the marketplace  more consumers getting engaged better economic times  all those things would project growth for blue nile domestically as well its just a great opportunity to see market share growth revenue growth and with that eps growth weve talked about our success in many elements relative to the customer but if you look at the last four quarters weve had doubledigit growth each of the last four quarters and weve actually had five quarters of sequential growth that says that were on the move weve got our mojo for lack of a better way to say it and were growing austin looking at maybe today to five years out whats the biggest profit driver for blue nile today and do you expect that to be the same five years from now harvey we expect it to evolve we expect number one that the profit driver today in dollars is core engagement business it is a really meaningful part of our business the opportunity to create repeat purchase and lifetime value will grow that and extend that to what we define as life moments today our core business is driven around the engagement setting and wedding band but our opportunity is to extend that into many more life moments the extension is into places that are more profitrich margin opportunities fashion jewelry is the farthest extension and then as you peel back to our core business we have wedding bands which not only do you get a wedding band when you get married but a fiveyear anniversary is typically an eternity ring or a diamond pendant or diamond studs then in between is diamond jewelry and our opportunity in diamond jewelry is pretty meaningful our build your own business which is one of the better build your own practices out there is really meaningful customers can come onto our site pick from our  diamonds a stud earrings a pendant and a lot of different ways to build jewelry whether its which metal which diamond the size of the stone then we have an upgrade program which allows them to upgrade to a bigger stone if they want down the road all of those are opportunities to grow margin and grow margin dollars most importantly so we look at the next five years as pretty meaningful austin what sort of a margin dynamic are we looking at there harvey our core margin is around  thats our company rate our nonengagement margin is higher than that we typically talk about that being twice the margin rate of our core engagement loose diamond business we ended up at  ones slightly south ones slightly north but thats part of our model our margins are in a good way significantly less than our competitors but that brings that transparency of our pricing to market and the value that we create austin a lot of the companies that weve looked at in the consumer goods space are looking to asia particularly china for growth in their bigticket items companies like apple general motors coach all making a big push there youre no different im wondering if you could discuss maybe the opportunity that you guys see there but also the difficulties that come with it harvey great question the opportunity is as chinas economy really comes online and the investments being made in that country really allow the consumer to upgrade so many elements of their lives what they purchase the lifestyle they live the westernization if you will of china is really demonstrably moving and exponentially we expect it to move faster that for us is really about the ring historically chinese consumers werent oriented around a singlestone center stone larger rock today they really are theyre much more interested in the quality and the westernization and the engagement setting being a traditional american style setting thats our core business and thats where theyre headed that as i mentioned is twice the addressable market of the us so thats really exciting for us from a why do business there in terms of doing business there the economy and the way consumers interact today with retailers is actually distinctly different some elements are in how they pay for things they dont use as pervasively as we do in the states credit cards we have a partnership we launched almost a year ago now with a partner in china and he has storefronts we dont actually have storefronts we are part of his storefront but blue nile is on the door we actually create the ability for the consumers to come in and make payment in his storefronts that partner also does fulfillment for us so we manufacture the stone and we create that opportunity to pick it up instore thats another place that  in china its just not as pervasive fedexs ability to get everywhere  so many consumers feel the need not only to make payment instore but to come in and pick up instore those are some of the challenges that we face as we go into china today we have storefronts in guangzhou shanghai and beijing and the expectation is that as we grow there will be more storefronts available for pickup and delivery and we will continue to see the westernization of that consumer and the middlemarket to better than middlemarket customer becoming more affluent austin im wondering if you could comment on the collapse of gold recently and how that could impact you guys positively or negatively as you move from this engagement business toward a nonengagement  harvey yeah thats a great question as well the reality is two days after gold hit a low we revised our prices down across all of fashion and core gold product by  for us it was really important to do that it fits the value creation of why people shop at blue nile whats real exciting is our turnover  we typically turn our product which means we sell through each item  typically three to four times a year that same item we might buy and sell buy and sell buy and sell three or four times traditional brick and mortar stores might sell it once or every one and a half years we took our prices down customers got better value well go back and buy that same item three months from now and buy it at the new low price and then well sell it again and again within the span of one year well sell it four times and that other retailer that exists out there might only sell it once were bringing to market better value we took our prices down to create that opportunity and it was if you will germinated by the reduction in gold overall austin obviously you guys are very online dependent right now depending on how you calculate it online purchases are only about  of bricks and mortar purchases domestically at least im wondering if you have any sort of thoughts on the trajectory of online purchases and if there is a point on the near horizon where they eclipse bricks and mortar purchases harvey broadly speaking we believe that customers proliferation and movement to digitalbased space to practice commerce or to buy things is going to continue to accelerate our category is a place where what theyre buying is very understandable and were providing a level of education counsel and guidance that they can truly appreciate what theyre buying theres a lot of mystery thats taken out by our website the expectation is that the consumer will recognize that there are categories like ours that they can buy online and accelerate overall theyre not thinking im going to accelerate my purchases but theyre going to continue to shift to the online environment mobile only accelerates even farther weve talked about mobile openly as  of the customer traffic came to us from a mobile device in the fall its accelerated to  in q and were expecting it to be  by the end of the year when you add all of that up we expect whether the market goes to double or triple what it is today  to your point lets say its    or  is very reasonable there will always be a place for brick and mortar stores we think that that experience is important but the movement to the internet environment we think will continue to accelerate and become more meaningful austin obviously theres a big push for online sales tax amazon seems to support the measure and they are the worlds largest online retailer im wondering how something like that would impact your business should it pass or fail harvey the marketplace fairness act its hard to know what will transpire theres a lot of conversation in the government today about whether or not that should pass its made it through certain hurdles but it has a long way to go well manage appropriately through that we continue to believe and know that our model is so much more efficient than traditional brick and mortar stores that the overhead theyre burdened with  the staff and the brick and mortar itself  is something that well never have so we continue to believe well bring great efficiency to the market and ultimately give that consumer value regardless of what happens with the sales tax initiatives that theyre currently lobbying for austin now looking forward what would you say is the single biggest growth driver for blue nile in the future is it international is it nonengagement is it some combination harvey its really taking our core business and growing both share of the market as well as extending the blue nile awareness and the share of market worldwide that is and has been our core business and will continue to be austin im wondering if you could walk investors through the sort of highlevel decisions you make when you think about capital allocation it is such an important decision thats going to impact shareholder return in the future how do you go through that process harvey we really look at it from two distinct avenues one what will grow the business fastest quickest in the most meaningful way because obviously that provides the greatest level of shareholder return then in addition to that  you probably are aware we have a buyback program in place  because if theres not a great opportunity to achieve that through some means using the cash that we create then we continue to buy back stock the first one  what will grow the business quickest  weve oriented ourselves around technology as a digital player and as weve talked this morning the level of mobile as a proliferating channel the level of movement to the digital space as internet commerce those are places that we need to continue to be a leader in the industry so we continue to invest capital in that regard then the second one is our buyback program which weve bought well over  million of stock because we believe investing in ourselves is as good as any other use of capital for our shareholders austin now what would you say to doubters of your model who are just like you know what people arent going to buy expensive rings on mobile devices its too intimate of a purchase how would you respond to something like that harvey the proof is in the pudding so to speak we regularly sell stones and settings that are well in excess of most traditional stores period end of story as i mentioned earlier this morning weve sold over a  stone off tablets we traditionally regularly with some degree of  not necessarily a weekly cadence  but cadence sell  stones off of iphones and androids the customer seems the younger customer is very very accessible and even more importantly has grown up with the phone to the point where their phone is actually their pc and they dont go to a normal pc the older folks may still look at the pc as the number one place to go but younger folks today and our core customer  who is about  years old buying engagement settings  really goes to a mobile device first austin do you see different dynamics between apple or android products in terms of purchase price or mobile comfort level making that big purchase harvey without getting into specifics what i would say is that our core customer seems to gravitate more toward the apple products iphone and tablets seem to be something theyre very comfortable with the android we do a lot of business on as well but definitely the core millennial consumer the yearold consumer seems very comfortable with iphone austin i wonder if you could talk a little bit about the mobile experience you mentioned you obviously have a lot of traffic from mobile but are you also seeing a commensurate percentage of purchases or is it more complementary to the experience harvey the purchase process for the customer buying a core engagement ring is such that they come back multiple times they most often come back to a mobile device but they typically end up purchasing itself on a pc we still see that today we can see that because we see the average revenue on a pc versus a mobile device being materially higher our expectation is that as more and more consumers go to mobile devices and as we continue to lead technology in terms of developing things that work on a mobile that we will raise the level of average sale transaction and get more customers more comfortable with actually making the transaction fully on a mobile device our expectation is that it will grow over time today to the point it is more about traffic than actual sales but over time we expect more sales and the average price to continue to go up austin are there any other retailers  bricks and mortar or online only or some hybrid  that you guys really admire or you think do the retail experience right harvey the brands we most admire either we emulate them or we like to think they emulate us its really around creating trust with the customer having a relationship with the customer educating the customer and really having authenticity its not created by glitzy marketing but by actually creating a real authentic relationship the credibility that we have is probably  a perfect example our net promoter score  are you familiar with net promoter score austin yeah harvey our net promoter score is typically in the low s that is an incredible retail number its really about consumers being advocates for the brand and then telling a lot of people you earn that you cant prognosticate that were really excited about the experience we create folks like apple is a great example starbucks is a great example anthropologie is a great example jcrew those are brands that people want to be involved with really advocacy for the experience they have here creates conversations offline that people really are encouraged to want to come experience themselves austin have you thought about an apple iring harvey the apple iwatch is interesting but no we havent thought about the apple iring austin ok you guys should look into that it could be big obviously a big growth driver for you guys going forward is going to be china and there are such different dynamics in domestic versus international consumers particularly china im wondering if you would talk about what differences youve seen in the blue nile experience in china and what youre doing to adjust your strategy for that harvey thats a good question the chinese consumer actually one of the greatest examples is how distinctly different they are in how they want to engage we actually have in china now two offices which i mentioned we also have an office in dublin and then we have our call center here one of the things we find is that chinese consumers literally want to talk to someone they are not comfortable leaving voice mail they dont execute actually as often online today as the american consumer and they literally want to pick up the phone and call you we find a lot more consumers actually making a bigger transaction relative to that but we also find that the amount of handholding and educating and talking them through is really much greater than in the us without providing specific numbers the level of consumers making a purchase with us in china is really driven by the level of call interaction whereas in the states theres a much greater number of consumers very comfortable with executing the entire transaction whether it be on an iphone or on a pc thats one data point the second one probably really unique is their perspective of what theyre looking for the chinese consumer is just starting to really be driven in the middle class and the more luxury products they have an orientation that theyre learning about what it is that theyre seeking part of the call  not just the call but the product we offer and the product we actually see selling more  is not the same product thats selling in the us at this level we expect that will evolve smaller stones more gold although interestingly enough platinum is the number one metal  china is the number one user of platinum in the world  which is an interesting data point relative to our business there are unique peculiarities and our expectation is as we continue to grow and develop well understand more and more about that and the cultural differences and really evolve our business to maximize that opportunity austin you mentioned that the chinese consumer seems to want a bit more education and learning as they make these big luxury item purchases are there any other retailers that you think are doing that well in china or anybody you see stumbling harvey there are several specific chinesebased companies that we shop regularly without naming the specifics we think they do a pretty good job the difference probably between them and us is theyre still based in some form of brick and mortar entity as i mentioned our partner has storefronts and we really leverage those storefronts so it minimizes our overhead and maximizes the value that we create for that consumer thats probably the biggest difference between the competitors that we look at we also recognize that they have years in the marketplace so when we look at them we try and understand what theyre selling but the way we sell it is actually resonating really well with the consumer in china just like in the us austin recently there was a collapse in gold prices and you guys reacted almost instantly by lowering your prices by  im wondering how you guys manage the expectation for precious metal prices do you try and forecast gold prices do you expect them to remain low obviously you probably want them to stay low but im wondering how you manage that dynamic or if you just have to let the market deal you a hand harvey its interesting its a great question the reality is theres a great deal of volatility in many of the core products that are the inputs to the product we actually sell gold or silver or diamonds theres a lot of volatility but if you look over the course of time theres a relatively small but consistent movement up its inflationary we build some level of expectation that those products will continue to go up to understand how it might change our pricing strategy but then the flip side is things like golds deterioration and really big drop was an unexpected surprise in a really good way it lowers prices it allows the gold to be much more accessible and were reactive in that way theres not really an answer that we have a crystal ball and really try to project but we do have an expectation that based on history the products will continue to increase and we build models that actually think about that as we understand unit price sales margins and retails austin you guys have a very innovative model a very disruptive company a key part of that in the most successful companies weve seen is strong cultures and a fostering of creativity and the desire for growth youre trying to disrupt a very entrenched industry with very entrenched players how do you guys foster that culture to keep that drive going harvey thats a really good question the reality is that our people our associates our team is the single most important asset we have the fact of the matter is we have an incredible selection of diamonds and relationships in place a long time but none of that would matter if we couldnt bring it to market and feel really good about what were doing what ultimately that equates to is trust and loyalty we look at the consumer marketplace and the associate marketplace kind of as the same thing our culture is one of empowerment trust leadership teamwork family it sounds kind of trite on some level but the reality is its really critical our consumers trust us our associates have to trust us to the degree that runs from the consumer all the way to the associates and vice versa its a really meaningful relationship we really challenge ourselves to be as forthright with our associates as we are with our customers continue to bring that to market we have a lot of fun quite honestly one of the things that i love about the organization is we have a lot of fun its work hard play hard we work really hard to be successful but we play as hard as well maybe a great example of that is we have halfday fridays in the summers we think its as important for our associates to be able to actually go out and enjoy their family and have some downtime as much as uptime when we say work hard play hard you have to actually do something actions speak louder than words as much as were working really hard we think its important to take some time off thats just kind of one data point of how we try to create that opportunity austin what about you as an individual what sort of things do you as a leader do to keep that culture going harvey thats a really good question my days are pretty busy but theres three things i do an awful lot number one i walk around a ton im kind of an antsy guy i dont sit at a desk very well so i literally walk around the building a lot its amazing when you just engage and ask a question what you learn about the business you know that reality show where the boss goes undercover our culture is one that the openness and the level of sharing has become really a great data point for our associates to be able to share whats happening when i walk around its amazing what i learn thats number one number two being present i go to a lot of meetings its important for face time even if i dont say anything its just important that people know somethings important enough that im actually trying to sit and learn i ask a lot of questions but i also am very quiet often and i just learn the more you know about the business the more you can understand their pain points for me that makes me a better leader and a better part of the team then last but not least i spend a lot of time communicating i literally hand write  i guess hand type  an email every friday i was in asia in march and it was harveys travelogue literally i told them what i did for the week we had a board meeting two weeks ago and i recapped what the boards perspective was on what we presented because transparency with the consumer is important but transparency with our associates is important i really believe like a great marriage communication is really critical for our associates i walk around a lot i try to observe whats happening by sitting in meetings and then i communicate a lot to the extent we are as a group aligned and have a singular vision well be as efficient in how we get our work done as we are with the product we bring to market that to me is a really critical element austin we as an investment shop put a huge premium on strong leadership visionary leadership passionate leadership but not every retail investor has that experience to interact with management particularly for you guys who are webbased how as a retail investor  do you have any suggestions for how they may go about evaluating those characteristics in leadership harvey we spend a lot of time actually in market we go out and literally whether its with investors potential investors with the analysts or with suppliers and quite honestly those interactions are very public people can ask a lot of questions and theres a lot of ways to triangulate on whats happening we find it really important to spend time out there in the marketplace talking about what were doing again the proof is in the pudding right one of the data points im really excited about our turnover wasnt terrible when i got here but in the last year and a half our turnover was cut the first year by  and this year were tracking to a  reduction in turnover that is a data point a real data point that says people seem to be really happy and engaged with being part of this team austin smith has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends blue
