toward csrwire talkback  join the conversation print alerts earthwards johnson  johnson’s drive toward a healthy future we wanted to help our product development teams better understand how lifecycle thinking can result in greener products with sciencebased claims that help our marketing colleagues better tell our sustainability story submitted by guest contributor posted feb   –  am est series johnson  johnson’s earthwards promoting greener product development tags earthwards johnson johnson supply chain green sustainability environment marketing energy water five winds practice greenhealth wwf lifecycle analysis   sustainability is no longer a fleeting trend it is becoming a standard practice of companies both large and small across multiple industries here in the united states and around the world the health care sector is no different while the safety and efficacy of health and personal care products will always be paramount people today are increasingly interested in the sustainability of the products they purchase this series is about earthwards® a johnson  johnson program designed to promote greener product development throughout the enterprise you will hear from employees at johnson  johnson and its family of companies including some of the sustainability advocates who helped build and evolve the program over the years brand managers and rd leaders who collaborate to design greener products and external corporate social responsibility csr experts who will provide their own unique perspectives on sustainable product development at johnson  johnson including independent reporting by csrwires editorial director aman singh in part one keith sutter senior product director of sustainable brand marketing introduces us to the earthwards® process and gives us a peek into the origins of the program  every product has a footprint from the raw materials sourced and energy and water used during production to the impacts of packaging distribution and disposal in fact the only way to really eliminate environmental impacts would be to stop making and using products altogether but chances are we will continue to use products – whether it’s to shampoo and condition our hair place a bandage on a scraped knee take medicine when we aren’t well or be healed with the help of a surgical device every company is faced with this balancing act of making products to meet consumer needs but also addressing inherent impacts of their products so what if we change the way products are made so that they have less of an environmental impact it was this thinking that led my colleagues to introduce the earthwards process at johnson  johnson which was designed to foster product stewardship and sustainable product innovation throughout the enterprise including  operating companies across our consumer products pharmaceuticals and medical devices  diagnostics sectors we’ve made strides since the program launched in  and are proud to be providing our customers more sustainable products using our robust product stewardship effort that has been externallyvalidated earthwards® the beginning at johnson  johnson our highest priority is the health of people and the planet this is why we established healthy future  our sustainability roadmap for the future that includes enterprisewide goals to reduce our environmental impacts we’ve had specific sustainability goals in place since the early s but our commitment to the environment dates back to our origins and our credo we must maintain in good order the property we are privileged to use protecting the environment and natural resources one way we strive to reduce our environmental impact is by improving the sustainable design of our products our first venture into greener product design was in the late s when we launched a design for the environment program we had some early successes such as eliminating more than  tons of polyvinyl chloride pvc from our packaging from  but we were convinced we could go further with this and really challenge ourselves we also recognized the realities of today’s competitive marketplace in which sustainability can be a tiebreaker a differentiator or a reason to believe we wanted to help our product development teams better understand how lifecycle thinking can result in greener products with sciencebased claims that help our marketing colleagues better tell our sustainability story in  we worked with five winds international a product stewardship and sustainability consultancy to develop the earthwards process we created a board of directors and recruited product developers and brand marketers as well as external subject matter experts from organizations such as practice greenhealth and world wildlife fund to keep our process state of the art the following year we asked a group of product sustainability experts from government academia business and the ngo community to review the earthwards process and suggest improvements to our approach as a result we further integrated the earthwards process across johnson  johnson companies by setting a  healthy future goal of  earthwardsrecognized products and integration of the process into our company wide environment health and safety standards the earthwards process  scorecard today the earthwards process is helping our product development teams identify and address a product’s biggest environmental impacts we use lifecycle thinking to better understand the areas of greatest impact and guide how we should focus our efforts in most cases the greatest impacts associated with our products result from the customer use phase and endoflife disposal but depending on the product impacts related to packaging raw materials distribution and waste can also be significant to be considered for earthwards recognition product teams use our proprietary scorecard to take a product through a fourstep process satisfy prerequisites product teams ask a series of questions to gauge their general understanding of the product what materials are used in this product where do the materials come from what happens to a product after it’s used undergo screening the product undergoes a lifecycle screening to examine impacts and quantify improvements made and then it’s evaluated against  specific goals that fall into seven categories materials used packaging energy reduction waste reduction water reduction positive social impact or benefit and product innovation identify improvements a product must demonstrate more than a  percent improvement in at least three of the  goal areas five of the seven earthwards categories have two goal areas so it is possible for a product to achieve recognition by showing improvements in only two categories submit for review teams then submit the scorecard and improvement results to the earthwards board for review earthwards looking ahead as we look ahead to the next phase of earthwards we see opportunities to continue to improve the suite of tools and resources we created for the product development and marketing teams we’ve begun by upgrading the scorecard functionality and introducing an online scorecard to replace the spreadsheetbased tool we previously used this will help minimize errors and ensure the availability of data and calculations we also developed a “claims calculator” to help translate the reductions and improvements into meaningful and relevant information for our marketing teams and customers it has been an exciting few years for the earthwards team but there’s so much more to be done around our sustainable product development while we’re proud of how far we’ve come this progress is just one step in our sustainability journey toward our healthy future goal of developing  earthwards recognized products by  we are up for the challenge next aman singh reports from a front row seat to sustainability in action at jj about the author as senior product director

and disconnected from the everyday concerns of life we surely would not say that about god so why is our talk about god any differentin this engaging and accessible introduction keith johnson takes a fresh look at theology he presents the discipline of theology as one of the ways we participate in the life of the triune god without suggesting it should be removed from the academy johnson argues that theology has to be integrally connected to the traditions and practices of the church if academic theology is to be genuinely theological then it has to be carried out in obedience to jesus christ and in service to the churchunlike other introductions theology as discipleship avoids the usual overview of doctrines according to the creed which traditionally move from the trinity to eschatology johnson instead explains the content of theology by describing the christian life  being in christ hearing gods word sharing the mind of christ theology not only leads to discipleship but is itself a way of following after christ in faith product information▼▲ format paperbacknumber of pages vendor ivp academicpublication date dimensions  x  inchesisbn isbn  other customers also

gospel and earnestly intended for gods people this is theology for discipleship and it is truly theology as discipleship i learned much from reading it and i was edified and challenged by it it is a gift to us all thomas h mccall associate professor of biblical and systematic theology director carl f h henry center for theological understanding trinity evangelical divinity school this book is the prescription for all christians who doubt theologys relevance for christian living  and for all christians who wonder what theology is about and how it works keith johnson has nailed it with this fine introductory work on the practical relevance of theology for christian discipleship readers with an appreciation for theology will benefit from reading it as well the chapters on scripture express an enlightened evangelical approach to the bible as the living word of god roger e olson foy valentine professor of christian theology and ethics george w truett theological seminary baylor university waco texas in theology as discipleship keith johnson invites readers to inhabit a rich theological landscape as followers of christ johnsons book overflows with wisdom and joy as he shows how christians of all vocations are called to live in union with christ being reshaped by gods word through the spirit this refreshing book is a wonderful theological companion for disciples of jesus christ j todd billings gordon h girod research professor of reformed theology western theological seminary holland mi keith johnson has done a great service not only for the academic study of theology but for the church in a time when the churchs proclamation of its faith and the academys reflection upon faith seem to be deeply divided johnson builds a bridge across the chasm he shows not only why theology is necessary for the church but also why it can only find its true meaning when joined to the churchs life as a form of christian discipleship drawing upon the riches of the churchs past yet grounded solidly in scripture this book expounds and reflects upon the gospel as the mystery of gods will that was foreordained in christ and does so in a way that is not only deeply learned and careful but also caring and clear for those wondering why they should bother with theology at all they will find here a wise and compassionate answer for those who turn theology into a practice of intellectual theatrics or point of pride they will find here an incisive and needed corrective this book is in short a wonderful and exemplary primer to the task of theology that deserves many readers kimlyn j bender george w truett theological seminary baylor university author bio▼▲ keith l johnson phd princeton theological seminary is associate professor of theology at wheaton college his research focuses on systematic theology including the doctrines of the trinity and christology and the relationship between protestant and roman catholic theology he is author of karl barth and the analogia entis and coeditor of bonhoeffer christ and culture an ordained baptist minister he and his wife julie have one son editorial reviews▼▲ the heart of johnsons thesis is that theology is vital to discipleship because it trains us to rightly hear understand and use words about god which inevitably influence our religious practices    he closes the book with a gem a list of nine ways that theology must be practiced in order to serve the church and act as a practice of discipleship if i were the dean or chair of a confessional school i would have this list framed in the office of every theologian i employed it is difficult to correctly articulate the importance of theology as discipleship by keith l johnson not only is the book wellwritten and engaging but the content is challenging and intentionally aimed in fact to say that this book is necessary for the contemporary church would run the risk of being an understatement johnson has produced a timely and important volume that exemplifies a personal pursuit of faithfulness in the discipline of theology if you are a christian educator pastor or simply a christian seeking to live faithfully in all aspects of your life theology as discipleship is a must read booksooner than later this fine little book would be ideal for undergrad theology courses as well as congregational adult classes and bookstudy groups it would also be quite fitting and beneficial to hand a copy of theology as discipleship to the ministerial candidates in your church your favorite seminarian and your pastor and while youre handing out copies snag one for yourself youll be glad you did product reviews▼▲  stars out of   out of   stars   stars   stars   stars   star  quality  out of   out of  value  out of   out of  meets expectations  out

college johnson has an mdiv from baylor university a thm from duke divinity school and a phd from princeton theological seminary johnson has authored or coauthored a number of books including karl barth and the analogia entis tt clark  and published numerous articles related to various theological topics most recently johnson has published this timely and important volume theology as discipleship ivp academic  that seeks to build a bridge between the study of theology and the christian life theology as discipleship argues that the discipline of theology and a life of discipleship to jesus christ are integrally related because the practice of theology is one of the ways we participate in the life of the triune god p  the goal of theology as discipleship is to show how the study of theology actually enriches the christian life and how faithful obedience to christ rightly enables the learning of theology thus it is a reciprocal relationship that functions best when both aspects are equally involved johnson rightly recognizes the contemporary dilemma that characterizes most christians today for johnson the study of theology has become so divorced from the everyday endeavors of the christian life that it has become difficult even for intelligently committed christians to figure out how the two relate accordingly theology as discipleship opens with an important chapter that helps the reader identify what went wrong and how it can be effectively reconstructed it is this reconstruction process that dominates the following chapters of the book as an educator in the context of the local church i understand that the problem that johnson seeks to address in theology as discipleship is more prevalent than many are willing to admit in fact i actually just taught a sixweek course that aimed to address the very issue raised by johnson here and i wish i had his book prior to that endeavor for a number of reasons first johnson is consistently christcentered in his approach and application second his approach does more than provide a hypothetical solution to the problem third his approach and solution are beneficial to both scholars and students theology as discipleship concludes appropriately so with nine characteristics that distinguish the life of the christian who practices theology faithfully within the context of gods saving work in christ and the spirit p  for example johnson rightly argues we practice theology as disciples when our thinking stays within the limits of our faith in jesus christ p  and when we pursue both truth and unity p  this last chapter practically and carefully shows the necessity of theology for the christian life and why as christians we should be quick to engage frequently in theological dialog and thinking it is difficult to correctly articulate the importance of theology as discipleship by keith l johnson not only is the book wellwritten and engaging but the content is challenging and intentionally aimed in fact to say that this book is necessary for the contemporary church would run the risk of being an understatement johnson has produced a timely and important volume that exemplifies a personal pursuit of faithfulness in the discipline of theology if you are a christian educator pastor or simply a christian seeking to live faithfully in all aspects of your life theology as discipleship is a must
