generate consistent earnings and free cash flow growth and improve return on invested capital for the first quarter adjusted eps was  and adjusted free cash flow was  million both representing doubledigit growth over the prior year ebitda margin was  core price was  our highest level in over five years average yield was  and was strongest in our small container and large container businesses the majority of these customers are in open markets where we can leverage increases in demand for service our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform in our small container business average yield was  our highest level of pricing in over seven years first quarter volumes increased  volume growth was in line with our expectations and was broadbased across the majority of our markets volumes continued to be strong in the eventdriven portion of our business which tends to be a leading indicator for future volume growth and as expected residential volumes turned positive as we anniversary the impact of contracts not renewed during the quarter we invested  million in tuckin acquisitions and we returned  million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this included  million shares repurchased for approximately  million regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives we are now approximately have  million in annual revenue that uses a wasterelated index or a fixedrate increase of  or greater for the annual price adjustment these waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than cpi regarding our fleetbased productivity and cost savings initiatives  of our fleet now operates on compressed natural gas  of our residential fleet is currently automated and  of our total fleet has now been certified under our onefleet maintenance program the entire fleet will be certified by the end of the second quarter before turning the call over to chuck i would like to congratulate the republic team for being recognized by ethisphere as one of the worlds most ethical companies our commitment to fostering a strong ethical culture conducting our business with the highest levels of integrity and developing sustainable practices to enhance longterm value creation enabled us to be named to this elite list ill now turn the call over to chuck to discuss our financial results chuck charles f serianni  republic services inc thanks don first quarter revenue was approximately  billion an increase of  million or  over the prior year this  increase in revenue includes internal growth of  and acquisitions of  basis points the components of internal growth are as follows first average yield increased  average yield in the collection business was  which includes  yield in the small container business  yield in the large container business and  yield in the residential business average yield in the postcollection business was  basis points which includes landfill msw of  a majority of our thirdparty landfill msw business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions total core price which measures price increases less rollbacks was  core price consisted of  in the open market and  in the restricted portion of our business the second component of internal growth is total volume which increased  over the prior year volumes increased  in our large container business and  basis points in our residential business as expected volumes decreased  basis points in our small container business small container volumes included a basispoint impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers which we view as nonregrettable excluding these losses small container volumes would have increased  basis points the postcollection business made up of thirdparty landfill and transfer station volumes increased  landfill volume increased  which included cd of  and special waste of  msw volumes were flat versus the prior year the third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees which increased  basis points the increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel the average price per gallon of diesel increased to  in the first quarter from  in the prior year an increase of  the current average diesel price is  per gallon the next component energy services revenue increased  basis points the growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity and the final component of internal growth is commodity revenue which increased  the growth in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to an increase in recycled commodity prices excluding glass and organics average commodity prices increased  to  per ton in the first quarter from  per ton in the prior year the current average commodity price is approximately  per ton cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased  due to an increase in rebates resulting from higher recycled commodity prices now i will discuss changes in margin first quarter adjusted ebitda margin was  which compares to  in the prior year this change includes a basispoint increase in landfill operating costs primarily due to temporary costs associated with new operating requirements at one of our landfills these costs were anticipated and should be completed by the end of the second quarter and a basispoint margin decline or  of eps from heavy rains on the west coast in certain markets we had to close some of our facilities for several days which resulted in lower volumes and higher transportation and disposal costs excluding these temporary cost increases we had margin expansion in the quarter due to strong pricing and volume growth which demonstrates the operating leverage in our business it should be noted that the margin benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was offset by the change in net fuel sga costs were  of revenue and in line with our expectations these costs improved  basis points compared to the prior year i want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and sga expenses in our k filing first quarter  interest expense was  million which included  million of noncash amortization our adjusted effective tax rate was  resulting in  of eps benefit relative to our expectations the lower tax rate resulted from tax accounting for equity compensation we expect to be at an effective tax rate of approximately  for the reminder of the year first quarter adjusted free cash flow was  million an increase of  versus the prior year cash flow can vary quartertoquarter based upon the timing of working capital and capital expenditures i will now turn the call back to don donald w slager  republic services inc thanks chuck to conclude strong fundamentals together with solid operational execution resulted in  top line growth and doubledigit growth in both earnings and free cash flow as anticipated the current economic environment continues to be favorable for the business and were on track to achieve our fullyear goals we will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders including our customers communities employees and shareholders at this time operator wed like to open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session your first question comes from brian maguire at goldman sachs brian maguire  goldman sachs  co hey good afternoon donald w slager  republic services inc hi brian brian maguire  goldman sachs  co nice pickup from the trend you had been on the last couple of quarters up  but it was a little bit lower than some of the peers i think you talked about some of the business you shed at the small container commercial i just wondered if you could maybe give us a sense of what the volumes would have been without that and maybe more of a cleaner number then and when we would expect to anniversary some of that activity donald w slager  republic services inc yeah so couple of things on that the first thing is that the weather did have an impact on our msw volumes coming into our landfill so we posted as i said flat volume growth on msw but if you take into consideration of weather that volume growth would have been closer to  so overall i think that the impact of weather and maybe some contracts that we shed may have had a basispointorso impact on our overall volume growth charles f serianni  republic services inc yeah and let me add to that on the small container business specifically thats just a strategic decision that weve made to not continue to do business with brokers and that broker volume to us that loss is nonregrettable our perspective is that brokers dont add any real value to customers customers should be doing business with us directly a strategic decision weve made and weve been shedding some of that business now for several quarters we got little ways to go but otherwise if you subtract that to your point brian the underlying economic growth is strong were getting good price and getting our fair share growth in the business brian maguire  goldman sachs  co okay great as a followup the margins were a little bit lower than what we were expecting it sounds like maybe a little bit lower than what youre expecting too is some of the rains and landfill cost that you had there just wondering if you expect any of that to carry through into q or if you think those costs were kind of episodic just to the period donald w slager  republic services inc yeah so the cost that we talked about really related to q especially as it relates to the heavy rains were still optimistic of regarding the margin expansion this year if we look at kind of expectations for the rest of the year keep in mind that net queue although there was a headwind for us in q thats going to be a tailwind for us starting in q we do get the step up in cpi as we had talked about thats effective in the second half of the year and were going to continue to see benefits from our onefleet maintenance program which will be fully rolled out in july  of this year so we feel optimistic in terms of being able to achieve expansion in ebitda margins this year brian maguire  goldman sachs  co okay thanks very much operator the next question is from mike feniger at bank of america michael j feniger  bank of america merrill lynch hey guys yeah thanks for donald w slager  republic services inc hello mike charles f serianni  republic services inc hey mike michael j feniger  bank of america merrill lynch hey guys thanks for taking my question on the guide for the margin its good that you still expect margin expansion but are we still sticking in that  to basispoint range for the year charles f serianni  republic services inc yeah we are i mean thats still what were looking at for this year remember the headwinds we knew that the margin expansion would be more a backhalf loaded just because of the fuel and because of some of the other costs that were looking at the frontend of the year and also keep in mind that cpi price increase that we get together with the onefleet maintenance program so we knew that it would be backhalf loaded so right now mike were right on track michael j feniger  bank of america merrill lynch thats great donald w slager  republic services inc yes weve got these temporary landfill operating costs that chuck spoke of look we dont like these weather as an excuse in general we dont but when you got landfills that close for several days at a time and we had a couple facilities in the western part of the us that didnt pull trucks out for five six days that really does impact your overall operations so these are just couple of basis points were going to get back to it and again these other tailwinds that chuck described are real and thats going to come through in the second half michael j feniger  bank of america merrill lynch thats great and just to think about the mix of the business im just curious youre seeing energy services up recycling prices have been higher does the profitability on the waste mix does it start to move more to being margin accretive and do you expect that to show up in the back half charles f serianni  republic services inc yeah so we saw some of that right mike in the first quarter right so the extent that we had more revenue coming in from our ep business and our revenue coming in from commodities we saw some of that actually in q and you strip away the noise that we had in terms of the landfill operating costs and the heavy rains you actually saw the margin expansion partly due to your point to the mix of business donald w slager  republic services inc yeah and right were seeing growth now across all lines of business right we saw growth in residential we saw growth in small container net of the broker loss so on and so forth so were seeing a broader based recovery and again were seeing in all geographies so the macro is in good shape the momentum is there in the business michael j feniger  bank of america merrill lynch thanks guys operator the next question is from hamzah mazari at macquarie hamzah mazari  macquarie capital usa inc good afternoon thank you the first question is just around how much capacity do you guys have in the current demand environment what i mean by that is one of your competitors had said that they began adding routes in many markets in the nation on the commercial side for the first time since their downturn and you referenced your business is picking up just curious how much capacity you have on the ground have you been adding routes already just if you could frame that for us where you guys are at donald w slager  republic services inc we have added some routes hamzah in the few markets some markets have little more capacity than others because they were impacted more deeply by the downturn but i think its a mix bag were also very very focused on compliance of hours of service and all those other areas of the business so were employing new route tools as well and getting more precise in and around our really route standard so were going to continue to pickup productivity in the business while were also expanding the business so theres no one answer that fits every market everyone is kind of in a different state on the continuum but i wouldnt say that were at capacity across the board and as you know small container business that the new stuffs soaking pretty easily so to speak in that business and thats one of the reasons our tuckin strategy work so well because we can very often buy a four five truck company and take trucks off the street so that alone speaks to the fact that weve got capacity in the system hamzah mazari  macquarie capital usa inc right and then you had referenced brokers do you have a sense of how big brokers are as a percent of the market and has that gone down over time or is that going up i know waste management had bought oakleaf and that wasnt the great deal but just a sense of how big is the market for brokers and clearly you have some nonregrettable losses that youre still working through and thats strategic and i understand that but just trying to get a sense of the brokerage business thank you donald w slager  republic services inc so i dont think brokers are playing a bigger role in the business when oakleaf was sold to waste management we said hey someone is going to fill that vacuum somebody always does our position again is that brokers dont really offer any real value or advantage to customers we believe we should be owning that customer interface directly with all of our capabilities the breadth of our products and all of our digital tools the customers will be better served dealing directly with us and not through a broker so thats the decision we made were going to maintain it we dont see the business going other way or the trends going the other way frankly at the same time were improving our capabilities for customers around sustainability around filling their needs about being selling them solutions that they need giving them the reporting they need so some of the things that brokers used to sell above and beyond are things that we can all do ourselves now and were not done yet right so our products continue to improve our product catalog continues to expand and so little by little we think theres less and less need for brokers in the business and the market and we think thats frankly the trend hamzah mazari  macquarie capital usa inc great thank you don operator next question is from al kaschalk at wedbush securities al kaschalk  wedbush securities inc good afternoon guys donald w slager  republic services inc hi al charles f serianni  republic services inc hi al al kaschalk  wedbush securities inc and nicole nicole giandinoto koziol  republic services inc hi al al kaschalk  wedbush securities inc a little more color on the operating landfill cost i think it was a basispoint headwind is that includes  basis points from the heavy rains or is there something else that maybe you can help just articulate further what that occurred in the quarter charles f serianni  republic services inc yeah so there is  basis points associated with the landfill operating costs and then an additional  basis points associated with the heavy rains so the landfill operating costs really relate to one landfill and it has to do with intermediate cover and some other enhancements that were making to start an operating process at that landfill donald w slager  republic services inc and some of those costs we just kind of pulled forward into q from later parts in the year where they were budgeted al kaschalk  wedbush securities inc okay is this the midwest landfill donald w slager  republic services inc no its not this is actually a landfill in california al kaschalk  wedbush securities inc okay well there is a midwest in the california too anyhow secondly and this is more i guess you have concentrated or invested where youre able to get returns and its related to recycling i think overall you say there is about a   headwind for a change you got commodities that have come down here sharply i guess my point is im just trying to ask from a business and operating prospective is that the right – your commitment to that business and the impact it has on your operations correct as i thought it also had further impact greater impact one way or the other based on the dollar change  so in other words the contract changes you may have made or processing fees of – are those revisions showing up and thats why maybe there wasnt as much leverage in the model in the quarter based on donald w slager  republic services inc yeah so weve updated the market on the sensitivity as its changed it used to be greater than it is right so that sensitivity has decreased our focus on the business remains in other words weve continued to migrate our agreements with customers who deliver material to our facilities in a more fair sort of cost sharing arrangement so a good portion of those contracts have already been converted were working with municipalities to convert the collection portion of contracts to more – again a fair cost sharing arrangements that work is going to continue and were going to continue to invest in the recycle business to your point al where it makes sense with the right terms and an equitable contract and meanwhile weve still shuttered mrfs at our recycling facilities that didnt return an adequate return on capital so thats all going to continue so we still think its a good business where we have good partners specifically municipal partners who want to be forwardthinking in their sustainability plans but as you heard me say you cant have sustainability without profitability so thats our view and we think as we continue to work toward fair sharing arrangements that the volatility and the exposure will continue to come down having said that we will also probably be giving up a little bit of the upside along the way but we will have insulated the business from the volatile downturn so thats still the right way to run the business we think but its going to just happen one step at a time charles f serianni  republic services inc yeah and were still early on in the process al weve got about  of our processing contracts currently converted over to this processing fee but the majority of the material that we handle right now we actually collect on behalf of municipalities those are covered under longer term contracts so its going to take us a little while longer to cycle through those contracts but well continue to keep you updated in terms of the changes and the sensitivity analysis that we do relative to the price of commodities donald w slager  republic services inc yeah and as it relates to the overall price of commodities now they started out strong at the beginning of the year they came down in the end of march and now april but we think frankly theyre for the longterm for the full year theyre still going to be at or slightly above the rate that we guided to al kaschalk  wedbush securities inc okay and that rate is what charles f serianni  republic services inc  per ton al kaschalk  wedbush securities inc okay and finally just to cleanup how many cents were benefiting the quarter from recycling charles f serianni  republic services inc so recycling was actually a  benefit during the quarter but at the same time we had a  negative associated with fuel with net fuel so if you remember last year we called out a lag benefit that we received in q so yearoveryear theres actually a  benefit from fuel so those two kind of net out al kaschalk  wedbush securities inc right thanks a lot guys and good luck donald w slager  republic services inc thanks al charles f serianni  republic services inc thanks al operator the next question is from sean egan at keybanc capital markets sean j egan  keybanc capital markets inc hey good evening everyone donald w slager  republic services inc hey sean charles f serianni  republic services inc hi sean sean j egan  keybanc capital markets inc i just wanted to touch on onefleet now that you guys are almost completely rolled out can you help us understand maybe what proportion of the benefits that youve seen from the program either through the pl or the cash flow statement just trying to understand the tail after you are fully implemented if we continue to see benefits for another   months as the program matures or if were kind of through our total savings donald w slager  republic services inc yeah so ill start out by just emphatically saying that we havent seen all the benefits from onefleet yet okay so lets talk onefleet from a couple different views the first being capex one of the benefits of onefleet is to extend the useful life of the fleet which means aging the fleet a year which is a onetime  million savings were about halfway through that well save yet another  million from what weve saved so far so thatll happen this year and then theres an ongoing tail in other words if you maintain your fleet to now an older age indefinitely there is a  million  million a year savings every year from doing that so thats the gift that keeps on giving with onefleet thats on the capex side but thats real cash thats happening were seeing that on the operating side the goal of onefleet right is to maintain the fleet to be the most safe and efficient reliable fleets you can have that doesnt mean the youngest fleet right it means maintaining these trucks to high standard throughout their life so in the divisions the business units that have had onefleet in place the longest theyve seen the greatest benefit in their operating metrics fleet availability engine hour cost and all the other things that we measured the handful of key metrics we measured in onefleet every one of our divisions has a maintenance dashboard where they follow and closely track their metrics related to onefleet and our maintenance staff here at the headquarters works with them directly to put extra emphasis on those divisions that need additional health and support so we know the things are working we know the divisions that ive been on the longest have had the best results and the divisions that i just put on last year whore still in the certification process are still working through some of the bumps so this is a big big undertaking were still very convinced it was the right thing to do and were seeing the benefits and now were going to really work hard to find an efficient frontier of our fleet and were going to start seeing other benefits from having the most reliable fleet in the industry thats going to start showing up in areas like drive a morale and turnover in fact our driver turnover is found yearoveryear our employee engagement score is up yearoveryear all these other metrics that we measure point positively to some of the things some of the underlying fundamental things were doing so i could go on and on about onefleet but i wont because we only have an hour so were glad we did it were almost through the certification process and then well have some time and capacity to tackle another initiative to be the inflator sean j egan  keybanc capital markets inc great thank you for all that and then secondly i know you alluded to the conversions or the progress that youve made on conversions to a mega water sewer trash index or an alternate to cpi can you maybe help us understand the split between collection and disposal within those contracts and maybe kind of give your comments a little towards the disposal side donald w slager  republic services inc well i would tell you most of that is collection right but as you know we dont have a great deal of thirdparty competitive volume at our landfills because have consistently raised prices on msw at our landfill and a lot of that other volume has sort of found other homes but most of the msw volume at our landfills thats not coming in on our own trucks comes from municipalities and to your point those volumes are tied to some kind of a cpi escalator but we are working those just like were working the other collection contracts moving to an index that makes sense and so ill say this most of the more recent conversions have been with the water sewer trash andor fixed via  to  because we think thats fair and equitable and weve still been able to sell that to customers as fair and equitable and we continue to make progress and were not giving up even though cpi is improving to chucks point earlier were going to start to see some benefit from an improved cpi environment certainly come through at the end of the year were going to continue to push to an index that makes sense and meanwhile well take advantage of an improving cpi environment if that continues for us as well so its a best of all for us sean j egan  keybanc capital markets inc great thank you very much operator the next question is from michael hoffman at stifel michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you nicole john and chuck for taking my call donald w slager  republic services inc hi michael charles f serianni  republic services inc hi michael nicole giandinoto koziol  republic services inc hi michael michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc how are you lets talk about cash flow and sort of how do you get from here to there to  million youve got heck of a start but help us walk through the flows if you will to the remainder of the year given the conditions in recycling ep and the seasonal trends that could or couldnt happen how does that all play out to get to the  million donald w slager  republic services inc well like you said michael i think that were already off to a very good start and some of that has to do with the timing of capex that can be a little bit lumpy but were seeing very strong operating results obviously weve got very strong ebitda and thats manifesting itself in our free cash flow so we feel very confident with our guidance that we gave relative to our cash flow for the year michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay great how are you going to get there talk to me about how do you get there charles f serianni  republic services inc i think its execution with the rest of our plan right michael so we said that we would get doubledigit growth in earnings eps this year and in free cash flow and we demonstrated in q weve actually got that in q and so its continuing the blocking and tackling and also its the tailwinds that i had talked about right so its the net fuel its the cpi its the onefleet its all of those coming together and thats going to produce the cash flow for the year and like i said were confident right now that were going to be able to hit our guidance donald w slager  republic services inc yeah so michael this is don youve been around a long time i mean that is a complement you know that its never about one quarter and this frankly is a very good quarter this quarter is right on top of our operating plan its right on top the guidance we provided weve got a lot of momentum in the business we talk about the best pricing in years its not just this quarter that started at the end of last year we talked about the momentum in volume shifting deposit volume in all lines of business thats a trend its not just a quarter we talk about the fact that were still only at a  million household starts and we still havent hit sort of the  to year average so theres still growth to come in that business and we had a couple of things that touches in q a couple of things we didnt expect so we make some decisions ourselves to pull some cost forward thats just running the business because we dont run the business just for the quarter and you know that right so weve got ongoing strength in pricing weve got a great sales force thats pulling their way and were getting our fair share of growth and were using our pricing tools to get the best customers at the best price price per unit for new sales is up all those things are going to continue right weve got improving metrics in areas like safety and turnover and nps and of the gazillion metrics that we track many of them are moving in the right direction right but its a game of inches so were going to continue to do those things weve got as chuck said these tailwinds weve got the net fuel flipping in our favor in the second half we got cpi coming back weve got some of these other what we call temporary costs of sighting thats how we get there its just good old fashion execution getting our fair share of the growth getting better around service delivery getting better around customer acquisition getting better around safety and were going to continue investing in the business were not going to get there by taking the capex holiday were not going to get there by not covering our landfills were not going to get there by taking shortcuts were going to get there by running the business for the longterm making the business better and better and all those things are well on their way so we expect to have a solid q and a solid year weve said look were reaffirming our guidance and we expect that were going to achieve toward the higher end of the eps guidance and i think theres a lot of confidence in that statement so what else do you want to know michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc so when i look at it in the data you give us so you gave us cash flow from ops ranges and then you subtract out your ppe received plus divestitures there is a pretty healthy ramp and to get the cash flow from ops number to get to the  million and that has to come with operating leverage i mean theres no other way to make that up i mean theres not monster working capital savings so i think what i was getting after is that if i get the seasonal trend normal nothing unusual q q given what youve done with your cost i should see something in and around  billion in cash flow from ops you spend what youre going to spend theres your  million charles f serianni  republic services inc right michael and just come back down to the operating leverage that you had talked about thats whats going to drive the free cash flow thats whats going to drive the margin expansion absolutely thats baked into the numbers and thats what was baked into our guidance michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc but its not – youre not doing this through working capital this is operating leverage to the income statement i managed to pick a negative working capital and turn it into a source donald w slager  republic services inc thats exactly right charles f serianni  republic services inc yeah were not taking shortcuts theres no smoke and mirrors its good old fashion run of the business you got all these benefits of these initiatives layering in you got the momentum builds again every new unit every new ton comes in at a higher margin you got to arrest a few cost along the way you got to hit your productivity goals which we have set for the team everybody has goals in the organization right so all that has to happen but that should be a phase to do and thats what we see happening in q net of a couple of anomalies and a couple things that we kind of do ourself here but as i said the momentum is there were reaffirming the guidance its really good quarter here but we dont have our feet up on the table celebrating as soon as we hang up the phone were going to go right back to work michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay fair enough so on the landfill side if my memory serves a disproportionate amount of your landfill comes on your truck you dont take that much thirdparty charles f serianni  republic services inc well we take thirdparty but most of our thirdparty is msw tied to municipal which is price restricted right so michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc in that thirdparty what was the trend there on the yearoveryear volume donald w slager  republic services inc well are you talking about on the msw coming in thirdparty michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah donald w slager  republic services inc yeah the msw was kind of flattish but then you look at the cd was very very strong with  as i had mentioned and thats coming off of a  last year so very strong on the advent pieces that were coming into the landfill michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc so what im trying to get out a little bit is you had good frontend loader growth volume wise in your own business but your thirdparty msw which is really residential side loaders but its msw so its still the consumer is flat im trying to reconcile that how many will live with that charles f serianni  republic services inc yeah you keep in mind that those msw volumes that we had talked about were impacted by the weather and if you strip that weather out they were closer to an increase of  donald w slager  republic services inc but still its not monster growth its not   so we generally feel that landfill growth should be fairly consistent thirdparty landfill growth should be fairly consistent with the growth that we have in our core hauling business they tend to flow with each other and thats our view of the world now the only thing that sort of changes that is when were reporting price volume in aggregate it really is a revenue calculation right and so we get – theres only a little bit of noise when you compare the two based on container weights or a container is  full and those kind of things because as you know as people continue to provide or want more service increases it takes a while before you actually can convert that to revenue so theres some of that noise in the system but we still think its on a macro basis a very broad based recovery its not spiking its not happening in any big way its just happening a little at a time michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah i think the recovery is very metered because thats the nature of the housing recovery donald w slager  republic services inc yeah michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc and what i was trying to get a feel for is are you seeing a commercial business growth thats a combination of housing driving new business and your existing group business walking up service intervals and a corollary to that would be its the consumer everywhere and so your thirdparty volume into your landfill all those numbers there is a relationship to them donald w slager  republic services inc yeah i think all of those things are very well balanced and consistent with what weve seen in our business in our markets in our collection of assets historically at least over the last several quarters as weve seen a more pronounced recovery from the dark days weve seen in the past so i think its very correlated again other companies that may report may have a different set of assets some companies have a bigger landfill concentration some companies have businesses north of the border some companies have landfills in markets where theyre not particularly integrated we dont have any of that right so were more of a vertically integrated business across  markets so our business behaves a certain way but theres nothing were seeing in the trend in the macro that has us worried we think theres more to come we think you look at our positive trends in price and volume theyre not just the quarter but theyre sequential and the same thing is happening within the business when i talk about operating metrics we track there theyre improving right and were only doing  million of tuckin a year so were not spending  million  million  million  billion on acquisitions so we look a little different right but the business is performing well and were talking doubledigit free cash flow growth and doubledigit eps growth michael and thats frankly something we hadnt seen in number of years so i would say strong performance for these assets and again as i said more to come because the trends are and the momentum is in the business michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you for taking my questions donald w slager  republic services inc you bet michael e hoffman  stifel nicolaus  co inc see you tuesday donald w slager  republic services inc okay operator the next question is from corey greendale first analysis corey greendale  first analysis securities corp hey good afternoon donald w slager  republic services inc hey corey charles f serianni  republic services inc hi corey corey greendale  first analysis securities corp hey so just a couple questions and apologies if this is treading back over some things you touched on a little bit already but just to sort of set future expectations don you mentioned on the broker business theres still some more to go can you just give us a sense how much of your revenue now consists of work youre doing for brokers donald w slager  republic services inc yeah i dont know if weve given you the exact number but i think well be through it probably sometime next year okay itll sort of trickle its way out between now and the end of next year corey greendale  first analysis securities corp okay and then on the volume point i totally get different mixes and i understand the weather impact but i think just to put a finer point on one thing i think one question were going to be getting is just sort of the comp between your msw volume growth and wastes msw growth and i realize you cant really address specifically other companies but any thoughts on why because presumably they would have been hit by weather also why the delta between the kind of flattish for you and the ish that they got donald w slager  republic services inc yeah one thing i would point out is that were coming off a very hard comp on the msw side of  and im not sure what they reported last year what kind of comp theyre coming off of so that might have something to do with it corey greendale  first analysis securities corp okay i dont recall ill check donald w slager  republic services inc yeah and again were not paying as much attention to what theyre saying as what were doing so corey greendale  first analysis securities corp yeah no i totally get it and youre running your own business and the business is going well just in terms of – i think its a question people looking at both companies will ask last question i had is just chuck as far as on the cost side one thing that – not to overemphasize  basis points but the increase in the labor under sga was a little higher than i expected i think it was up about  yearoveryear is that the trend we should expect for the rest of the year charles f serianni  republic services inc no that really has to do with our customer resource centers that were in the process of opening thatll be done by the end of this year so our expectation is that salaries will come down as a percentage of revenue for the rest of the year corey greendale  first analysis securities corp because of cost savings or youre saying theres some implementation costs youre incurring now charles f serianni  republic services inc yeah thats right corey its an implementation cost thats exactly right donald w slager  republic services inc think about duplicate staffing levels and having to employ more people in the overlap and all the rest of it corey greendale  first analysis securities corp got it and remind me when should we start to see the savings coming in donald w slager  republic services inc so its next year is what we had said that youll see a full run rate of savings associated with the crcs corey greendale  first analysis securities corp at the beginning of  donald w slager  republic services inc yeah starting in the beginning of  corey greendale  first analysis securities corp perfect all right thanks donald w slager  republic services inc youre welcome operator the next question is from noah kaye at oppenheimer noah kaye  oppenheimer  co inc good afternoon don chuck and nicole thanks so much for taking the questions maybe if we could start with the dynamic around core price versus average yield suddenly when youve got both numbers moving in a positive direction it sets a strong start but if i look at the gap between core price and average yield which is a metric that you talked to it did increase somewhat in the quarter since youre getting  price i think that delta was about  i guess do we make of this that some of your recent initiatives around pricing and price capture are starting to take stronger route and how do we think about the stickiness of some of the core price increases charles f serianni  republic services inc yeah so let me just address the churn a little bit so we saw a slight increase in the churn sequentially and that really had to do with a supplemental revenue imitative that we had in place in  that we ended up anniversarying and we knew that that was coming and thats why we were very focused in on going out with additional pricing actions which help push our yield up over the  level so that might be some of what youre seeing right now and certainly thats what youre seeing in terms of the core price that weve been able to push out in the open market donald w slager  republic services inc right to your point the tools are fully deployed the adoption rate is high people are using the tools our selling rate for new sales is up so were selling new business on a per unit basis at a higher rate this year than we were last year the tools are designed to do that customer retention stay strong at  so all those other metrics are good shape and again it sometimes the benefits of these things showed slowly but they continue to provide benefit and theyll continue that through the year noah kaye  oppenheimer  co inc okay thats very helpful and then theres been a lot of discussion of the different components of volume i guess if we just backup thus far weve seen normal seasonality in the second quarter donald w slager  republic services inc yeah second quarter means it seems fine to us really we usually wait to really talk about seasonality until the quarters completed because its really mayjune where that really comes to roost probably a little bit too early to tell the frost is – theres still chance of frost in the midwest kind of thing and i know that because im doing a little construction project there and they keep complaining that there might be frost in the ground thats why they cant get things done so anyways we get to the seasonality question through sort of midmay and into june and well give you an update on the q call noah kaye  oppenheimer  co inc okay i appreciate that thanks and then maybe if i could just finish up and try to get at this msw versus cd maybe from a slightly different angle if you have doubledigit increases in cd and as youve always framed this housing starts and construction should presage over time an increase in the higher margin msw type volumes do you think that you just have some footprints in relatively younger markets or higher growth markets and that is going to take a bit more time for those msw growth rates to catch up could that be a possibility donald w slager  republic services inc well i dont know that we slice it quite that finally we talk about the various types of markets were in its a pretty good balance of urban centers and secondary markets and  of our business is in franchise market so its pretty balanced portfolio so we dont spend a lot of time analyzing that because i dont think it really does us a lot of good help from the business so im sorry i cant provide you the insight overall we look more marketbymarket how we make investments how we deploy sales force and products and how all of our markets contributing and the good news to that answer is all the markets are really doing pretty well we get a really broadbased recovery here it really is as ive shared talking about with michael hoffman i think its taking a lot longer for us to see the benefit of small container growth in this recovery we had hoped and thought we would see it sooner than we did but weve been seeing it and net of this broker issue were working through weve got decent growth there too so when all lines of businesses are contributing including your higher margin things start to make a difference for you on the margin and thats what were going to begin to see here now in the second half of the year noah kaye  oppenheimer  co inc right thanks very much for the color and see you at wasteexpo donald w slager  republic services inc thanks noah charles f serianni  republic services inc thank you operator the next question is from tyler brown at raymond james patrick tyler brown  raymond james  associates inc hey good afternoon guys donald w slager  republic services inc hey tyler charles f serianni  republic services inc hi tyler patrick tyler brown  raymond james  associates inc hey chuck just to be clear so the landfill operating cost headwinds they sunset at the end of q charles f serianni  republic services inc yes thats right patrick tyler brown  raymond james  associates inc okay and then was the lack of the cng tax credit a notable drag charles f serianni  republic services inc it was a drag thats part of that drag that we called out that  of eps about  basis points at that that was all part of it patrick tyler brown  raymond james  associates inc okay okay charles f serianni  republic services inc but the big piece of it was the fuel like that the benefit that we received last year for it patrick tyler brown  raymond james  associates inc okay okay and so my last question here is just if cpi is set to help us here in the back half i mean it seems that the open market is very rational it seems like churn is lower stable why wouldnt yields be better than the   here in the back half donald w slager  republic services inc well were not there yet right historically when cpi is nor normal or in that sort of   range open market pricing is better historically so were certainly thinking about how we will go to market and will think about what the market bears and allows and will be evaluating competitive behavior and all the rest of it its too early to tell but historically yes cpi is up open market pricing is up as well so well just see what happens charles f serianni  republic services inc and well update our guidance as we always do in july donald w slager  republic services inc yeah patrick tyler brown  raymond james  associates inc sure okay all right its been a long day thanks donald w slager  republic services inc all right thank you operator at this time there appear to be no further questions mr slager ill turn the call back over to
