beverage corporation reference for business company history index beverages snapple beverage corporation  company profile information business description history background information on snapple beverage corporation po box east meadow new york usa history of snapple beverage corporation the snapple beverage corporation is the leading american retailer of singleserving iced tea drinks and the second largest seller of fruit drinks started as a parttime business in the natural foods industry during the s snapple grew dramatically after it introduced a new bettertasting iced tea product in the late s its subsequent explosion in growth in which sales more than doubled every year came as the american soft drink market shifted away from carbonated beverages toward a wider variety of noncarbonated drinks and fruit juices this industrywide movement was fueled in part by snapples introduction of healthy all natural products snapple was founded in  by arnold greenberg leonard marsh and hyman golden greenberg operated a health food store on the lower east side of manhattan his boyhood friend marsh ran a windowwashing service with his brotherinlaw golden in the early s the three founded unadulterated food products inc to sell pure fruit juices in unusual blends to health food stores products were bottled at a small plant in the new york metropolitan area the partners ran the business in their spare time while all three kept their regular jobs and the enterprise plodded along until the late s in  unadulterated foods began to market carbonated apple juice the company called the product snapple after purchasing the name for  in the first month of its introduction unadulterated sold  cases of apple juice in the second month the company sold another  cases of snapple and distributors started calling to request the product when tops starting popping off bottles in the warehouse unadulterated realized that the growing popularity of snapple might be related to the fact that the juice was fermenting outside of this brief and unintended foray into the alcoholic beverage industry however unadulterateds legitimate business had begun to grow in  the company hired its first salesman and began seeking out franchised distributors one day we woke up we realized we had a business marsh later told newsday the partners began to step up their efforts in  unadulterated expanded the snapple line to include other all natural juices in  it added natural sodas despite their relatively high price of  a bottle these products enjoyed some success in the new york boston and washington dc areas in the early s the companys three founders spent much of their time thinking up new flavors and names for their drinks each new variety of snapple took from six months to a year to develop as alterations were made in taste color and name the company strove for memorable names that were not too gimmicky rejecting for instance guava nagilah as a result of these efforts in  snapple expanded its line to include fruit drinks it was not until the following year however when the partners decided that snapple needed a summertime drink that the company hit upon the product that would allow its growth to take off iced tea in the past iced teas had been manufactured in the same way that other drinks were with flavor derived from a concentrate sugar preservatives and soda unadulterated however spent three years working with a tea vendor and a bottler to perfect a method in which tea was bottled while hot which allowed the preservatives to be eliminated we made the first readytodrink tea that didnt taste like battery acid greenberg later told the new york times we came up with the first real brewed tea that was cooked in  snapple introduced a lemonflavored iced tea made with the new process this product proved to be so popular that its sales continued even after the hot weather was gone it blew everyone away marsh explained to newsday driven by the popularity of the new iced tea product which was soon supplemented by other flavors of tea snapple sales took off by the end of  unadulterateds sales had increased by  percent over the previous  months to  million this strong growth continued in the following year unadulterated expanded the snapple line to include  different flavors and in the first six months of  the companys revenues from noncarbonated beverages increased by  percent by that fall snapple was unable to fulfill all the demand for its iced tea products and the company had instituted an allocation system to distribute its drinks only after unadulterated had contracted with a second bottling plant in upstate new york did it begin to catch up with demand at the end of the year total company sales had nearly doubled from the year before in  snapple built on these dramatic gains by introducing snapup its entrant in the isotonic sports drink market which was rolled out in four flavors in addition in an effort to break out of the singleserving market snapple introduced a ounce bottle of its beverages to be sold in grocery stores and taken home as sales of its flavored teas doubled over the course of  snapple became the market leader for this category in the new york area in an effort to enhance that position the company launched a  million advertising campaign featuring tennis star ivan lendl the company hoped that lendls active and physically fit image would appeal to consumers of its allnatural products in  unadulterated moved its headquarters from brooklyn to long island where its three founders had long lived with strong returns from flavors such as mint cranberry and decaffeinated iced teas snapples revenues more than doubled to  million with  percent of its sales in iced teas as the market for this product grew to  million the company had attained a solid second place in this field with  percent of sales behind longtime market leader lipton with  percent of the market as it expanded its market beyond the east coast introducing snapple products in california in order to expand its geographic reach further snapple needed an infusion of capital although the company had looked for a corporate partner for several years its three founding partners were unwilling to relinquish control of unadulterated and they wished to keep all of the companys operations intact rather than shedding the less successful nonicedtea product lines finally snapple reached an agreement with a bostonbased investment banking firm the thomas h lee company in january  lee formed the snapple holding corporation in delaware then in april the founders of unadulterated marsh golden and greenberg sold  percent of unadulterated to this company for  million in doing so they received guarantees that they would remain in charge of the firm and that salaries of  a year would be paid to each of them through  along with several multimillion dollar bonus payments at the time of the sale of stock with this deal snapple gained the resources to pay for nationwide distribution of its products in addition the company geared up for major competition from the leaders of the soft drink industry cocacola and pepsicola taking notice of the explosive growth of the iced tea industry coke had teamed up with lipton and pepsi with nestea to market their own iced tea products and industry observers predicted that their entry into the market in full force in the summer of  would bury upstart snapple in an effort to counteract the coke and pepsi challenge snapple began running a new line of advertisements in may  which featured its trademark made from the best stuff on earth line in ads that spoofed earlier beer and sports drinks promotions the ads received low marks from advertising industry observers in addition the company used its millionayear advertising budget to pay for a longlived series of live radio commercials featuring controversial disk jockeys howard stern and rush limbaugh at the end of the summer of  snapple conducted a fiveweek search for a new advertising agency that could better convey its corporate identity in preparation for a wider national push later that year snapple also signed tennis player jennifer capriati to endorse its products despite the competitive threat from coke and nestea which released its product in february  snapples market share continued to grow in the first six months of  the company sold nearly as much product as it had sold in all of the previous year in an effort to expand its reputation for highquality teas to its sports drink line snapple introduced teaflavored snapup in august  with its infusion of new capital snapple had expanded its distribution to every major city in the united states by august  and it signed new contracts with beverage distributors the company owned no manufacturing facilities but instead made agreements with more than  bottlers across the country in this way snapple was able to keep its overhead low and its payroll short the company administration consisted of just  employees  of whom worked out of a modest office building on long island in addition to its efforts to expand domestic distribution snapple also began a push to sell its products in foreign markets in  as a first step in this effort the company began distributing its drinks to american military bases around the world by the fall of that year these moves had started to show fruit as snapple pulled ahead of nestea to become the leader in the readytodrink iced tea market earning  percent of all sales for the first eight months of the year with these strong results snapple announced that it would sell stock to the public for the first time in december  in preparation for the stock offering snapple holding merged into its subsidiary becoming the snapple beverage corporation in the initial offering  percent of snapples stock was offered to investors with the bulk of the proceeds going to pay off debts incurred when the company was first purchased from its founders on december  the stock was first offered at  a share the offering was an immediate hit as the four million shares were snapped up and the companys stock price was driven to  these results were reinforced at the end of the year when the company posted annual revenues for  of  million more than double the previous years tally within six months snapple stock had been split twice as revenues continued to grow and the companys founders had sold another eight percent of their holdings to take advantage of the bull market in the companys shares with the introduction of lipton original readytodrink tea in the late spring of  however snapple faced a new and aggressive competitor the company tripled its advertising budget and unveiled a new campaign in an effort to maintain its standing in the market as lipton ran radio ads charging that snapples product was made from reconstituted tea powder it briefly passed snapple in market share during the key summer months before becoming unable to meet demand by the fall however snapple had regained the lead in sales in larger supermarkets earning a  percent share in addition to the threat from lipton snapples franchise as a health food purveyor was threatened when the us food  drug administration began to question the use of the words all natural on some company labels and california regulators became suspicious of the designation brewed on the companys teas in addition snapple confronted a bizarre series of rumors concerning its products one tale had it that the company supported the ku klux klan perhaps because a small k on its labels indicated that its products were kosher or because the background picture on its iced tea bottles depicting the boston tea party with masked raiders in boats had been misinterpreted another swiftmoving rumor alleged that snapple supported the extreme antiabortion group operation rescue company officials guessed that the source of this misinformation was the products longtime advertisements on the rush limbaugh show despite these worries snapples sales continued to boom the company finished  with sales up  percent from the previous year as the company moved  million cases of beverage this marked the third year in a row in which sales of snapple drinks had more than doubled one half of the companys revenues were still contributed by iced teas with the remaining portion made up by its  flavors of fruit drinks  percent and its  flavors of natural soda fruit juices and snapple sport drink these gains continued in the first quarter of  as snapple reported threemonth sales that had doubled from the year before in order to strengthen its market share snapple embarked on a program in  to expand its product offerings and to shore up its distribution system in april the company rolled out eight new flavors including mango tea three new sodas and four new fruit drinks including diet versions of popular offerings such as pink lemonade the company also introduced a larger  ounce can with these steps snapple hoped to shore up its fruit juice category which cocacola had recently entered with a line of fruitopia drinks in order to display its products more effectively snapple unveiled a new glassfronted vending machine which showed  different beverages at once the company rolled out  of these to begin with with plans to add  more in locations across the country snapple believed that the glass front of the machine encouraged impulse buying snapple took steps to gain greater control over its domestic distribution in june  at that time the company purchased two of its longtime distributors groux beverage corporation of orange county california and trinity beverage corporation based in texas in addition snapple purchased a half interest in the haralambos beverage corporation based in los angeles with these investments snapple was able to increase its percentage of direct distribution in which wholesalers sold and delivered snapple products directly to stores rather than to other middlemen who ran warehouses in this way the company hoped to gain greater control over its retail presentation and to get more shelf space as distributors themselves actually stocked the shelves by the start of the summer of  snapple had moved to a new headquarters building and increased its staff to  people in an effort to maintain the superior quality that it believed would support its market share snapple increased the size of its qualitycontrol department rapidly the company contracted with  bottlers in the united states and  in canada to produce its beverages earlier that spring snapple had also expanded its international distribution to japan previously sales had begun in canada mexico the united kingdom greece norway and hong kong the company looked to australia singapore and the phillipines for further expansion late in  by july  snapple had solidified its position as the fastest growing beverage company in the world and the second largest seller of singleserving juices growing steadily larger in a market that continued to rapidly expand although the company faced significant threats from large and powerful competitors its record of introducing popular new products boded well for its future success principal subsidiaries trinity beverage company groux beverage company haralambus

known as unadulterated food products was first conceived as a parttime venture to supply fruit juices to health food stores unsure if the business would succeed greenberg continued to run his health food store in manhattans east village while leonard marsh and his brotherinlaw hyman golden operated a window washing business in a  interview with crains new york business marsh admitted that when they launched the small business he knew as much about juice as about making an atom bomb unadulterated food products was one of the first companies in the united states to manufacture a wide line of juices and other beverages made from natural ingredients an early apple juice product led to the companys name snapple golden greenberg and marsh had created a carbonated apple juice unfortunately one of the batches of apple juice fermented in the bottle causing the bottle caps to fly off the original name of that particular apple juice product snapple which derived from the words snappy and apple became the new name for their beverage company the snapple beverage corporation beginning in the early s snapple would not manufacture their first tea lemon tea until  currently there are many different types of snapple tea  multiple flavors along with original and diet juice drinks lemonade and bottled water snapple is also bottled in the form of an aluminum can snapples brand slogan is

sold in stores but this is becoming increasingly rare lawsuitsedit in  a consumer lawsuit was brought against snapple in california the suit alleged the drinks contained unhealthy ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup and deceptive names on labels that lead consumers to believe that certain healthy elements are in the drinks that are not really present in  in a lawsuit against snapple in the federal district of new jersey the court certified to the fda for an administrative determination the question whether hfcs qualifies as a natural ingredient in  the fda responded by letter and declined to provide the court with the requested guidance stating that it would take two to three years to engage in a transparent proceeding to elicit the proper public participation the fda again cited its limited resources and more pressing foodsafety concerns in  a new york federal court dismissed a different lawsuit accusing snapple of misleading consumers by labeling drinks sweetened with

million per year profit for city schools if it were allowed to sell its drinks including juice and bottled water in school vending machines snapple was able to acquire the contract in part because new york city officials did not want to encourage the consumption of sodas which have been linked to childhood obesity diabetes and are generally considered unhealthy the snapple juice drinks specifically created to meet rules banning soda and other sugary snacks from city schools are marketed under the snapple  juiced label the flavors available under this brand include green apple fruit punch melon berry grape orange mango and strawberry lime although the juice drinks are fortified with vitamins and minerals a ounce bottle contains more sugar  grams than a ounce container of cocacola  grams dr michael f jacobson the executive director of the center for science in the public interest called the drinks little better than vitaminfortified sugar water in addition the concentrates used in the drinks apple grape and pear are the least expensive and nutritious dr toni liquori associate professor at the columbia teachers college questioned the sale of bottled water in schools saying if anything we should have cold water in our schools the deal also gave snapple exclusive rights to sell its tea and juicebased drinks in vending machines on all new york city properties starting in

much about juice as about making an atom bomb unadulterated food products was one of the first companies in the united states to manufacture a wide line of juices and other beverages made from natural ingredients an early apple juice product led to the companys name snapple golden greenberg and marsh had created a carbonated apple juice unfortunately one of the batches of apple juice fermented in the bottle causing the bottle caps to fly off the original name of that particular apple juice product snapple which derived from the words snappy and apple became the new name for their beverage company the snapple beverage corporation beginning in the early s snapple would not manufacture their first tea lemon tea until  currently there are many different types of snapple tea  multiple

featuring controversial disk jockeys howard stern and rush limbaugh at the end of the summer of  snapple conducted a fiveweek search for a new advertising agency that could better convey its corporate identity in preparation for a wider national push later that year snapple also signed tennis player jennifer capriati to endorse its products by august  snapple had expanded its distribution to every major city in the united states and it signed new contracts with beverage distributors the company owned no manufacturing facilities but instead made agreements with more than  bottlers across the

becoming increasingly rare lawsuitsedit in  a consumer lawsuit was brought against snapple in california the suit alleged the drinks contained unhealthy ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup and deceptive names on labels that lead consumers to believe that certain healthy elements are in the drinks that are not really present in  in a lawsuit against snapple in the federal district of new jersey the court certified to the fda for an administrative determination the question whether hfcs qualifies as a natural ingredient in  the fda responded by letter and declined to provide the court with the requested guidance stating that it would take two to three years to engage in a transparent proceeding to elicit the proper public participation the fda again cited its limited resources and more pressing foodsafety concerns in  a new york federal court dismissed a different lawsuit accusing snapple of misleading consumers by labeling drinks sweetened with high fructose corn syrup as all natural the court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they were injured as a result of snapples labeling snapple and new york city schoolsedit in october  snapple began its sponsorship of the new york city public school system and other parcels in the area as part of the deal to make snapple new york citys official beverage the company promised an  million per year profit for city schools if it were allowed to sell its drinks including juice and bottled water in school vending machines snapple was able to acquire the contract in part because new york city officials did not want to encourage the consumption of sodas which have been linked to childhood obesity diabetes and are generally considered unhealthy the snapple juice drinks specifically created to meet rules banning soda and other sugary snacks from city schools are marketed under the snapple  juiced label the flavors available under this brand include green apple fruit punch melon berry grape orange mango and strawberry lime although the juice drinks are fortified with vitamins and minerals a ounce bottle contains more sugar  grams than a ounce container of cocacola  grams dr michael f jacobson the executive director of the center for science in the public interest called the drinks little better than vitaminfortified sugar water in addition the concentrates used in the drinks apple grape and pear are the least expensive and nutritious dr toni liquori associate professor at the columbia teachers college questioned the sale of bottled water in schools saying if anything we should have cold water in our schools the deal also gave snapple exclusive rights to sell its tea and juicebased drinks in vending machines on all new york city properties starting in january  snapple paid the city
