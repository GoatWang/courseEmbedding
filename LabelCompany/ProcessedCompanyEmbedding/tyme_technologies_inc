therapeutics designed to exploit the aberrant metabolic characteristics of cancer cells that make them susceptible to subtle shifts in nutrient availability the companys lead candidate sm is a propriety drug cocktail that was developed to attack the altered metabolic profile of cancer cells while sparing normal tissue the company is initially targeting metastatic breast cancer patients who have exhausted all traditional chemotherapeutic and targeted treatment options cancer globally approximately  million people are estimated to develop cancer in  with roughly six million in developed countries and eight million in developing countries american cancer society this number has been projected to grow to approximately  million cancer cases and  million deaths worldwide by  driven by the aging of the global population and continued prevalence of environmental factors such as tobacco consumption which represent known drivers of cancer it is estimated that roughly  million individuals develop one or another form of cancer each year in the us and that approximately  deaths occur each year in the us from these various malignancies the national cancer institute nci which was originally established in  with an annual budget of  currently spends approximately  billion each year to research and develop cures for the different types of cancer that are now known to develop virtually every organ and tissue type in the human body is potentially prone to the development and uncontrolled proliferation of aberrant cells which is the hallmark of cancer while there are an estimated  million americans currently living with cancer or who have survived cancer ie achieved remission from disease the continued increase in incidence rates and the fact that cancer remains one of the leading causes of death globally mean that cancer remains a significant unmet medical need and a considerable public health problem one in every eight deaths is due to cancer it is the leading cause of death in developed countries and the secondleading cause of death after heart disease in developing nations world health organization existing therapeutic approaches are often either only palliative addressing the symptoms without meaningfully enhancing survival or marginally effective adding a few months or even only weeks to the patients expected survival time while remaining highly burdensome from a safety and tolerability perspective the consequences of chemotherapy and radiation are well known to the public as most people know of someone who has received either treatment safe effective treatment of cancer today remains more of a challenge than ever cancer survival rates highly dependent on cancer stage staging refers to determining how much cancer is in a patients body along with where it is located oncologists use staging to help plan treatment and to predict a patients prognosis while most cancers are staged some such as leukemia cancer of the blood are not staged as they are spread throughout the body while many staging systems have been developed the most widely used is the tnm classification of malignant tumors which is maintained by the union for international cancer control uicc such that there is one globally recognized standard for classifying cancer in the tnm system each cancer is assigned a letter or number to describe the tumor node and metastases t stands for the original primary tumor tx  tumor cant be measured t  no evidence of a primary tumor tis  carcinoma in situ cancer cells only growing in superficial layer of tissue with no growth into deeper tissues t t t t  describes tumor size andor amount of spread the larger the t number the larger the tumor andor more it has grown into nearby tissue n stands for nodes it tells whether the cancer has spread to the nearby lymph nodes nx  lymph nodes cant be evaluated n  no cancer in nearby lymph nodes n n n  describes the size location andor the number of nearby lymph nodes with cancer the higher the n number the greater the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes m stands for metastasis it tells whether the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body m  no sign of distant cancer spread m  cancer has spread to distant organs or tissues once the t n and m values have been determined they are combined to assign an overall stage for most cancers the stage is a roman numeral from i to iv where stage iv is the highest and means that the cancer is more advanced and has spread stage  also known as carcinoma in situ this is an early form of cancer where there is a flat lesion but no invasion of malignant cells into the surrounding tissue although this can develop into fullblown cancer some doctors do not consider this as cancer but precancer stage i tumors in this stage are usually smaller than  centimeters cm in diameter and are localized to their site of origin lymph nodes are not affected and there is no sign of metastasis spreading to other parts of the body stage ii tumors in this stage measure  cm but are still localized to their site of origin since they have not invaded other tissues or metastasized local lymph nodes may be affected stage ii tumors are considered to be locally advanced tumors stage iii tumors in this stage are fairly large measuring more than  cm in diameter this late locally advanced stage affects nearby lymph nodes and it may be difficult to differentiate from stage ii cancer stage iv tumors in this stage may be of any size affecting nearby lymph nodes and showing evidence of metastasis to other organs or regions of the body a secondary cancer may develop during this stage the overall physical and mental health of the patient may be affected and the historical survival rate is very low the outlook for patients diagnosed at this point in the disease represents the most clarifying indication of the importance of catching cancer early before metastasis has occurred and prior to the possible development of drug resistanceconferring mutations cancer stage is assigned when a person is first diagnosed before any treatment is given an important point to remember is that the stage does not change over time no matter if the cancer shrinks grows spreads or reappears after treatment the cancer is still referred to by the stage when it was first diagnosed however additional information may be added to better describe the current situation for example a woman diagnosed with stage ii breast cancer that had the cancer respond to treatment and disappear only to return and spread to her bones still has stage ii breast cancer the current diagnosis would just be amended to say stage ii breast cancer with bone metastases cancer survival rates are often used to describe what percentage of patients with a certain cancer would be expected to be alive after a given length of time cancer statistics are often expressed in terms of fiveyear overall survival for instance if the fiveyear survival rate for a given cancer was  that means  out of  people diagnosed with that cancer would be alive after five years while  out of every  would be dead the survival rates for patients diagnosed with stage iv cancer are decidedly sobering the following chart shows what percentage of lung cancer diagnoses are made for each stage along with the fiveyear survival rates for those stages localized is considered stage i or ii regional is stage iii and distant is stage iv the survival rates plummet for patients diagnosed with latestage disease the above chart demonstrates that while the prognosis for surviving lung cancer if it is caught in the early stages  before it has metastasized ie spread from its initial location to other sites in the body  is relatively good the likelihood of remaining alive five years postdiagnosis if the cancer is already stage iv is very poor only  this underscores the significance of the problem remaining today despite the fact that cancer patients overall are living six times longer now than they were in the s nih factsheet on cancer essentially all stage iv cancers are associated with a grim prognosis compared to earlier stages of the disease while the fiveyear survival rate is only an estimate as many factors influence the progression of disease the following table summarizes the very low fiveyear survival rates for different types of stage iv cancers with the data showing a clear need for better treatment options for these patients current treatment options insufficient for late stage cancer patients the standardofcare treatment for cancer diagnosed at its earliest stages involves localizing the problem typically patients will undergo surgical intervention to remove a tumor with the hope that the cancerous tissue can be removed entirely before it has a chance to spread surgery is often accompanied by radiation external beam intraoperative or brachytherapy both surgery and radiation can be deployed in combination with chemotherapy treatment of cancer if detected early is typically successful as judged by the high fiveyear survival rates for early stage cancers this has been aided by the huge advancements made in the development of successful cancer treatments as shown in the chart below while a multitude of anticancer agents has been developed and commercialized over the past  years they remain relatively ineffective when deployed against latestage cancers and their side effects can be considerable and highly debilitating in addition patients with stage iv cancer and their physicians choose treatment options to extend life not to find a cure as there remain few treatment options that offer the possibility of a complete response in a late stage cancer patient different types of chemotherapy remain the standard of care for late stage cancer patients however the side effects of chemotherapy can be substantial and these side effects can impact quality of life functional independence and overall wellbeing therefore we believe that therapeutics that target late stage cancer are desperately needed as there is a total lack of safe and effective treatments for patients suffering from late stage cancer sm overview tumor cells are metabolically distinct from normal cells as a direct result of the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways that are altered by different genes through mutation andor increased expression altered signaling pathways not only enable cells to adapt to tumor cell metabolism but several of these metabolic alterations are also essential for malignant transformation deberardinis et al  however these altered signaling pathways also represent opportunities for therapeutic intervention as a slight perturbation in nutrient availability is enough to send the cancer cell into distress sm is based on attacking various points of a cancer cells unique metabolic profile and  as opposed to most current cancer treatments that target one or two signaling pathways  it is designed to attack at least three separate metabolic pathways that render the cancer cell incapable of acquiring the necessary nutrients to rapidly divide this ultimately pushes the cell into senescence or cell death unlike most cancer treatments which are developed by trained medical researchers and tested in animal models sm was developed by an engineer  steve hoffman tymes current ceo  who became interested in the manner by which electromagnetic radiation killed tumor cells he scoured the medical literature in a way that was different from the approach typically taken by classically trained cancer investigators in this approach tumor cells were viewed to be vulnerable due to the aberrant nature of their metabolism and mechanisms defined in the literature were invoked both serially and in parallel to attack tumors using already developed agents also unusual was the conscious decision to eschew the use of any preclinical models to test the underlying assumptions in animals rather based upon extensive reading and an effective understanding of the medical literature a theoretical approach was developed to attack and kill tumor cells selectively while sparing normal cells and this was then tested in people thus far results have been quite encouraging  all while sparing latestage cancer patients the debilitating side effects associated with chemotherapy most of which are directly linked to chemotherapys lack of specificity ie its targeting of any rapidlyproliferating cells sm proofofconcept trial in november  luminant biosciences the precursor company to tyme filed for approval of a clinical trial for sm then known as smk with the institutional review board irb of new york downtown hospital the company enrolled  patients with advanced metastatic cancer in the singlecenter openlabel proofofconcept clinical trial the purpose of the trial was to determine the safety tolerability and efficacy of sm in subjects with advanced metastatic cancer additional exploratory endpoints were the assessment of progression free survival objective response rate duration of response overall survival and patient reported outcomes including healthrelated qualityoflife qol and diseasetreatmentrelated symptoms between january and december   subjects were enrolled into the study the patient population was comprised of  breast cancer  nonsmall cell lung cancer  pancreatic cancer  prostate cancer and one each of small cell lung hepatic tongue appendix thyroid colon and cancer of an unknown tissue of origin the patients had failed all available anticancer treatments and each was given less than one year to live patients received one to  courses of therapy with each course consisting of daily sm administration five days per week for a total of six weeks the therapy was well tolerated with all drug related adverse events occurring within the first treatment cycle with the exception of hyperpigmentation which eventually occurred in all patients drugrelated or possibly drugrelated adverse events aes were mildtomoderate selflimiting and did not require therapy and are shown in the following table it is noteworthy that common side effects of chemotherapy  such as nausea vomiting various other gastrointestinal side effects eg gi tract bleeding constipation etc hair loss anemia neutropenia thrombocytopenia immune system compromise and neurotoxicity  were noticeably absent in this trial the safety profile alone appeared to indicate that the therapy does not adversely impact normal physiological processes or harm normal cells or tissues longterm repeat dosing did not appear to increase the toxicity of the regimen which is also a substantial differentiator compared to chemotherapy in this study the most striking findings were on the level of tumor response and patient survival the last assessment of tumor responses was performed on november   and at that time  of  treated subjects were evaluable according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors recist classification guidelines therasse et al  the results are presented in the following table evaluation of target lesions according to recist is defined by the following complete response cr disappearance of all target lesions partial response pr at least a  decrease in the sum of the longest diameter ld of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum ld stable disease sd neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for pr nor sufficient increase to qualify for pd taking as reference the smallest sum ld since the treatment started progressive disease pd at least a  increase in the sum of the ld of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum ld recorded since treatment started or appearance of ≥ new lesions evaluation of nontarget lesions according to recist is defined by the following complete response  disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalizing of marker levels incomplete response stable disease  persistence of one or more nontarget lesions orand maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits progressive disease pd appearance of one or more new lesions andor unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions there are a number of ways to report clinical trial data for cancer therapies kogan et al  objective response rate orr is defined by the fda as the proportion of patients with a tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum period of time in other words cr  pr for the sm trial there was an orr of  perhaps the most striking piece of data from the sm trial was the  of patients who achieved stable disease  interestingly while most companies and investors focus on cr and orr a  study from japan in  patients with lung cancer showed very little difference in overall survival between those patients with crpr  months compared to patients with sd  months watanabe et al  in recent years a number of studies have been reporting the disease control rate dcr which is the orr  sd for the sm trial the dcr was  the dcr was shown to be a more powerful predictor of survival than orr in a lung cancer study lara et al  and in analysis of three separate breast cancer studies liu et al  it should be noted that the five of the  patients that were not evaluable were excluded not because they were deceased in fact they are all still alive but because of the strict criteria that must be met for inclusion that includes having a certain number of scans available for evaluation the excluded patients were typically missing one of the necessary scans if included in the last assessment the five excluded patients included three complete responses and two partial responses including these patients in the final analysis lifts the orr to   and the dcr to   results that are quite impressive for a group of patients with stage iv cancer it is impossible to directly compare the data from the sm study to those generated in other oncology trials with different experimental or approved therapies particularly since there was no control arm in the sm trial however it is interesting to compare the data to other studies in patients deemed refractory to at least one line of chemotherapy prior to study entry in such settings there are examples such as the following colorectal cancer erbitux irinotecanrefractory patients  pr  sd saltz et al  metastatic breast cancertykerb  herceptin  orr o sullivan et al  perjeta  orr zagouri et al  nonsmall cell lung cancererlotinib  orr vs  on placebo shepherd et al  another intriguing aspect of the data from the first proofofconcept clinical trial of sm was the longterm survival of the patients from this study as of june  more than two years after the trial began  patients were still alive and  breast cancer subjects remained alive accordingly median survival had still not been reached either in the overall group or the cohort of patients with breast cancer in an environment where nextgeneration therapeutics typically provide only a few extra months or weeks of survival benefit an approach that seemingly adds years to patients lives seems to be substantially differentiated the charts below depict the kaplanmeier curves of this population while there is no current longterm followup data from this study available it is worthwhile pointing out that even if the survival results had not improved at all from the last recorded time point survival of  years for patients with stage iv disseminated disease that had been heavily pretreated is unprecedented the meager survivalpromoting effects of currentlymarketed anticancer agents is welldocumented  a notable example is that of the roche  genentech drug avastin® bevacizumab which has achieved the following survival results in various heavily pretreated refractory patient populations advanced breast cancer no survival benefit advanced cervical cancer ↑  months advanced colorectal cancer ↑  months advanced lung cancer ↑  months advanced glioblastoma no survival benefit advanced renal cancer no survival benefit avastin® has been associated with a litany of side effects including potentially lifethreatening blood clots in the lungs hemorrhages nausea vomiting diarrhea headaches dizziness abdominal pain and reduced white cell counts the drugs cost is also a substantial drawback  currently avastin® costs over  per patient for only four to five months of therapy virtually all patients manifested dramatic and rapid improvements in eastern cooperative oncology group ecog performance status ps european organization for the research and treatment of cancer eortc qualityoflife qol measures and selfreported pain scores during the first sixweek course of treatment these changes were rapid dramatic and durable in nature as shown in the following charts for all treated patients and for just breast cancer bc patients once these improvements had occurred they persisted only one patient in this trial entered with an ecog ps of  and  patients had a ps of  after six weeks of therapy it is worth noting that the patient with an ecog ps of  improved to a ps of  during this time a dramatic improvement in selfreported pain was seen in all patients four patients entered the trial with no pain which improved to  patients by the end of the initial six weeks the impact of sm therapy on these outcome measures could be considered even more differentiating than the impact on survival because there are virtually no therapeutic agents currently marketed to treat cancer that are capable of providing these kinds of benefits to patients the eortc qlq c quality of life assessment tool incorporates nine multiitem scales five functional scales physical role cognitive emotional and social three symptom scales fatigue pain and nausea and vomiting and a global health and qualityoflife scale unlike the pain and performance status scales in which low scores are good the eortc qol goes from   worst qol to   best qol eleven of the  treated patients entered the study with excellent or nearexcellent qol ratings by the end of the first six weeks  patients fell into this category anecdotal evidence of efficacy has also been gathered from additional patients who were treated on a compassionate use basis among the more striking cases were the report of an year old male with stage iv ewings sarcoma and bone metastases who had previously been treated aggressively with surgery  including the removal of a kidney  to no avail and who was also treated with various chemotherapeutic drugs cyclophosphamide vincristine doxorubicin irinotecan and temozolomide without success and who was given weeks to live yet who exhibited a dramatic response to sm treatment and who is still alive roughly nine months postsm dosing a year old male with stage iv nonhodgkins lymphoma nhl who was refractory to radiation chemotherapy and targeted therapy brentuximab vedotin known by the trade name adcetris® at the time of treatment with sm who achieved a complete response after less than two months on treatment a yearold male with stage iv prostate cancer who experienced normalization of prostatespecific antigen psa levels after only two weeks of treatment with sm the compassionate access experience provides further evidence of the broadspectrum activity achieved with this approach as well as the activity across both solid and liquid tumor types in summary sm appears to be a safe and welltolerated therapeutic regimen that induced unexpected increases in survival in a variety of stage iv patients with many different tumor types along with rapid and profound improvements in performance status qualityoflife and pain outcome measures in all treated patients it is noteworthy that these responses occurred in salvage patients with fully disseminated stage iv tumors who had failed all prior therapies  many of whom were referred by memorialsloan kettering cancer center mskcc in new york city as no approved treatment options remained for these patients mechanism of action hypothesis tyme has a fundamentally different approach to thinking about the origins of cancer that in turn guides the approach taken to both better understand and treat the disease the insights developed by tyme are based on the wellestablished understanding that tumor cells have an altered metabolic profile compared to normal tissue cancer cells do not use the typical method of energy production to generate adenosine triphosphate atp from glucose in which  molecules of atp are produced from each glucose molecule oxidative phosphorylation and about  of the utilized oxygen gives rise to free radicals also known as reactive oxygen species ros rather cancer cells rely solely on glycolysis an inefficient process that only generates two molecules of atp from each glucose molecule and which gives rise to significantly higher levels of ros as a result cancer cells are continually takingup nutrients while simultaneously existing on the edge of free radical damage they require a very high level of nutrients to burn for energy and for biosynthesis of proteins lipids and nucleic acids due to their hyperproliferative state cancer cells have a preferred order to their diet starting with available glucose and in absence of sugars the cancer cell will switch to amino acids and ultimately lipids cancer cells hunger and aberrant energy metabolism create an opportunity to intervene in the tumor cell life cycle in a manner that kills cancer cells without damaging normal healthy tissue tyme accomplishes this by using combinations of approved drugs at lower doses than usual and with novel amino acid isomers that have never before been used in man tyme has developed a drug methodology that compromises the unique metabolic attributes of cancer cells that ultimately weakens the cancer leading to repeatable induced necrosis of the cancer cells in summary the first component of tymes proprietary regimen creates an artificial ketogenic state in the body the cancer cells respond to this signal of loss of available glucose as a food supply and the tumor cells in turn increase their uptake of amino acids cancer cells have a preference for certain amino acids and because the same agent potentiates a system in the cancer cell called lat transfer the cell can be compelled to less selectively consume nutrients during this induced starvation reaction tyme provides modified amino acids as part of the treatment regimen that the cell uses avidly but which are actually nonnutritive the effect is to impair protein synthesis thus resulting in an inability for the cancer cell to perform a variety of cellular functions a third component of the regimen stimulates the liver to produce increased cholesterol and related molecules these lipids are the source of much of the free radical generation in the body and with the increased uptake of cholesterol and lipids by cancer cells to support the hyperproliferative state they gain entry into the cell and can be exploited to generate an abundance of free radicals fourthly another catalytic molecule is contained in tymes sm product that increases the availability of electrons to be used in the generation of free radicals this has a number of effects which include free radical damage to the cell membrane itself making the cell leak its contents free radical damage to lipid rafts in the cell membrane which are scaffolds that anchor a variety of membrane receptors and signaling molecules that regulate cell function the stimulation of high levels of free radicals in the mitochondria where atp is produced and which are sensitive to free radical damage polar lipids produce more free radicals than the mitochondria can neutralize and the resultant damage to the mitochondria results in a catastrophic loss of energy production and rapid cell death cancer cells are thus killed in a process that has little effect on healthy tissue and with natural agents as the inducers of necrosis these agents are able to cross the bloodbrain barrier bbb and other difficulttoaccess boundaryprotected organs and tissue since three of the four components of the regimen are based on repurposed agents  drugs that have been approved and marketed for many years to treat noncancerrelated conditions  and since these agents are deployed in the context of sm at dosages far below the levels that they are marketed and used at currently there are unlikely to be safety issues associated with them in the current cancer treatment context the fourth component of sm is a modified version of an existing naturally occurring amino acid the only modification made involves rendering this version nonnutritive given these considerations it appears reasonable to assume that sm can be advanced through clinical development and regulatory review without the safety considerations attendant upon de novo compounds the multifactorial nature of sm and the fact that it targets the principles underlying cancer itself  regardless of the cell type or tissue of origin  should enable this therapy to provide benefit across multiple forms of cancer including both solid and liquid tumors and evade resistance conclusion in the phase  clinical trial  of the  patients had metastatic breast cancer thus tyme has elected to initially focus on this cohort of patients for the phase  trial the company is currently in the process of finalizing an investigational new drug ind application for submission to the nda the trial will likely be a multicenter study involving  stage iv breast cancer patients who have failed multiple prior chemotherapeutictargeted treatments the ind is scheduled to be filed during the summer of  with the phase  trial initiating in the third quarter of  according to the american cancer society there were approximately  cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed among women in  it is estimated that between  of those cases are stage iv at the time of diagnosis and of the cases that are diagnosed as stages iiii approximately  will have recurrence with metastases metastatic breast cancer network this represents an initial target population of approximately  patients substantial growth potential one of the most important findings from the phase  study was the fact that sm appeared to have activity against a wide range of cancers regardless of the tissue or organ of origin this means that tyme could generate significant peak sales with sm given the drugs possible deployment in both solid and liquid tumor types while most oncology drugs are being targeted towards smaller and smaller patient populations usually with the aid of diagnostic biomarkers that are designed to predict responsiveness the tyme approach appears to be universal to all forms of cancer irrespective of the tissue of origin or immune status it exploits the aberrant metabolic characteristics that differentiate all cancer cells  regardless of tissue type or organ of origin  from normal tissue in addition to the wide potential applicability sm has already demonstrated a more favorable safety profile vs avastin® and similar targeted therapeutics since it is based on existing approved agents being administered at low doses there does not seem to be a significant likelihood of greater toxicity being revealed in future clinical trials several of the worlds topselling drugs are anticancer agents eg avastin® bevacizumab sales of avastin® are projected to exceed  billion by  herceptin® trastuzumab is a breast cancer drug specifically for patients that harbor overexpression of the cell surface receptor her which occurs in approximately  of breast cancers bange et al  even with the limited patient population herceptin® still generated approximately  billion in revenue in  herceptin® was originally approved in part based on data showing that it increased overall survival in her overexpressing metastatic breast cancer patients who had received no prior treatment for metastatic disease from  months to  months herceptin prescribing information another study involving patients with her overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that had relapsed following one or more prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease reported an orr of  with a  cr rate and a  pr rate the results from the phase  trial of sm far exceeded results seen with herceptin® thus replication of those results in a larger patient cohort could potentially drive sm to be not just a treatment for latestage metastatic cancer patients but a frontline therapy for early stage patients this scenario could make sm a potential blockbuster drug while not even factoring in additional indications valuation methodology we have chosen to conservatively model potential sales of sm solely in latestage metastatic breast cancer patients however based on what appears to be a broad applicability across multiple tumor types this analysis may ultimately be too restrictive if the results seen in the phase  trial are replicated in a larger clinical trial the possibility of broader applicability into other types of cancer  eg renal cell carcinoma ewings sarcoma lymphomas and leukemias  could represent sources of upside to our estimates no revenue from an expanded access program is assumed which may be conservative  companies like pharmion and celgene generated tens of millions of dollars from such programs prior to the actual formal approval of several of their anticancer drugs we are estimating pricing of sm in relation to the per cycle cost of tykerb® lapatinib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed and commercialized by glaxosmithkline that is currently deployed as secondline therapy in metastatic breast cancer tykerb® is priced at roughly  per day cycle we estimate sm will cost  per cycle in the us and  per cycle in the eu in addition we are projecting a median seven cycles of therapy to be administered per patient the combination of tykerb® and xeloda® capecitabine another broadlyutilized chemotherapy drug carries a percycle cost of nearly  thus our pricing appears to be inline with other widely used agents however given the relatively low survival benefit typically associated with tykerb® in latestage patients  not to mention its side effect profile  there may be the possibility for higher per cycle pricing particularly in light of the pharmacoeconomic benefit argument that may be made for an agent that both provides substantial survival benefits as well as enhancement of patient wellbeing thus reducing reliance on supportive care painkillers and other cost drivers we model for tyme to initiate a phase  trial in late  a phase  trial in  with an nda filing in  and approval in the us in  with approval in the eu coming in  it should be noted that exceptional results like those seen in the phase  trial in a larger group of patients could warrant expedited approval of sm after the phase  trial is completed under the fdas accelerated approval program perhaps through evidence of tumor shrinkage in patients while this is certainly a possibility we choose to conservatively estimate that sm will go through the normal approval process and all three phases of clinical testing given a  discount rate a  chance of approval peak revenues in the us and eu of approximately  and  billion respectively with a  royalty generated through a partnership on sales in the eu we arrive at a net present value for sm in metastatic breast cancer of approximately  billion we add in the companys current cash total  million and an estimated  million in capital requirements to arrive at a present value of approximately  billion the company currently has  million shares outstanding thus equating to a fair value for the stock of approximately  and we are assigning a buy rating to the shares disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks
