jun   the intrigue of who shot jr ewing that captivated an entire nation in the early s has been resurrected here in federal court the jr ewing in this truelife drama is donald levine a prominent chicago and arizona real estate developer whose sometimes treacherous business deals vile temper and obsession for money earned the wrath of a host of business partners friends family and perhaps even the mafia the multimillionaire who made his home in munster and phoenix ariz even swindled his own father out of money so much money that his father at his retirement had to begin rebuilding his wealth according to testimony donalds brother robert levine  of the phoenix area has been on trial for the past two weeks for allegedly ordering the murders of donald  his wife marsha  and their only child mark then  donald and marsha were brutally murdered in their munster home nov   mark was struck over the head with the butt of a gun and escaped with a fractured skull robert faces federal charges in us district court in hammond for allegedly hiring a killer to bump off his brothers family worth about  million himself robert allegedly faced financial ruin because donald was reportedly about to cut robert out of the familys real estate business the defense argues that the death of donald the financier of the deals between the two brothers brought about roberts financial demise robert and his wife patricia steward filed for chapter  bankruptcy after donalds death murder anger greed revenge assistant us attorney ronald kurpiers said in his melodramatic opening remarks to the jury put them together and theyre the reason were sitting in the court room the defense doesnt argue that the motive in the killings was not money  it just differs in who wanted the levines estimated  million fortune much of which came from a trust left to marsha by her family defense lawyer kevin milner has argued that the man who hired the killer was the couples son mark who escaped with an owie  milner has not missed an opportunity to point out marks strange behavior  why did he run first to the basement and not his mother who was bleeding to death in the china room of the home or his father who was moaning and rolling back and forth from the pain of two bullets why did mark take time to call his girlfriend in chicago after calling police from a pay phone at a school across the street from the home while the gunman was still in the house mark apparently passed his two dying parents while walking to the master bedroom to make another call after the murders and as he was being carried out on the stretcher he again had the phone in his hand the only thing he doesnt do is stop and order a pizza milner said sarcastically during opening statements to the jury mark is expected to be among the  witnesses who testify at the trial that could extend well beyond the threeweek schedule another family member to take the stand will be william levine another brother of donald who the defense has tried to imply might have also wanted to kill him the defense pried out of hired killer bruce mckinney the details of a sexual relationship william had with bruce and williams exwife linda mckinney denied that donald knew of the relationship or might have been upset about it on the day before the murders marsha and donald were extremely upset testified fellow employees of the levines chicago business commercial retail specialists inc donald was unusually upset incommunicative very curt said stanley epstein a broker of the chicago business he just wasnt himself donald and marsha had a reason to be happy that day  their son a graduate of yale law school who has been described as their crown prince was to return home so he could attend his swearing in ceremony as an illinois lawyer the following day  the day of the murders at the time of the murders donald and marsha were selling off their chicago real estate business largely comprised of shopping centers they had bought a  home in phoenix and were preparing to move in addition to the real estate business donald had invested  million reportedly all of his liquidity in a montana gold mine which was giving him problems because the residents had opposed the mining the move to arizona followed what has been described as a terrible nuclear war of a fight that erupted in may  between robert and donald donald accused robert and patricia of embezzling a third of a million dollars and had threatened to put them in jail it apparently bothered him more that it was his brother who allegedly did this to him than the amount of the money witnesses said the amount of the money involved and the extent of the criminal activity varied greatly among the witnesses the dispute actually could have been a  accounting mistake although the boiling dispute eventually simmered the negotiated settlement left bitter feelings and proved costly to robert and patricias arizona real estate company which was forced to give up management services it provided for three shopping centers held by a partnership involving donald and robert the dispute only elevated tensions between the two families  donald and marsha despised patricia the new company formed to manage the development of three shopping malls after the dispute only included donald and robert marsha was less forgiving and told her husband that if he died first she would make sure robert was run out of the business because i dont deal with thieves throughout the trial robert has sat almost emotionless though attentive he entered the courtroom every day carrying a large file and pencils and as the proceedings started he took out a white legal pad that he uses for note taking the father of four has had two years of training in law and has participated actively in his case roberts wife patricia has missed only a couple hours of the testimony and she like her husband carries a note pad on one occasion she actually interrupted testimony to pass a message to her husbands lawyer although the two reportedly had marital problems some of which may have been caused by donald and marshas intense hatred for patricia the couple have supported each other as their private lives are exposed in the courtroom the drama of the trial has come from not only the witness stand but also from the government and the defense lawyer who unabashedly take their digs at every opportunity kurpiers and milner rarely have agreed on anything including what time the court should recess the trial has progressed slowly as testimony is frequently interrupted so the lawyers and the judge can argue over what the jury should or should not hear for the lawyers there has been a lot to argue  hearsay evidence from a dead woman the admission of a polygraph test from mark and the governments smoking gun a jailhouse confession the trial recessed for a day last week to give the defense time to regroup and prepare for the potentially damaging testimony of john gary rinaldo an inmate who was being held at a california detention center while awaiting charges on money laundering and bank fraud rinaldo testified outside of the ears of the jury that while incarcerated with robert he had more than  conversations with robert about the murders the defense is now trying to round up prisoners and prison officials who can testify that rinaldo accepted money for legal work while in jail and was not the jailhouse buddy the government represented to the court milner wants to prevent the testimony from being heard by the jury arguing that what robert told rinaldo is protected by attorneyclient privilege over the objections from the government us district court judge rudy lozano delayed the testimony of rinaldo though he ruled it could be allowed the defense which was caught off guard is hoping to change that ruling neither robert nor milner recognized rinaldos name on the governments witness list because the inmate apparently used a different name in jail the star witness in the case is the gunman himself  bruce mckinney an unemployed real estate agent who bragged often of his days in vietnam and his involvement with the elite special forces of the us army the father of two served in the army but never went to vietnam nor served in the special forces he admitted he told war stories when there were none to tell the one war story mckinney hopes the jury believes is that robert had promised to make him a millionaire if he would kill donald marsha and mark and that if he didnt mckinneys family would be harmed sitting behind bars since his arrest dec   mckinney broke eight months of silence and denial with a confession and a deal that could spare him a date with the electric chair mckinney has testified that robert ordered him to kill donald and subsequently added marsha and mark to the list to ensure himself a slice of the inheritance mckinney detailed his misfortunes  a heart attack that drained his finances and cost him his business and home a conviction for possession of marijuana and his difficulties in paying rent utility bills and feeding his family around the time of the murders the largeframed man with a thick black beard wore a power blue short coat that softened his imposing stature he was polite answering yes sir or no sir and sprinkling his remarks with a touch of humor  he described robert for the jury as the one wearing the toupee to support his wife and two daughters mckinney was carving totem poles and wooden bears in rawhide ariz a western theme town he harbored dreams of reentering the real estate business when he met robert and patricia in  he previously worked for their business elles corp and asked robert if he could again hang his real estate license at the office mckinney first met robert and patricia through william a longtime friend of mckinney and the godfather to one of his two daughters the confessed murderer had attended robert and patricias wedding which he described as a costume ball at their house robert gave mckinney an office though not a job in the summer of  a few months later mckinney believed robert and donald were considering giving him a job in their new company that is when robert allegedly began to bear his soul to mckinney about the problems between the two brothers mckinney said robert came to him one day and said he had obtained permission to kill donald and that we wanted you to do it the permission mckinney said he believed came from the mafia because he had often heard william talk about his familys ties to the mob in the end mckinney said he had changed his mind about the killings and even considered going to donald and began to leave a trail of clues however as the defense pointed out mckinney failed to take various opportunities to contact donald about the alleged scheme angry  sad  funny  wow  love  promotion email alerts stay uptodate by receiving news and special deals via
