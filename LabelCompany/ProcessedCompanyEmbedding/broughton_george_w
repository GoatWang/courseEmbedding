sics  fluid milk  ice cream  frozen desserts  dairy products stores  oil  gas exploration services company perspectives broughton foods company has been an innovative company guided by traditional wisdom from its beginnings the company has grown steadily to become a respected foods producer of premium quality products the broughton emphasis has always been on quality technology research and development the exclusive use of superior quality milk and ingredients and unparalleled service have given broughton a reputation for excellence company history broughton foods co is a regional dairy that distributes its fluid milk ice cream and other dairy products throughout the eastern united states the company has operations in ohio and west virginia led by members of the broughton family for its first half century the public yet closely held firm only nonvoting stock is sold publicly was guided by chief executive officer rod m collier in the mids members of the founding family continued to play important roles in the daytoday operation of the company with carl l broughton acting as chairman of the executive and finance committees john r broughton serving as treasurer and assistant secretary george w broughton in the role of executive vicepresident of sales and marketing and david j broughton acting as financial analyst neither a member of a dairy cooperative nor an affiliate of a larger food conglomerate broughton foods is rather unique in the fragmented competitive dairy industry though it is a relatively small player on the national scene the business has been characterized as a sizable force in the dairy industry the company worked diligently in the late s and early s to maintain its independent status in the face of dairy industry consolidation relying especially on product diversification by the mids its product line included fluid milk ice cream frozen yogurt ice cream novelties fruit juices and cottage cheese among other foods beverages and condiments the company even had three soda fountainstyle restaurants serving broughtons brand ice cream early th century origins the history of broughton foods co can be traced to  when john h broughton started selling the yield of his fathers marietta ohio dairy farm the broughtons delivered their milk butter and vegetables to customers via horsedrawn wagon and sold the farm produce in a familyowned grocery store they began expanding their dairy business from its headquarters in southeastern ohio on the ohio river in earnest in  purchasing a second farm building their first fullfledged dairy including an early universal milking machine and acquiring a dairy delivery truck eldest son gerald joined the growing business in  following his graduation from ohio state university with a degree in dairy technology a second son carl took a more circuitous route to the family farm after a twoyear stint at ohio state university he dropped out of that schools business administration program to move to california when the great depression shrunk job opportunities out west carl was compelled to return home to the family business where he too would make his career in  broughton patriarch john h was killed in an accident involving a newly installed icemaking machine his sons reorganized and incorporated their company as broughtons farm dairy with carl as president and youngest sibling robert who would graduate from marietta college in  as secretarytreasurer broughtons chalked up  in sales during its first year the interwar period brought a period of expansion especially in the retail end of the business gerald broughton who continued with the family company has been credited with launching the ice cream business in  broughtons opened a restaurant that same year featuring the companys namesake ice cream six more storerestaurants located throughout southeastern ohio and northern west virginia followed over the course of the next seven years broughtons promoted itself as the brightest star in the milky way during its early years world war ii labor shortage brings contraction a dearth of employees during world war ii even president carl broughton was called to duty from  to  forced the closure of all but one of broughtons retail stores the company used a strategy of acquisition to bounce back in the postwar era acquiring dairies in ohio west virginia and kentucky having forged a strong position in the business broughton began to diversify within the dairy industry via the  creation of the broughton foods division with primary operations in parkersburg west virginia this business segment produced portioncontrolled dairy and nondairy coffee creamers these aseptically packaged products were sold to supermarkets fast food restaurants and dining facilities in hotels relocated to charleston west virginia by the early s broughtons food division had added table cream nondairy whipped topping whipping cream egg nog dips and dairy and nondairy sour cream to its roster of products meanwhile the companys dairy division was also growing to produce cottage cheese yogurt ice cream ice milk and frozen novelties as well as a full line of fluid milk by  food products contributed more than  percent of broughtons more than  million in annual sales the companys diversification included a year foray into college and university dining halls in  it also created browell a small oil and gas drilling subsidiary over the decades broughtons need for fresh whole milk began to exceed its own dairys production capacity as a result the company cultivated longstanding relationships with many other independent dairy farmers eventually forging a network of more than  exclusive suppliers when carl broughton retired in  broughtons board of directors elected executive vicepresident samuel r cook to succeed him cook would serve in that capacity for more than  years when he was succeeded by president rod m collier technological changes revolutionize dairy business the perishability of milk and its derivatives has always been a challenge to dairymen as late as  a lack of refrigeration compelled broughton to deliver its milk to town twice each day to account for spoilage the impact of this factor has been mitigated over the course of the th century via improvements in processing storage and delivery processing advances have concentrated primarily on lengthening shelf life through the elimination of bacteria the most common method pasteurization heats milk to about °f °c to destroy microorganisms thereby extending the shelf life to  to  days under refrigeration in the s many dairies began implementing ultrahigh temperature pasteurization uht which steamheats milk up to °f °c or higher lengthening shelf life to months instead of weeks broughton became the first us dairy to adopt uperization a european variation on uht according to company literature this technology which places the product on a spiral flow for more uniform heating is  percent effective against contamination without affecting product taste by the early s broughton was uperizing  gallons of product per hour the company applied uht to the production of half and half whipping cream and ice cream and frozen yogurt mixes for food service the process gave these products a shelf life six to nine times longer than conventional methods thereby allowing for broader distribution broughton also adopted aseptic packaging processes to lengthen the shelf life of some of its products originally developed in europe after world war ii aseptic packaging unites the product with the packing process in a totally sterile environment most familiar to americans is the aseptic drink box broughton applied aseptic packaging principles to its production of table cream whipping cream half and half and related foods most often portioncontrolled for institutional food service in addition to their longer shelf lives aseptically packaged products do not require refrigeration until the packages seal is broken these hightech processes have helped make the company one of the nations leading producers of half and half with millions of coffee creamers made each month broughtons modes of delivery have also come a long way since the s when its unrefrigerated model t truck limited delivery to nearby marietta efficient transportation is a key factor in the perishability equation every hour that raw milk spends en route from any of broughtons more than  supplier dairies for example is an hour subtracted from the processes that extend its shelf life over the years the company accumulated its own fleet of refrigerated tank trucks for transport of raw milk and refrigerated tractortrailers for delivery of finished product by the late s and early s broughton boasted specialized dualtemperature vehicles that allowed the delivery of frozen and refrigerated products in the same shipment but as fleet management issues became increasingly complex in the early s broughton abandoned its companyowned vehicles in favor of a fullservice lease arrangement this change reduced the companys annual transportation costs by more than  high competition brings reduced returns in the early s broughtons quest for efficiency was a necessity of doing business in the highly competitive environment of the s with multibillion dollar giants like kraft foods dean foods co borden inc and conagra inc topping the industry broughton executives realized that their work was cut out for them in  the international dairy foods association forecast that rapid industry consolidation would reduce the number of fluid milk processing plants by  percent to less than  by the turn of the st century although generally regarded as a weakness broughton perceived particular strengths in its comparatively small size in  executive vicepresident and director of marketing george broughton told dairy foods jeff reiter we hold our own well because we are more flexible than larger competitors better able to react quickly to changes in the market and have a better rapport with customers in addition to its focus on costeffectiveness broughton concentrated on new product introductions in the late s and early s in a  profile for dairy foods magazine george broughton called new product development critical noting right now there are a lot of mergers going on in the industry and we need to either grow or die broughton launched nine new product lines in  alone many of them focused on the growing healthy segment of the industry consumer demand for foods with reduced fat calories sugar lactose and cholesterol provided many opportunities for new versions of traditional products these were distributed by broughton to private labelers as well as under the company name to broaden its lines beyond dairy especially into fruit juices broughton also distributed other companies goods under its trademark the company grew and retained its independent status in the early s but although sales increased  percent from  million in  to  million in  its net income declined  percent from  to  during that same period and as the company cut prices to retain its customer base it slid into a  shortfall in  newly elected chief executive officer rod collier blamed fluctuating expenses overcapacity in particular market segments and regional competition for the loss but expressed his belief that the foods division still represents broughtons greatest opportunity for future growth and profits principal subsidiaries browell inc principal

they were all ankle deep in liquid spirits thus bringing to a halt druggist green’s bootlegging business in  when g butchart of the lompoc hotel began dealing in firewater he brandished a gun and verbally made it clear what he would do to any reformers who endeavored to interfere with his tradehowever on jan   at about  am the town was rocked by the explosion of one of four bombs that had been tossed into the hotel’s lobby when butchart found a bomb under his bed both he and his terrified wife decided to call it quits and the much subdued bootlegger gave up and left townthe lompoc record declared that the meeting “was one of the finest representative gatherings known to lompoc for a long time the enthusiasm for temperance and the deepset determination not to tolerate a saloon in our temperance colony was unmistakable”however it soon became apparent that a single bombing incident was not enough to suppress the liquor traffic when the record wrote “much as we hate to admit it there is no disguising the fact that there is a little whiskey saloon in our temperance colony” another bomb exploded in george walker’s saloon and his building was demolished again the record wrote that “we are not an advocate of this way of dealing with the nuisance and curse but candor compels us to add that we are shedding no tears over it”walker made a hasty exit from lompoc and peace reigned until march  when the citizens were called to a mass meeting handbills and posters that were frantically passed out proclaimed “the crisis is upon us”pledges to adhere to the colony’s prohibition of liquor were renewed and a group of ladies later talked to messrs drumm and davis about their wickedness in selling whiskey “and other poisonous drinks” in a bar and suggested that they mend their ways and abandon their tradewhen two men refused and warned that if any attempt were made to run them out of town they wouldn’t hesitate to shoot this was too much for the angry citizens who stormed the saloon with a long rope after they had tied it all the way around the building with a mighty heaveho they began to pull the building to the ground suddenly though a sympathizer appeared on the scene and cut the rope jw saunders a prominent member of the community pulled himself from the badly tangled mass of fellow temperance workers lying in the dust brandishing a club he entered the saloon threatening to kill anyone who again attempted to cut the rope fearing for their lives the patrons fled to the streetthe rope was spliced and with a final tug the enemies of the “demon liquor” hauled the saloon off its foundation and with whiskey spilling from the building they dragged it half a block down the street get tips on free stuff and fun ideas delivered weekly to your inbox sign up i

against jw saunders et althe defense based its entire case on the fact that the occasion on which the saloon was pulled over was not a riot but a town meeting and a notguilty verdict was quickly obtainedattempts to carry the case into the federal courts failed and the rope was cut up and sold as souvenirs for  each to pay for the defensewhen john quincy adams spooner braved the opposition by opening a saloon in  the citizens tried to get rid of him by having him sentenced to jail for six months for bathing in the santa ynez river without adequate swimming clothes however in spite of his short absence the saloon stayed open even though a mysterious fire threatened the saloon it was saved from destructionthen one midnight in october a loud explosion shook the town causing buildings to rock on their foundations although the bomb had hit the saloon much to the disappointment of the temperance people it bounced off before exploding and the building was hardly damagednot until lompoc was incorporated in  was the demon liquor finally driven out even at that though the city’s prohibition was not destined to staythe founders had been so adamant in wanting to maintain complete prohibition that they had it so specified in every deed however the provision was nullified by the fact that these documents did not specify to whom the property would revert in case of violation then came the time when every incoming stage brought liquor from the “wide open” neighboring towns of guadalupe and los alamos licensed saloons were at last admitted by vote of the community and lompoc’s
