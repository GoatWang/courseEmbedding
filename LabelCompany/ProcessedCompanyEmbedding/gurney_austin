demonstration of the mediglider go to wwwmediglidercom  executives with austinbased mediglider corp say they have a product that addresses the nations shortage of nurses an automated gurney that moves patients in and out of bed without any lifting were bringing st century technology to an ageold problem chief operating officer gary pankonien said the batteryoperated gurney which is steered with a joystick works like this it slides a firm padded board under a patient inflates like an air mattress then glides the patient on to the gurney the mediglider can handle patients up to  pounds and can make degree turns company officials say vicki pascasio a longtime health care worker and president of torch management services inc works with community hospitals she said a product like the mediglider is very much needed in the health care industry we already have a shortage of nurses and staff pascasio said if they hurt themselves lifting it will put them out of work the company which was started in  with an initial investment of  million has gone through five focus groups and several prototypes it is now marketing the gurney and is on the verge of increasing production were trying to stay close to home and get the recipe right company president ralph smucker said then well go nationwide hospitals and nursing homes can buy the gurneys at a cost of up to  per machine or mediglider will own the gurney and a customer will purchase special disposable sheets at an annual cost of  or so the company estimates the cost for each patient transfer at  or  per move smucker said mediglider would cut workers compensation costs and save on litigation costs arising from dropped patients he said there also are labor savings because one operator as opposed to a group of nurses can transport patients the company on braker lane in north austin has 7 employees and expects to more than double its staff as it adds marketing personnel it uses 7 vendors for parts and expects to contract with a manufacturer if mediglider reaches its goal of  units per month it could create  manufacturing jobs company officials say smucker said the company is negotiating with several venture capital firms for an additional investment of  million we think it will take us to positive cash flow and profits he said lcopelinstatesmancom 7 view comments  most read round rock georgetown cedar
