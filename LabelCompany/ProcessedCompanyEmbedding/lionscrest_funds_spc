lionscrest capital lionscrest capital home tail risk blog resources books contact disclosures spitznagel on the paradox of higher returns with lower risk black swans nassim taleb new york times april    what we call here a black swan and capitalize it is an event with the following three attributes first it is an outlier as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility second it carries an extreme impact third in spite of its outlier status human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact making it explainable and predictable  i stop and summarize the triplet rarity extreme impact and retrospective though not prospective predictability what is tail risk “tails” refer to the two ends of a probability distribution with “left tail” events describing the most negative outcomes — such as severe widespread market shocks which generate large losses— and “right tail” events describing the most positive market outcomes  “tail risk” refers to the prospect of lefttail events which is seen in the left tail of the probability distribution  tail events are rare though more common than would be reflected in a normal distribution gaussian bell curve  in fact it turns out tails are “fatter” that is more frequent than many people realize this first chart is a diagram of a normal probability distribution the horizontal xaxis shows the investment returns from the lowest on the left to the highest on the right and with the  mean return in the middle  the vertical yaxis show the number of observations of each return for instance the number of months that produce a  gain the number of months that produce a  loss and so on  in a normal distribution the largest number of observations centres around the mean and declines to the right and left giving it the bell shape as there are typically fewer observations of extreme returns   units of standard deviation ‘”sigma” noted by the symbol δ in the diagram provide a measurement of the expected frequency of the returns  in a normal distribution returns that are generated within one sigma of the mean are predicted to happen  roughly twothirds of the time  as noted above fat tails exist because extreme events are far more prevalent than is explained by the normal distribution source welton investment corporation these fat tails can be empirically verified see table on left using data going back  years  what is readily apparent from these analyses is that not only are tail events far more frequent than is generally believed and financial theory predicts but they are also far greater in magnitude and thus more consequential the  global financial collapse a crisis that was completely unexpected by most and had devastating consequences illuminated very powerfully the reality and seriousness of tail risk before the crisis few people were emphasizing the significance of tail risk for markets and investors and fewer still were as vocal as nassim taleb the premier specialist on rare events  taleb described these risks as “black swans” how often do black swans occur in finance these consequential black swan events happen more often than one might expect the  stock market crash the  us and japanese real estate collapse the  russian default and ltcm collapse the collapse of the  tech market bubble the collapse of the  real estate bubble the  stock market crash the  european and us debt crisis are all examples of crises that were “obvious” in hindsight but surprising nonetheless during their occurrence why is it important to manage tail risk the events of  are now widely understood to have been a black swan event  protecting against these catastrophic events is both necessary and possible   the series of charts above depict investment profiles with differing degrees of exposure to risks and returns a “black swan” profile describes a high risk of losing everything blowing up  think banking industry in   a “robust” profile means safety  think investment in cash  an “antrifragile” profile is one that benefits from increased volatility  think tailhedged portfolios how is protecting against ‘black swans’ different than managing volatility overall volatility returns within   standard deviation can often be reduced using traditional diversification techniques diversification by asset class geography industry cap size currency duration etc  black swans however behave differently the speed and severity of unexpected market declines – like the world witnessed in  – are exacerbated by the interconnectedness of global financial markets and economies  as a result correlations amongst asset classes can quickly rise to  often rendering these diversification techniques virtually uselessmost investors have had to rely on imprecise and often ineffective hedges  these types of defensive strategies in addition to the use of simple diversification are widely available and commonly used by investorsraising cashmoving into defensive stocksreducing market exposure through short exposure eg short sp etflong volatility eg vix etfsinvesting in some sort of defensive swap eg cds totalreturn swapsinvesting in goldthere are pros and cons associated with each of these strategies but none provides reliable defence against black swans  the protection benefit of the first three strategies results from a correct prediction of the market’s downward direction  if the prediction is incorrect however and the market moves up either losses mount due to the short exposure or the benefits of a rising market are missed cash and defensive stocks  a similar risk applies to being outright long volatility via vix etfs  these are market timing risks with respect to swaps there is a cost to bear for purchasing the protection  if the market rises gains are net of this cost  but in a true panic  as we experienced during the second part of   the counterparty to the swap may no longer be able to payout gains effectively wiping out the usefulness of the swap  this is not an insignificant risk one need only remember lehman and aig   gold although a very popular hedge is not at all effective as tail protection  typically in a crisis event investors are desperate to raise cash to cover their losses and margin calls and thus sell anything liquid and profitable  in  gold dropped by some  how does one protect against black swans there are few methods as effective as a dedicated options strategy particularly through the use of puts  however there are limitations to employing this strategy successfullylong option strategies where premiums are paid can be very expensive especially if maintained over an extended period of timethe unexpected nature of black swans requires that protection strategies never be allowed to lapse  an active “always on” option strategy requires effort diligence and expertiseoption market bidoffer pricing for deep outofthemoney otm puts is extremely wide typically about   being able to trade at favourable prices can mean the difference between being able to efficiently implement the strategy or being completely priced outtrue options expertise and experience is difficult to access all content   lionscrest capital ltd  images and content cannot be used or reproduced without express written permission please

capital home tail risk blog resources books contact disclosures the dao of capital austrian investing in a distorted world as todays preeminent doomsday investor mark spitznagel describes his daoist and roundabout investment approach “one gains by losing and loses by gaining”   this is austrian investing an archetypal counterintuitive and proven approach gleaned from the yearold austrian school of economics that is both timeless and exceedingly timely in the dao of capital hedge fund manager and tailhedging pioneer mark spitznagel—with one of the top returns on capital of the financial crisis as well as over a career—takes us on a gripping circuitous journey from the chicago trading pits over the coniferous boreal forests and canonical strategists from warring states china to napoleonic europe to burgeoning industrial america to the great economic thinkers of late th century austria we arrive at his central investment methodology of austrian investing where victory comes not from waging the immediate decisive battle but rather from the roundabout approach of seeking the intermediate positional advantage what he calls shi of aiming at the indirect means rather than directly at the ends the monumental challenge is in seeing time differently in a whole new intertemporal dimension one that is so contrary to our wiring spitznagel is the first to condense the theories of ludwig von mises and his austrian school of economics into a cohesive and—as spitznagel has shown—highly effective investment methodology from identifying the monetary distortions and nonrandomness of stock market routs spitznagels bread and butter to scorned highlyproductive assets in ron pauls words from the foreword spitznagel “brings austrian economics from the ivory tower to the investment portfolio”  the dao of capital provides a rare and accessible look through the lens of one of todays great investors to discover a profound harmony with the market process—a harmony that is so essential today further reading  the dao of capital website the financial times lexicon  austrian economicsa school of economic thought originating in austria in the late nineteenth century which focuses on the concept of opportunity cost  in economic theory the term austrian school stands for liberalism and laissezfaireeconomics where economic performance is optimised when there is limited government interferencethe austrian school of economics has its original roots in the work of carl menger from the university of vienna  references to the topic were first published in  wellknown followers of menger included eugen von böhmbawerk  –  ludwig von mises  –  and perhaps most important friedrich a hayek  – hayek for example strongly rejected any intervention by the state in the economy for him markets work perfectly in the sense that the market price balances supply and demand  a perfect market is one characterised by easy access to information no barriers to entry and with prices controlled by all participantsdue to the global financial crisis of  and  the popularity of the austrian school of economics has experienced a boost in recent times because it had predicted a long time ago that too much debt – due to too low interest rates – would trigger investment bubbles followed by a crisis after these bubbles burst  for example look at ireland’s property bubble which was fuelled by reckless lending by banks to property developersin contrast to keynesianism the austrian school of thought holds that the business cycle is driven by the supply side of the economy not demand if interest rates are too low we will have overinvestment this may lead to overproduction which may trigger a crisis during the crisis supply declines until it is once again equal to overall demand then a new cycle startsfor the austrian school the main challenge is not inflation but overinvestment in the face of too much money or toolow interest rates that can lead to a crisis  too much money means that the growth of money supply is much higher than the growth of goods and services in an economy this leads to inflation which is an increase in the average prices of all goods because there is more money availablethis means that the right level of the interest rate called the ‘natural rate of interest’ is crucial to prevent a crisis this type of interest rate attracts enough investment to ensure full employment and no inflation if the actual rate is equal to the natural rate there is no inflationfurther reading  ludwig von mises institute  austrian school

world in which we live has an increasing number of feedback loops causing events to be the cause of more events say people buy a book because other people bought it thus generating snowballs and arbitrary and unpredictable planetwide winnertakeall effects”– nassim nicholas taleb the black swan by john mauldinmauldin economicsjuly  “what do you do” is a common question americans ask people they have just met some people outside the us consider this rude – as if our jobs define who we are not true of course but we still feel obliged to answer the questionmy work involves so many different things that it isn’t easy to describe my usual quick answer is that i’m a writer my readers might say instead “he tells people what could go wrong” i like to think of myself as an optimist and i do often write about my generally optimistic view of the future but that optimism doesn’t often extend to the performance of governments and central banks frankly we all face economic and financial risks and we all need to prepare for them knowing the risks is the first step toward preparingexactly  years ago we were months way from a worldshaking financial crisis by late  we had an inverted yield curve steep and persistent enough to be a highprobability indicator of recession  months later so in late  i was writing about the probability that we would have a recession in  i was also writing about the heavy leverage in the banking system the ridiculous level of highyield offerings the terms and potential turmoil in the bond and banking markets and the crisis brewing in the subprime market i wish i had had the money then that a few friends did to massively leverage a short position on the subprime market i estimated at that time that the losses would be  billion at a minimum whereupon a whole lot of readers and fellow analysts told me i was just way too bearishturned out the losses topped well over  trillion and triggered the financial crisis and great recession conditions in the financial markets needed only a spark from the subprime crisis to start a firestorm all over the world plenty of things were waiting to go wrong and it seemed like they all did at the same time governments and central bankers scrambled hard to quench the inferno looking back i wish they had done some things differently but in the heat of battle – a battle these particular people had never faced before with more going wrong every day – it was hard to be philosophically puresidebar i think the feds true mistakes were qe qe and missing their chance to start raising rates in  by then they had time to more carefully consider those decisionswe don’t have an inverted yield curve now so the only truly reliable predictor of recessions in the us is not sounding that warning but when the central bank artificially holds down shortterm rates it is difficult if not almost impossible for the yield curve to invertwe have effectively suppressed that warning signal but i am laser focused on factors that could readily trigger a global recession resulting in another global financial crisis all is not well in the markets yes we see stock benchmarks pushing to new highs and bond yields at record lows inflation benchmarks are stable unemployment is low and going lower gdp growth is slow but it’s still growth all that says we shouldn’t worry perversely the signs that we shouldn’t worry are also reasons why we shouldthis is a classic minsky teaching moment stability breeds instabilityi know the bullish arguments for why we can’t have another crisis banks are better capitalized now regulators are watching more intently bondholders are on notice not to expect more bailouts all that’s trueon the other hand today’s global megabanks are much larger than their  versions were and they are more interconnected most americans – the  i’ve called the unprotected – are still licking their wounds from the last battle many are in worse shape now than in  our crisisfighting reserves are loweuropean banks are still highly leveraged the shadow banking system in china has grown to scary proportionsglobalization has proceeded apace since  and the world is even more interconnected now problems in faraway markets can quickly become problems close to home and that’s without a global trade wari am concerned that another major crisis will ensue by the end of  – though it is possible that a salutary combination of events aided by complacency could let us muddle through for another few years but there is another recession in our future there is always another recession and it’s going to be at least as bad as the last one was in terms of the global pain it causes the recovery is going to take much longer than the current one has because our massive debt buildup is a huge drag on growth i hope i’m wrong but i would rather write these words now and risk eating them in my  yearend letter than leave you unwarned and unpreparedbecause i’m traveling this week this letter will be just a few appetizers –black swan hot wings black swan meatballs in orange sauce teriyaki swan skewers and the like – to whet your appetite and help you anticipate what’s comingseriously speaking could the three scenarios we discuss below turn out be fateful black swans yes but remember this a harmless white swan can look black in the right lighting conditions sometimes that’s all it takes to start a panicblack swan  yellen overshootsit is increasingly evident at least to me that the us economy is not taking off like the rocket some predicted after the election president trump and the republicans haven’t been able to pass any of the fiscal stimulus measures we hoped to see banks and energy companies are getting some regulatory relief and that helps but it’s a far cry from the sweeping healthcare reform tax cuts and infrastructure spending we were promised though serious major tax reform could postpone a us recession to well beyond  what we are going to get instead is tinkering around the edgeson the bright side unemployment has fallen further and discouraged workers are reentering the labor force but consumer spending is still weak so people may be less confident than the sentiment surveys suggest inflation has perked up in certain segments like healthcare and housing but otherwise it’s still low to nonexistentis this by any stretch of the imagination the kind of economy in which the federal reserve should be tightening monetary policy no – yet the fed is doing so  partly because they waited too long to end qe and to begin reducing their balance sheet fomc members know they are behind the curve and they want to pay lip service to doing something before their terms end moreover janet yellen stanley fischer and the other fomc members are religiously devoted to the phillips curve that theory says unemployment this low will create wageinflation pressure that no one can see this pressure mounting seems not to matter it exists in theory and therefore must be counteredthe attitude among central bankers who are basically all keynesians is that messy reality should not impinge on elegant theory you just have to glance at the math to recognize the brilliance of the phillips curveit was winston churchill who said “however beautiful the strategy you should occasionally look at the results” fact is the lack of wage growth among the bottom – of workers the unprotected class constitutes a real weaknesses in the us economy if you are a service worker competition for your job has kept wages downthe blackswan risk here is that the fed will tighten too much too soon we know from recent fomc minutes that some members have turned hawkish in part because they wanted to offset expected fiscal stimulus from the incoming administration that stimulus has not been forthcoming but the fomc is still acting as if it will bewhat happens when the fed raises interest rates in the early uncertain stages of a recession instead of lowering them i’m not sure we have any historical examples to review logic suggests the fed will extinguish any inflation pressure that exists and push the economy in the opposite direction instead into outright deflationdeflation in an economy as debtburdened as ours is could be catastrophic we would have to repay debt with cash that is gaining purchasing power instead of losing it to inflation americans have not seen this happen since the s it wasn’t fun then and it would be even less fun nowworse i doubt trump’s fomc appointees will make a difference trump appears to be far more interested in reducing the fed’s regulatory role than he is in tweaking its monetary policies i have no confidence that yellen’s successor whoever that turns out to be will know what needs to be done or be able to do it fast enoughlet me make an uncomfortable prediction i think the trump fed – and since trump will appoint at least six members of the fomc in the coming year it will be his fed – will take us back down the path of massive quantitative easing and perhaps even to negative rates if we enter a recession the urge to “do something” or at least be seen as trying to do something is just going to be too strongblack swan  ecb runs out of bulletslast week news reports said that the greek government is preparing to issue new bonds for the first time in three years “issue bonds” is a polite way of saying “borrow more money” something many bond investors think greece is not yet ready to dotheir opinions matter less than ecb chief mario draghi’s draghi is working hard to buy every kind of european paper except that of greece adding greece to the ecb bond purchases program would certainly helprelative to the size of the eurozone economy draghi’s stimulus has been far more aggressive then the fed’s qe it has pushed both deeper with negative interest rates and wider by including corporate bonds if you are a major corporation in the eurozone and the ecb hasn’t loaned you any money or bought your bonds yet just wait small businesses on the other hand are being starvedsuch interventions rarely end well but admittedly this one is faring better than most europe’s economy is recovering at least on the surface as the various populist movements and bank crises fade from view but are these threats gone or just glossed over the brexit negotiations could also throw a wrench in the worksdespite recent predictions by ecb watchers and the euro’s huge move up against the dollar on friday anatole kaletsky at gavekal thinks draghi is still far from reversing course he expects that the first tightening steps won’t happen until  and anticipates continued bond buying at a slower pace and nearzero rates for a long time after but he also sees risk anatole explained in a recent reportfirstly fed tapering occurred at a time when europe and japan were gearing up to expand monetary stimulus but when the ecb tapers there won’t be another major central bank preparing a massive balance sheet expansion it could still turn out therefore that the postcrisis recovery in economic activity and the appreciation of asset values was dependent on everlarger doses of global monetary stimulus if so the prophets of doom were only wrong in that they overstated the importance of the fed’s balance sheet compared with the balance sheets of the ecb and bank of japanthis is a genuine risk and an analytical prediction about the future on which reasonable people can differ unlike the factual observations above regarding the revealed behavior of the ecb the francogerman rapprochement and the historical experience of fed taperingsecondly it is likely that the euro will rise further against the us dollar if the ecb begins to taper and exits negative interest rates a stronger euro will at some point become an obstacle to further gains in european equity indexes which are dominated by export stocksanatole makes an important point the us’s tapering and now tightening coincided with the ecb’s and boj’s both opening their spigots that meant worldwide liquidity was still ample i don’t see the fed returning that favor draghi and later kuroda will have to normalize without a fed backstop – and that may not work so wellblack swan  chinese debt meltdownchina is by all appearances unstoppable gdp growth has slowed down to  according to official numbers the numbers are likely inflated but the boom is still underway reasonable estimates from knowledgeable observers still have china growing at – which given china’s size is rather remarkable the problem lies in the debt fueling the growthambrose evanspritchard reported some shocking numbers in his july  telegraph column a report from the people’s bank of china showed offbalancesheet lending far higher than previously thought and accelerating quickly interestingly the chinese have made all of this quite public and president xi has taken control of publicizing itthe huge increase last year probably reflects efforts to jumpstart growth following the  downturn banks poured fuel on the fire because letting it go out would have been even worse but they can’t stoke that blaze indefinitelypresident xi jinping has been trying to dial back credit growth in the stateowned banks for some time but in the shadow banks that xi doesn’t control credit is growing at an astoundingly high rate far offsetting any minor cutbacks that xi has madehere are a few more juicy quotes from ambrosepresident xi jinping called for a hardheaded campaign to curb systemic risk and to flush out “zombie companies” warning over the weekend that financial stability was a matter of urgent national securityit is the first time that a chinese leader has chaired the national finance work conference – held every five years to thrash out longterm plans – and is a sign of rising concern as debt reaches pc of gdpin a move that will send shivers up the spines of local party officials he said they will be held accountable for the rest of their lives for debts that go wrong any failure to identify and tackle risks will be deemed “malfeasance”ambrose then quotes patrick chovanec of silvercrest asset management“the banks have been selling products saying it isn’t our risk investors have been buying them saying it’s not our risk either they all think the government will save everything so what the markets are pricing is what they think is political risk not economic risk” he saida market in which “they all think the government will save everything” is generally not one you want to own – but china has been an exception it won’t remain one forever the collapse when it comes could be earthshakingchinese growth has been fueled by a near doubling of both gdp and debt over the last nine yearsone reason why so many people are complacent about china is that they truly believe that “this time is different” applies to chinese debt maybe in  years i will look back and say that it really was different but i don’t think so as is often the case with china china’s current circumstances are without a true equal in the history of the worldand if xi is really serious about slowing the pace of growth another form of tightening by a major world economy that move would just add to overall global riskit is very possible that any of these black swans could trigger a recession in the us and let’s be clear the next us recession will be part of a major global recession and will result in massive new government debt buildup it will not end well elerian  the upside and downside of liquiditydriven markets    by mohamed a elerian july bloomberg viewover the past few months government bond yields have fallen the dollar has weakened and financials have underperformed yet the major stock indexes are at or very near record highs as persistently supportive liquidity conditions have more than compensated for policy and growth disappointments by boosting returns and repressing volatility ample liquidity is a gift for investors it makes the investment journey pleasing comfortable and lengthy but it is not a destinationwith the exception of buoyant stock market indexes it is hard to find many financial markets that have managed to retain their postus election mood specifically after climbing to  percent the yield on year treasuries has fallen to below  percentthe yield differential between us treasuries and german bunds has narrowed from more than  basis points to just  basis pointsthe widely followed dxy dollar index which reached a high of  on dec  has depreciated sharply to  a level not seen since august of last yearthe mexican peso has appreciated to its strongest level in a year after falling sharply on fears of us protectionismmuch of this reflects the process of markets repricing to lower expectations for us growth and for federal reserve policy tightening compared to the rest of the world and especially relative to europe and the european central bank the main reason for this is reduced hopes for a rapid economic policy breakthrough powered by the implementation of tax reform and infrastructure programsdespite republican majorities in both chambers congress has struggled to come together on major legislation most visibly health care an issue that dominated the party’s narrative during the campaign this has delayed progrowth economic bills while making their prospects more uncertain with fed monetary measures already stretched there has been little policy offset to a soft patch in indicators of household and corporate economic activityyet none of this seems to have been reflected in the major stock indexes all three  the dow jones nasdaq and sp  registered more record highs this week in the process the leadership of the market has returned to tech and other disruptors after a brief but intense postelection romance with financials and industrials deemed to be the largest beneficiary of trumponomicsthe markets’ overall sense of goldilocks  not too hot not too cold  explains much of the gap between buoyant stock indexes and lagging economic and policy fundamentalsgrowth may be low but the markets perceive it as relatively stable the trump administration has not followed through on protectionist measures that would threaten a global trade war concerns about disruptive european politics to the extent they even registered in stock markets have been alleviated by president emmanuel macron’s victory in france  interest rates continue to be low throughout the advanced world with markets also marking down their expectations of fed tightening in the last few weeks two systemically important central banks the ecb and the bank of japan continue to provide a lot of liquidity and on a predictable monthly schedule and as signaled on thursday by ecb president mario draghi they seem in no rush to taper despite the improvement in economic conditions moreover with corporate balance sheets flush with cash valuations are also influenced by understandable expectations of more dividends stock buybacks and mergers and acquisitionsliquidity especially when ample and predictable can fuel markets and condition investor behavior in a supportive manner for quite a while but when judged against the objective of durable longterm gains it is best seen as part of the investment journey the destination however doesnt depend on liquidity alone economic and corporate fundamentals play a much larger roleso far equity investors have experienced an unusually long and fulfilling journey  one that absent a major accident could last a little longer what remains more elusive however is confidence that this will end up at an enjoyable destinationbut the most reassuring factor for traders and investors remains very loose financial conditions spitznagel  the parttime critics of central banks    by mark spitznagelthe mises institute july there seems to be no shortage today of investors and pundits criticizing the market interventions of the world’s central banks monetary stimulus in the form of artificially low interest rates and bloated central bank balance sheets  trillion to be exact the argument goes have created another dangerous financial bubble evidenced by ubiquitously bubbly stock market valuation ratios that ultimately threatens the financial system yet again the author shares wholeheartedly in this criticismthe ethical problem is where were these voices when this all started with greenspan in the s and more specifically with bernanke in  the central bank critics today who were not critics of — and in most cases were even sympathetic to — the great bailouts and stimulus that started almost a decade ago have reserved their criticisms only for those interventions that appear to hurt their interests as opposed to those that have helped them after all no one would disagree that bailouts and monetary stimulus got us out of the last financial crisis but they also certainly got us to where we are today vulnerable to another even bigger onewe are so concerned about our friend the strungout junkie though we paid little mind when they were but a casual user it is so easy to care when problems become obvious and critical so hard when they are subtler and nascent artificial stimulus in an economy is the same it is easily ignored as a problem in its infancy but it always develops into a huge problem economies and markets are structurally altered and distorted by such stimulus such that it cannot be removed without breaking those new structures it must rather be ever increased though even this will only delay an inevitable collapseit is just too easy in today’s investing environment and even necessary for most participants to sympathize with and even exploit central bank interventions doing otherwise creates an opportunity cost in one’s career and investments but doing so puts one in the position of enabler to the economic system’s selfdestructive dependence on artificial stimulus one cannot be a parttime classical liberal criticizing central planning only when it runs contrary to one’s interests indeed this is the very problem of socialism there are winners and losers the winners are in the here and now — the seen the losers are in the future — the unseen the winners dont complain and the losers can‘t until it is too latebut as the future becomes the here and now the unseen becomes the seen those who now think they are anticipating a problem and its cause yet supported that same cause when they stood to benefit must be seen for what they are fellow travelers in the central planning ideology that grips today’s financial markets they are too late average investor allocation to equities is over     ira  fade the great rotation into europe    by r christopher whaleninstitutional risk analystjuly  news last week that european central bank chief mario draghi was considering an end to the ecb’s extraordinary purchases of securities quickly let some air out of the great rotation into eu stocks  sure the euro surged against a weakening dollar but europe’s mountain of bad debt remains unresolved  even after the election of emmanuel macron to the french presidency  yet hope springs eternal in some quarters after draghi’s claim of a successful “reflation”“all the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area” draghi told the ecb’s annual conference “deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones” the former head of the bank of italy declared draghi’s bull call on inflation provides optimism for relief on excessive levels of bad debt albeit in a context where the eu’s rules on resolving dead banks remain entirely subjectivethe july  approval of the latest statesupported rescue for banca monte dei paschi di siena montepaschi illustrates the deflationary challenges still facing europe  as part of the overhaul reuters reports montepaschi “will transfer  billion euros to a privately funded special vehicle on market terms with the operation partially funded by italian bank rescue fund atlante ii”  the bank will receive  billion euros in new public equity funds for its third bailout in a decadetwo weeks before the eu decision on rescuing montepaschi the italian government supported the sale of two profoundly insolvent italian banks  the assets of popolare di vicenza and veneto banca were sold to intesa sanpaolo group at an estimated cost to the government of  billion euros marking italy’s latest breech of the eu’s rules on state support for failing financial institutionslike montepaschi where retail investors were heavily subsidized the intesa sanpaolo transaction avoids imposing losses on senior debt and depositors but wipes out the equity and junior debt  this outcome reflects political as well as financial constraints in italy but shows how far there is to go in the process of resolving bad banks in europeof note italy is being given control over the remaining “bad bank” to wind down as the assets and deposits are conveyed to intesa sanpaolo  this permits a bailout of senior unsecured creditors  so italy gets what it wants – continued circumvention of eu bailout rules if a bank disappears notes a wellplaced eu observer “state aid rules do not applycompare the sale of these two insolvent italian banks with the resolution in early june of banco popular espanol which became the first eu bank to be resolved by the eu’s single resolution board srb  banco popular had a third of total assets in bad loans and real estate owned double the  average for all banks in spain  in the us by comparison nonperforming loans plus real estate owned equaled less than  of total assets for all banks at the end of q   “the resolution of banco popular under which it was acquired by banco santander sa is consistent with the eu’s bank resolution and recovery directive brrd” moody’s notes “which restricts the use of public funds to rescue failing banks the route followed by the eu authorities in the case of banco popular contrasts with the approach taken elsewhere to other ailing banks notably in the case of the troubled italian lender banca monte dei paschi di siena spa”the state bailout of montepaschi like the sale of the two smaller banks to intesa sanpaolo reflects political realities in italy “montepaschi’s liability structure includes large volumes of bonds purchased by retail investors before the bank resolution and recovery directive introduction” moody’s continues “retail investors also accounted for around  of banco popular’s share capital and also held an undisclosed share of the bank’s tier  instruments”welladvised institutional investors fled italian banks years ago partly because they could not trust official disclosure  so the rome government countenanced the sale of “deposits” to retail investors by montepaschi and other italian zombie banks  the process of selling the deposits and good assets of the two italian zombie banks to intesa sanpaolo while retaining the toxic waste in a “bad bank” represents the true cost of this latest example of moral hazard in europedraghi deserves considerable credit for the worsening situation at montepaschi starting with his tenure at the bank of italy  when the bank merged with antonveneta a troubled bank it bought from spain’s santander montepaschi’s troubles accelerated  italys thirdbiggest lender received a  billion euro state bailout in the negative political consequences for the current government in rome of the latest montepaschi bailout are still unfolding but draghi and his fellow technocrats are the true authors of this mess  more eu banks still face levels of bad debts that not only indicate insolvency but under the eu’s often ignored fiscal rules suggest a haircut for senior debt and depositors without state aidas with the eu today american officials in the late s and s bent the rules regarding bank disclosure to enable most of the larger internationally active us banks to avoid a painful debt restructuring  the latin debt crisis trouble in the oil patch and the sl debacle pushed some of america’s largest banks to the edge of bankruptcy starting a process of deregulation that is still little understood by investors and analyststhe federal reserve board under chairman paul volcker and other regulators allowed large banks to engage in offbalance sheet financial transactions that concealed tens of billions in loan exposures this loosening of prudential standards regarding the treatment of offbalance sheet securities deals eventually led to the  financial collapse three decades later when concealed structured investment vehicles came back to issuers like citigroup nysec the results were disastroustoday officials in europe led by ecb chief mario draghi are playing a similar game pretending that bad public and private debt on the books of eu banks and investment houses and held by individuals is somehow money good  as with the us in the s the stark reality inside the eu banking system is being concealed under a heavy dose of technocratic obfuscationmountains of public debt in europe also indicate proponents of the bullish eu equity trade may be a tad exuberant  europe just dodged a bullet in greece where a lastminute deal with the international monetary fund allowed the member nations to kick the can down the road until next year  with debt at  of gdp greece is crippled economically and requires debt reduction in order to attract new investment  over the past few months investors have driven yields on greek debt to the lowest level in years  to that point investor optimism on the eu is predicated on an eventual debt bailout for greece  yet investors wont see any details on a long awaited greek debt restructuring plan before the german elections later this year  the eu trade as it were depends an awful lot on what happens to angela merkel’s coalition this septembereconomic reality is slowly leading the eu down the road to the assumption of bad debt of weaker states by the stronger members of the federation led by germany eu economic commissioner pierre moscovici has called for “debt reduction” in greece a proposal that is met with a lukewarm response by germans  but will merkel ultimately go alongin the long run in a completely integrated euro zone we would talk about a ‘communitization’ of new debt but were not going to start with that moscovici told reporters last weekthe necessary condition for the bull case on the eu is that the germans must eventually embrace a federated structure for europe this as part of a gradual approach being advanced by leaders such as macron in france and moscovici in brusselsjoint and several responsibility for all eu debts is the cost of unity  such a scenario faces significant political and practical obstacles most notably in germany but also in france where macron must somehow convince his citizens to embrace german style economic behaviora gradualist plan for a european federation seems unworkable so long as member states are able to borrow against europe’s collective credit without toeing the line on fiscal reforms – as in the case of italy and its troubled banks“the euro crisis resulted from the fallacy that a monetary union would evolve into a political union” writes yanis varoufakis a former finance minister of greece  “today a new gradualist fallacy threatens europe the belief that a federationlite will evolve into a viable democratic federation” mauldin  the next minsky moment    by john mauldinmauldin economicsjune  the next minsky momenteconomics has its overused themes and phrases too one is “minsky moment” the point at which excess debt sparks a financial crisis the late hyman minsky said that such moments arise naturally when a long period of stability and complacency eventually leads to the buildup of excess debt and overleveraging at some point the branch breaks and gravity takes over it can happen quickly toominsky studied under schumpeter and was clearly influenced by many of the classical economists but he must be given credit for formalizing what were only suggestions or incomplete ideas and turning them into powerful economic themes i’ve often felt that minsky did not get the credit he deserved i look at some of the piddling ideas that earn nobel prizes in economics and compare them to the importance of minsky’s work and i get an inkling of the political nature of economics prizesminsky’s model of the credit system which he dubbed the “financial instability hypothesis” fih incorporated many ideas already circulated by john stuart mill alfred marshall knut wicksell and irving fisher “a fundamental characteristic of our economy” minsky wrote in  “is that the financial system swings between robustness and fragility and these swings are an integral part of the process that generates business cycles” wikipediaminsky came to mind because in the past week i saw yet more signs that financial markets are overvalued and investors excessively optimistic yet i still haven’t seen many references to minsky that’s a little surprisingon reflection i realized i hadn’t mentioned minsky lately either that is a potentially dangerous oversight because we forget his fundamental insights at our peril last week’s brief technology tumble should have been a wakeup call so today we’ll have a little minsky refresher and look at some recent danger signs and i predict that we will soon see minsky mentions popping up everywherenatural instabilityhyman minsky who passed away in  spent most of his academic career studying financial crises he wanted to know what caused them and what triggered them his research all led up to his financial instability hypothesis he thought crises had a lot to do with debt minsky wasn’t against all debt though he separated it into three categoriesthe safest kind of debt minsky called “hedge financing” for example a business borrows to increase production capacity and uses a reasonable part of its current cash flow to repay the interest and principal the debt is not riskfree but failures generally have only limited consequencesminsky’s second and riskier category is “speculative financing” the difference between speculative and hedge debt is that the holder of speculative debt uses current cash flow to pay interest but assumes it will be able to roll over the principal and repay it later sometimes that works out borrowers can play the game for years and finally repay speculative debt but it’s one of those arrangements that tends to work well until it doesn’tit’s the third kind of debt that minsky said was most dangerous ponzi financing is where borrowers lack the cash flow to cover either interest or principal their plan if you can call it that is to flip the underlying asset at a higher price repay the debt and book a profitponzi financing can work sometimes people have good timing or just good luck and buy a leveraged asset before it tops out the housing bull market of – when people with almost no credit were buying and flipping houses and making money attracted more and more people and created a soaring market the phenomenon fed on itself bull markets in houses stocks or anything else can go higher and persist longer than we skeptics think is possible that is what makes them so dangerousminsky’s unique contribution here is the sequencing of events protracted stable periods where hedge financing works encourage both borrowers and lenders to take more risk eventually onceprudent practices give way to ponzi schemes at some point asset values stop going up they don’t have to fall mind you just stop rising that’s when crisis hitsthe economist described this process well in a  minsky profile article emphasis mineeconomies dominated by hedge financing – that is those with strong cashflows and low debt levels – are the most stable when speculative and especially ponzi financing come to the fore financial systems are more vulnerable if asset values start to fall either because of monetary tightening or some external shock the most overstretched firms will be forced to sell their positions this further undermines asset values causing pain for even more firms they could avoid this trouble by restricting themselves to hedge financing but over time particularly when the economy is in fine fettle the temptation to take on debt is irresistible when growth looks assured why not borrow more banks add to the dynamic lowering their credit standards the longer booms last if defaults are minimal why not lend more minsky’s conclusion was unsettling economic stability breeds instability periods of prosperity give way to financial fragilityminsky’s conclusions are indeed unsettling he called into question the belief that markets left to operate unimpeded will deliver stability and prosperity to all minsky thought the opposite markets are not efficient at all and the result is an occasional financial crisiscomplacency in the midst of a wanton debt buildup was beautifully expressed in a remark by citigroup chairman chuck prince in   the citigroup chief executive told the financial times that the party would end at some point but there was so much liquidity it would not be disrupted by the turmoil in the us subprime mortgage markethe denied that citigroup one of the biggest providers of finance to private equity deals was pulling back“when the music stops in terms of liquidity things will be complicated but as long as the music is playing you’ve got to get up and dance we’re still dancing” sourceminsky wasn’t around to see the  crisis that fit right into his theory paul mcculley attached minsky’s name to it though and now we refer to these crises as “minsky moments”are we closing in on one nowlearning the rulesas i mentioned technology stocks suffered from a little anxiety attack in the markets last week it didn’t not last long and really wasn’t all that serious yet it was nothing worse than what everyone called “normal volatility” ten years ago but the lack of concern it generated this time is not bullish in my view more than a few investors seem to think that “nowhere but up” is somehow normaldoug kass had similar thoughts there’s that zeitgeist trope thing again and reminded us all of bob farrell’s famous ten rules of investing you could write a book about each one of them i’ll just list them quickly then apply some of them to our current situation emphasis mine markets tend to return to the mean over time excesses in one direction will lead to an opposite excess in the other direction there are no new eras – excesses are never permanent exponential rapidly rising or falling markets usually go further than you think but they do not correct by going sideways the public buys most at the top and the least at the bottom fear and greed are stronger than longterm resolve markets are strongest when they are broad and weakest when they narrow to a handful of bluechip names sound familiar can you say faangs bear markets have three stages sharp down reflexive rebound and a drawnout fundamental downtrend when all the experts and forecasts agree something else is going to happen bull markets are more fun than bear marketsi think most of these rules are obvious to investors who experienced the  mess the dotcom crash and if you’re of a certain age the  black monday some of us can remember  and ’ ’ was especially ugly i had just gotten my master of divinity degree and all i knew was that the job market sucked maybe we mostly forget these experiences but hopefully we pick up a little wisdom along the way the problem is that now a new generation of investors lacks this perspective they had little or no stock exposure in  and experienced the great recession as more of a jobloss or housing crisis than a stock market crisisof course the previous crises are no secret people know about them and on some level they know the bear will come prowling around again eventually but knowing history isn’t the same as living through it newer investors may not notice the signs of a top as readily as do investors who have seen those signs before – and who maybe got punished for ignoring them at the timedoug kass notices here’s a bit from an email conversation we had last weekduring the dotcom boom in  to early  there was the promise and dream of a new paradigm and concentration of performance in a select universe of stocks the nasdaq subsequently dropped by about  over the next few yearsi got to thinking how many conditions that existed back then exist today – most importantly like in  when there emerged the untimely notion of “the long boom” in wired magazine it was a new paradigm of a likely extended period of uninterrupted economic prosperity and became an accepted investment feature and concept in support of higher stock pricesand in  newfangled financial weapons of mass destruction – such as subprime mortgages that were sliced and diced during a worldwide stretch for yield – were seen as safe by all but a fewand just like during those previous periods of speculative excesses many of the same strategists commentators and money managers who failed to warn us then are now ignoringdismissing their favorite phrase is that the “macroeconomic backdrop is benign” the large systemic risks that arguably have contributed to an overvalued and overloved us stock marketdoug points especially to farrell’s rule  on market breadth a rally led by a few intensely popular mustown stocks is much less sustainable than one that lifts all boats we see it right now in the swelling interest in faang facebook apple amazon netflix google tesla comes to mind too their influence on the capweighted indexes is undeniably distorting the market these situations rarely end wellchinese minskywhat is behind these distortions ultimately it’s about capital flows asset prices rise when demand outstrips supply which is what happens when stocks or real estate or whatever are perceived as more rewarding than cash those with the most unwanted cash compete with each other to buy the alternativesthe fed and other developedcountry central banks created a lot of liquidity in recent years so that’s undoubtedly a factor an even greater one may be china thoughconsider china’s explosive growth its proximate cause is us demand and to a lesser extent european demand for chinese exports we sent them our dollars and euros they sent us widgets and doodads us dollars inside china are undesirable to wealthy chinese and the chinese government so they send the dollars right back to us in exchange for other assets homes commercial real estate stocks treasury bonds entire companiesmeanwhile within china the government aggressively encourages lending for projects a free economy would never produce let me make a critical point here while the central bank of china is not doing much in the way of quantitative easing the government’s use of bank lending gone wild is essentially the same thing the banks have created multiple trillions of yuan every year for many years if you add chinese bank lending statistics to the quantitative easing statistics of the world’s major central banks the number is staggering i think it’s entirely appropriate to perform that calculationbeijing thinks this massive bank lending is useful in keeping the population happy employed and satisfied with their government it has worked pretty well too it can’t work indefinitely but the government seems bent on trying consider this june  wall street journal reportwhile beijing is carrying out a highprofile campaign to reduce leverage in its financial markets with one hand with the other it is encouraging more potentially reckless borrowing this week the regulator put pressure on the country’s big banks to lend more to small companies and farmers while the government announced tax breaks for financial institutions that lend to rural households that follows recent guidance that banks should set up “inclusive finance” unitsif the goal of lending to poorer customers sounds noble the concern is that the execution will only worsen chinese banks’ existing problems namely high levels of bad loans and swaths of mispriced credit bank lending to small companies is already growing pretty fast with nontrivial sums involved it jumped  in the year through march to  trillion yuan  trillion that compares favorably with the  rise in loans to large and mediumsize companies over the same periodobservers like me have been saying for years that china’s banking system is overleveraged and will eventually collapse we’ve been wrong so far beijing’s central planners may be communists but they use the capitalist toolbox to their advantage china will eventually face a reckoning when it does the impact will spread far outside china what do you think will happen when chinese money stops buying vancouver real estate and us stocks the outcome won’t be bullishthe swiss national bank is doing whatpity the poor swiss government they have run their country well and don’t have a great deal of debt they are a small country of just  million people but they make an outsized impact on economics and finance and moneybecause switzerland is considered a safe haven and a wellrun country many people would like to hold large amounts of their assets in the swiss franc which makes the swiss franc intolerably strong for swiss businesses and citizens so the swiss national bank snb has to print a great deal of money and use nonconventional means to hold down the value of their currency their overnight repo rate is  that’s right they charge you a little less than  a year just for the pleasure of letting your cash sit in a swiss bank depositand the snb is buying massive quantities of dollars and euros paid for by printing hundreds of billions in swiss francs the snb owns about  billion in us stocks today june  and a guesstimated  billion or so in european stocks which guess comes from my friend grant williams so i will go with itthey have bought roughly  billion worth of us stocks so far this year they have no formula they are just trying to manage their currency think about this for a moment they have about  in us stocks on their books for every man woman and child in switzerland not to mention who knows how much in other assorted assets all in the effort to keep a lid on what is still one of the most expensive currencies in the world i gasp at prices every time i go to switzerland i will be in lugano for the first time this fallswitzerland is now the eighthlargest public holder of us stocks it has got to be one of the largest holders of apple see below what happens when there is a bear market who bears the losses print just more money to make up the difference on the balance sheet do we even care what the swiss national bank balance sheet looks like more importantly do they really care we all remember european central bank president mario draghi’s famous remark that he would do “whatever it takes” to defend the euro we could hear the swiss singing from the same hymnbook by and bythe point is that central banks and governments all the world are flooding the market with liquidity which is showing up in the private asset markets in stock and housing and real estate and bond prices creating an unquenchable desire for what appear to be cheap but are actually overvalued assets – which is what creates a minsky momentnow remember what minsky said when an economy reaches the ponzifinancing stage it becomes extremely sensitive to asset prices any downturn or even an extended flat period can trigger a crisiswhile we have many domestic issues that could act as that trigger i see a high likelihood that the next minsky moment will propagate from china or europe all the necessary excesses and transmission channels are in place the hard part of course is the timing the happy daze can linger far longer than any of us anticipate then again some seemingly insignificant event in europe or china – an austrian archduke’s being assassinated or what have you – can cause the world to unravelit’s a funny world we have our rashes of zombie moves and  people in all corners of the planet inventing the same thing at the same time and we have our central banks and governments exhibiting unmistakable herd behavior and continuing to do the same foolish things over and over they never really intend to have the crisis that ensuesremember farrell’s rule  there are no new eras the world changes but danger remains gravity always wins eventually it will win this time too and when it does we will begin undergo the great reset lewis  don’t eat fortune’s cookie    by michael lewisjune  princeton universitythank you president tilghman trustees and friends parents of the class of  above all members of the princeton class of  give yourself a round of applause the next time you look around a church and see everyone dressed in black it’ll be awkward to cheer enjoy the momentthirty years ago i sat where you sat i must have listened to some older person share his life experience but i don’t remember a word of it i can’t even tell you who spoke what i do remember vividly is graduation i’m told you’re meant to be excited perhaps even relieved and maybe all of you are i wasn’t i was totally outraged here i’d gone and given them four of the best years of my life and this is how they thanked me for it by kicking me outat that moment i was sure of only one thing i was of no possible economic value to the outside world i’d majored in art history for a start even then this was regarded as an act of insanity i was almost certainly less prepared for the marketplace than most of you yet somehow i have wound up rich and famous well sort of i’m going to explain briefly how that happened i want you to understand just how mysterious careers can be before you go out and have one yourselfi graduated from princeton without ever having published a word of anything anywhere i didn’t write for the prince or for anyone else but at princeton studying art history i felt the first twinge of literary ambition it happened while working on my senior thesis my adviser was a truly gifted professor an archaeologist named william childs the thesis tried to explain how the italian sculptor donatello used greek and roman sculpture — which is actually totally beside the point but i’ve always wanted to tell someone god knows what professor childs actually thought of it but he helped me to become engrossed more than engrossed obsessed when i handed it in i knew what i wanted to do for the rest of my life to write senior theses or to put it differently to write booksthen i went to my thesis defense it was just a few yards from here in mccormick hall i listened and waited for professor childs to say how well written my thesis was he didn’t and so after about  minutes i finally said “so what did you think of the writing”“put it this way” he said “never try to make a living at it”and i didn’t — not really i did what everyone does who has no idea what to do with themselves i went to graduate school i wrote at nights without much effect mainly because i hadn’t the first clue what i should write about one night i was invited to a dinner where i sat next to the wife of a big shot at a giant wall street investment bank called salomon brothers she more or less forced her husband to give me a job i knew next to nothing about salomon brothers but salomon brothers happened to be where wall street was being reinvented—into the place we have all come to know and love when i got there i was assigned almost arbitrarily to the very best job in which to observe the growing madness they turned me into the house expert on derivatives a year and a half later salomon brothers was handing me a check for hundreds of thousands of dollars to give advice about derivatives to professional investorsnow i had something to write about salomon brothers wall street had become so unhinged that it was paying recent princeton graduates who knew nothing about money small fortunes to pretend to be experts about money i’d stumbled into my next senior thesisi called up my father i told him i was going to quit this job that now promised me millions of dollars to write a book for an advance of  grand there was a long pause on the other end of the line “you might just want to think about that” he said“why”“stay at salomon brothers  years make your fortune and then write your books” he saidi didn’t need to think about it i knew what intellectual passion felt like — because i’d felt it here at princeton — and i wanted to feel it again i was  years old had i waited until i was  i would never have done it i would have forgotten the feelingthe book i wrote was called “liar’s poker” it sold a million copies i was  years old i had a career a little fame a small fortune and a new life narrative all of a sudden people were telling me i was born to be a writer this was absurd even i could see there was another truer narrative with luck as its theme what were the odds of being seated at that dinner next to that salomon brothers lady of landing inside the best wall street firm from which to write the story of an age of landing in the seat with the best view of the business of having parents who didn’t disinherit me but instead sighed and said “do it if you must” of having had that sense of must kindled inside me by a professor of art history at princeton of having been let into princeton in the first placethis isn’t just false humility it’s false humility with a point my case illustrates how success is always rationalized people really don’t like to hear success explained away as luck — especially successful people as they age and succeed people feel their success was somehow inevitable they don’t want to acknowledge the role played by accident in their lives there is a reason for this the world does not want to acknowledge it eitheri wrote a book about this called “moneyball” it was ostensibly about baseball but was in fact about something else there are poor teams and rich teams in professional baseball and they spend radically different sums of money on their players when i wrote my book the richest team in professional baseball the new york yankees was then spending about  million on its  players the poorest team the oakland a’s was spending about  million and yet the oakland team was winning as many games as the yankees — and more than all the other richer teamsthis isn’t supposed to happen in theory the rich teams should buy the best players and win all the time but the oakland team had figured something out the rich teams didn’t really understand who the best baseball players were the players were misvalued and the biggest single reason they were misvalued was that the experts did not pay sufficient attention to the role of luck in baseball success players got given credit for things they did that depended on the performance of others pitchers got paid for winning games hitters got paid for knocking in runners on base players got blamed and credited for events beyond their control where balls that got hit happened to land on the field for exampleforget baseball forget sports here you had these corporate employees paid millions of dollars a year they were doing exactly the same job that people in their business had been doing forever in front of millions of people who evaluate their every move they had statistics attached to everything they did and yet they were misvalued — because the wider world was blind to their luckthis had been going on for a century right under all of our noses and no one noticed — until it paid a poor team so well to notice that they could not afford not to notice and you have to ask if a professional athlete paid millions of dollars can be misvalued who can’t be if the supposedly pure meritocracy of professional sports can’t distinguish between lucky and good who canthe “moneyball” story has practical implications if you use better data you can find better values there are always market inefficiencies to exploit and so on but it has a broader and less practical message don’t be deceived by life’s outcomes life’s outcomes while not entirely random have a huge amount of luck baked into them above all recognize that if you have had success you have also had luck — and with luck comes obligation you owe a debt and not just to your gods you owe a debt to the unluckyi make this point because — along with this speech — it is something that will be easy for you to forgeti now live in berkeley california a few years ago just a few blocks from my home a pair of researchers in the cal psychology department staged an experiment they began by grabbing students as lab rats then they broke the students into teams segregated by sex three men or three women per team then they put these teams of three into a room and arbitrarily assigned one of the three to act as leader then they gave them some complicated moral problem to solve say what should be done about academic cheating or how to regulate drinking on campusexactly  minutes into the problemsolving the researchers interrupted each group they entered the room bearing a plate of cookies four cookies the team consisted of three people but there were these four cookies every team member obviously got one cookie but that left a fourth cookie just sitting there it should have been awkward but it wasn’t with incredible consistency the person arbitrarily appointed leader of the group grabbed the fourth cookie and ate it not only ate it but ate it with gusto lips smacking mouth open drool at the corners of their mouths in the end all that was left of the extra cookie were crumbs on the leader’s shirtthis leader had performed no special task he had no special virtue he’d been chosen at random  minutes earlier his status was nothing but luck but it still left him with the sense that the cookie should be histhis experiment helps to explain wall street bonuses and ceo pay and i’m sure lots of other human behavior but it also is relevant to new graduates of princeton university in a general sort of way you have been appointed the leader of the group your appointment may not be entirely arbitrary but you must sense its arbitrary aspect you are the lucky few lucky in your parents lucky in your country lucky that a place like princeton exists that can take in lucky people introduce them to other lucky people and increase their chances of becoming even luckier lucky that you live in the richest society the world has ever seen in a time when no one actually expects you to sacrifice your interests to anythingall of you have been faced with the extra cookie all of you will be faced with many more of them in time you will find it easy to assume that you deserve the extra cookie for all i know you may but you’ll

extreme  today us banks report credit metrics in many loan categories that are not merely too good but are entirely anomalous  negative default rates for example are a red flaga decade ago the more aggressive lenders such as wachovia countrywide and washington mutual were actually reporting negative net default rates suggesting that extending credit had no cost – in large part because the value of the collateral behind the loans was rising in value in those heady days of comfortable collective delusions noncurrent rates for  family loans were below  the lowest levels of delinquency since the early sthis situation changed rather dramatically by  when several large westcoast nonbank mortgage lenders collapsed  by the start of  funding for banks nonbanks and even the gses was drying up and default rates were rising rapidly  the cost of credit reappeared netcharge off rates for  family loans in particular went from  early in  to  by the end of  and peaked at  by the end of    today the irrational exuberance of the federal open market committee has created huge asset price bubbles in sectors such as residential and commercial real estate  a combination of low rates a dearth of home builders down  from  k firms in  to  k firms today and even less construction  development cd lending down   has constrained the supply of homes  but low rates sent prices for existing homes soaring multiples of annual gdp growth – both for singlefamily and multifamily propertieskeep in mind that the folks on the federal reserve board think that asset price inflation is helpful – thus the “wealth effect”  specifically the fomc believes that manipulating risk preferences credit spreads and therefore asset prices helps the economy to generate more income and employment many analysts have debunked the notion of a “wealth effect” but the fomc persists in this thinking even today  mohamed eerian writing in bloomberg has it right“forced to use the asset channel as the main vehicle for pursuing its macroeconomic growth and inflation objectives – that is boosting asset prices to make consumers feel wealthier and spend more and also to increase corporate investments by fueling animal spirits – the fed has ended up providing exceptional multiyear support to financial markets using an experimental array of unconventional tools and forward policy guidance indeed most investors and traders are now conditioned to expect soothing words from central bankers – and if needed policy actions – the minute markets hit a rough patch virtually regardless of the reason”in an economic sense the federal open market committee is the heart of the administrative state the use of the “asset channel” to pretend to boost economic activity is part of the larger delusion at the fed known as “macroprudential” policy  the macroprudential worldview sees the fed as an all knowing allseeing global managerial agency that can somehow balance goosing economic growth using asset bubbles with preventing the associated systemic risks note that regulating whole industries and constraining growth is in fact a key part of the fed’s macropru modelhaving maintained low interest rates and used trillions of dollars of bank reserves to fund open market purchases of treasury bonds and agency mortgage paper the fomc now faces an asset market that has understated the cost of credit for over a decade  from  through  and then  through today the fomc has boosted asset prices – but without a commensurate and necessary increase in income  the fed has to paraphrase elerian decoupled prices from fundamentals and distorted asset allocation in markets and the economyso the question that concerns the ira is when will the credit cycle turn and how much of the apparently benign credit picture we see today is a function of the fed’s social engineering  if this latest round of fed “ease” is more radical than that seen in the early s will we see an even sharper uptick in bank loan loss rates than we saw in so how does this all end  in the short term look for default rates on consumer exposures to continue rising  but in asset classes like commercial real estate residential homes and cd lending we suspect that the party may continue at least in statistical terms through at least the end of the yearafter that however we full expect to see loss rates and lgds start to snap back to the middle of the proverbial distribution as one wellplaced bank ceo told the ira over breakfast “there are lots of sweaty palms” in the new york commercial real estate market  read this little missive in the new york times about the park lane hotel to get a sense of the level of exuberance in the commercial real estate market in gothamwithout a rather robust confirmation of asset prices with rising incomes as elerian and many others have observed current levels of assets prices are unlikely to be maintained  in the event look for bank default and recovery rates to normalize with a sharp increase in credit costs for lenders and bond investors aliketrees do not grow to the sky credit costs are never really negative and last we looked fed chairs cannot fly through the air or spin straw into gold  but they can manipulate asset prices and cause other mischief that we suspect represents a net cost to consumers and investors alike  but this is hardly a novel state of affairsin that regard we appreciate your comments about our earlier missive “buy britain sell europe” many of you challenged our idea that britain is an enduring nation state while the eu is merely a bad idea whose sell by date has passed  to address these comments we refer to one of our favorite reads of late “playing catch up” by wolfgang streeck the emeritus director of the max planck institute for the study of societies in cologne streeck writes regularly for the london review of books he is ready to suspend democratic processes to support “willing governments” that advance germanstyle reforms but streeck has a cogent view of the european political economy“here as so often in her long career merkel is anything but dogmatic and certainly isn’t beholden to ordoliberal orthodoxy since what is at stake is germany’s most precious historical achievement secure access to foreign markets at a low and stable exchange rate  for several years now berlin has allowed the european central bank under draghi and the european commission under juncker to invent ever new ways of circumventing the maastricht treaties from financing government deficits to subsidising ailing banks none of this has done anything to resolve the fundamental structural problems of the eurozone what it has done is what it was intended to do buy time from election to election for european governments to carry out neoliberal reforms and for germany to enjoy yet another year of prosperity”sound familiar  in the us as well as europe what passes for fiscal and monetary policy are merely a series of shortterm expedients meant to get us from one day to the next  the nonsense of macroprudential policy represents the apex of such thinking  as we look out to credit conditions in the us banking sector in h  and beyond the one sure bet is that the cost of credit will not remain suppressed forever  mauldin  the great reset    by john mauldinmauldin economimcsmay  the great resetwe are coming to a period i call the great reset as it hits we will have to deal one way or another with the largest twin bubbles in the history of the world global debt especially government debt and the even larger bubble of government promises we are talking about debt and unfunded promises to the tune of multiple hundreds of trillions of dollars – vastly larger than global gdp we are also going to have to restructure our economies and in particular how we approach employment because of the massive technological transformation that is taking place but let’s keep the focus for now on global debt and government promisesall that debt cannot be repaid under current arrangements nor can those promises ultimately be kept there is simply not enough money and not enough growth and these bubbles are continuing to grow at some point we’re going to have to deal with these issues and restructure everythingnow people have been saying that for years remember ross perot and his charts in the early s we’ve all heard the doom and gloom predictions of the demise of civilization that will be brought on by our social security andor healthcare andor pension problemsand yet these are real problems we must face facing them won’t be the end of the world but it will mean we must forge a different social contract and make changes to taxes and the economy that said the day of reckoning is not here yet we have time to adjust and prepare but i believe that within the next – years we have to confront the ending of the debt and government promises supercycle that has been developing since the late s this is a global problem but it will be felt most acutely in the developed world and china the developing and frontier markets will be radically affected as well but mostly by fallout from the impacts on the developed worldthere has been no instance in history when too much debt didn’t eventually have to be dealt with the even more massive bubble of government promises will have to be dealt with too we need some realistic way to decide how to meet those promises or at least the portion of them that can be metfor the record what i mean by government promises are pensions and healthcare benefits in all their myriad varieties governments everywhere guaranteed these benefits assuming that taxes would cover their immediate costs and future politicians would figure out the rest now the time is rapidly approaching when those “future politicians” are the ones we elect in the here and nowwhat happened to deleveragingtypically after a significant recession there is a deleveraging of society that’s certainly what many expected in  individuals in some countries did in fact reduce their debts but not governments and corporations or most individuals outside the usthat the world is awash in debt is not exactly news as of  total global debt had risen to  trillion growing some  trillion in just the previous seven years about  trillion a year the mckinsey institute chart below shows  advanced and  developing countries that make up the bulk of the world economy the chart illustrates how the debt is split among household corporate government and financial sectors the debttogdp ratio increased in all advanced economies from  through  and the trend is continuing here’s a chart for the advanced and developing economies since that  report was published global debt rose by  trillion through q  in fact in the first nine months of  global debt rose  trillion after averaging a little over  trillion from  through  global debt growth is now accelerating global debttogdp is now  though it varies sharply by region and countrymore worrisome is that interest rates are slowly rising pretty much everywhere so debtservicing costs are rising too in the us according to a note sent to me recently by my friend terry savage interest on the national debt is the third largest component of our annual federal budget – after social programs and military spending in the most recent fiscal year we paid  billion in interest on the national debt that was a relatively low cost because the fed has kept interest rates artificially low for years – as savers can attestnow with the fed hiking rates interest costs are set to soar  the congressional budget office estimates that every percentage point hike in rates will cost  trillion over the next ten years and that’s without adding to the debt itself every year by running budget deficitsthat  rate hike will take roughly an additional  of our current tax revenues every year governments must cover higher interest costs with additional taxes lower spending or an increase in the deficit which means more total debt and even more interest rate cost of course higher interest rates affect more than just government interest rates many of us have adjustablerate mortgages and other loans with floating interest ratesit is not just the us that faces a serious debt problem global gdp is roughly  trillion if interest rates were to rise just  on our global debt an additional  trillion of that gdp would go to pay that debt increase or about  of global gdp as we have discussed many times debt is a limiting factor on future growth debt is future consumption brought forward repaying that debt requires either reduced future consumption or some kind of debt liquidation – those are the only choicesdebt has additional consequences i have highlighted research from my friends lacy hunt and van hoisington that correlates increased total debt with slower overall growth the graph below from hoisington investment management shows total debt as a percentage of gdp for the major developed countriesnote that japan with by far the highest debttogdp ratio is growing slower than europe which is growing slower than the us china’s debt is rapidly overtaking the us’s debt and at its current growth rate it will soon overtake europe’s the grand chinese debt experiment will eventually reveal the true linkage between the size of debt and growthunfunded liabilitiesa citibank report shows that the oecd countries face  trillion in unfunded pension liabilities that is at least  more than their total gdp pension obligations are growing faster than gdp in most of those countries if not all those are obligations on top of their total debtby the way most of those pension obligations are theoretically funded from future returns which are going to be sparse to nonexistent that means obligations are compounding significantly faster than the ability to pay them without serious adjustments to either benefits or funding there is literally no hope of catching upthought exercise in european countries where taxes are already more than  of gdp where will they find an extra – to meet those future pension obligations how long will younger generations tolerate carrying older generations when the government is taking two thirds of their paychecks you can begin to see the scope of the problem  sometime this year world public and private debt plus unfunded pensions will surpass  trillion – not counting the  trillion in us government unfunded liabilities oopsthese obligations simply cannot be paid a time is coming when the market and voters will realize that these obligations cannot be met will voters decide to tax “the rich” more will they increase their vat rates and further slow growth will they reduce benefits no matter what they decide hard choices will bring political turmoil which will mean market turmoilthe unthinkable recessionhistory shows it is more than likely that the us will have a recession in the next few years although one doesn’t appear to be on the near horizon but when it does come it will likely blow the us government deficit up to  trillion a year obama took eight years to run up a  trillion debt after the  recession it might take just five years after the next recession to run up the next  trillion here is a chart my staff created in late  using congressional budget office data showing what will happen in the next recession if revenues drop by the same percentage as they did in the last recession without even counting likely higher expenditures this time and you can add the  trillion deficit in this chart to the more than  billion in offbudget debt plus higher interest rate expense as interest rates rise whether the catalyst is a european recession that spills over into the us or one triggered by us monetary and fiscal mistakes or a funding crisis in china or an emergingmarket meltdown the next recession will be just as global as the last one and there will be more buildup of debt and more political and economic chaospresident trump is a fairly controversial figure but i think most of us can agree that trump is going to make volatility great again the great reset will bring an increase in volatility and the correlation among asset classes will once again approach  as it did during –if i’m right about the growing debt burden the recovery from the next recession may be even slower than the last recovery has been – unless the recession is so deep that we have a complete reset of all asset valuations i don’t believe politicians and central banks will allow that they will print and try to hold on as long as possible thwarting any normal recovery until markets force their handsbut then i can think of at least three or four ways that politicians and central bankers could react during the great reset and each will bring a different type of volatility and effects on valuations flexibility will be critical to successful investing in the future previous a source of news

lionscrest capital home tail risk blog resources books contact disclosures the dao of capital austrian investing in a distorted world as todays preeminent doomsday investor mark spitznagel describes his daoist and roundabout investment approach “one gains by losing and loses by gaining”   this is austrian investing an archetypal counterintuitive and proven approach gleaned from the yearold austrian school of economics that is both timeless and exceedingly timely in the dao of capital hedge fund manager and tailhedging pioneer mark spitznagel—with one of the top returns on capital of the financial crisis as well as over a career—takes us on a gripping circuitous journey from the chicago trading pits over the coniferous boreal forests and canonical strategists from warring states china to napoleonic europe to burgeoning industrial america to the great economic thinkers of late th century austria we arrive at his central investment methodology of austrian investing where victory comes not from waging the immediate decisive battle but rather from the roundabout approach of seeking the intermediate positional advantage what he calls shi of aiming at the indirect means rather than directly at the ends the monumental challenge is in seeing time differently in a whole new intertemporal dimension one that is so contrary to our wiring spitznagel is the first to condense the theories of ludwig von mises and his austrian school of economics into a cohesive and—as spitznagel has shown—highly effective investment methodology from identifying the monetary distortions and nonrandomness of stock market routs spitznagels bread and butter to scorned highlyproductive assets in ron pauls words from the foreword spitznagel “brings austrian economics from the ivory tower to the investment portfolio”  the dao of capital provides a rare and accessible look through the lens of one of todays great investors to discover a profound harmony with the market process—a harmony that is so essential today further reading  the dao of capital website the financial times lexicon  austrian economicsa school of economic thought originating in austria in the late nineteenth century which focuses on the concept of opportunity cost  in economic theory the term austrian school stands for liberalism and laissezfaireeconomics where economic performance is optimised when there is limited government interferencethe austrian school of economics has its original roots in the work of carl menger from the university of vienna  references to the topic were first published in  wellknown followers of menger included eugen von böhmbawerk  –  ludwig von mises  –  and perhaps most important friedrich a hayek  – hayek for example strongly rejected any intervention by the state in the economy for him markets work perfectly in the sense that the market price balances supply and demand  a perfect market is one characterised by easy access to information no barriers to entry and with prices controlled by all participantsdue to the global financial crisis of  and  the popularity of the austrian school of economics has experienced a boost in recent times because it had predicted a long time ago that too much debt – due to too low interest rates – would trigger investment bubbles followed by a crisis after these bubbles burst  for example look at ireland’s property bubble which was fuelled by reckless lending by banks to property developersin contrast to keynesianism the austrian school of thought holds that the business cycle is driven by the supply side of the economy not demand if interest rates are too low we will have overinvestment this may lead to overproduction which may trigger a crisis during the crisis supply declines until it is once again equal to overall demand then a new cycle startsfor the austrian school the main challenge is not inflation but overinvestment in the face of too much money or toolow interest rates that can lead to a crisis  too much money means that the growth of money supply is much higher than the growth of goods and services in an economy this leads to inflation which is an increase in the average prices of all goods because there is more money availablethis means that the right level of the interest rate called the ‘natural rate of interest’ is crucial to prevent a crisis this type of interest rate attracts enough investment to ensure full employment and no inflation if the actual rate is equal to the natural rate there is no inflationfurther reading  ludwig von mises institute  austrian school
