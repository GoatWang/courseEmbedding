 references  external links historyedit in  british oil entrepreneur lord cowdray formed amerada corporation to explore for oil in north america the firm was incorporated feb   in delaware as a holding company for its principal subsidiary the amerada petroleum corporation the oil producer experienced growth during most of the s hitting a peak in  with a net income of us million however in the years leading to the great depression weakness in the oil markets contributed to sluggish profits the aftermath of the market crash aggravated the unsteady oil industry in the first quarter of  the company experienced a minor loss the early years of the depression was a struggle against wavering demand and overproduction in some regions later into the s the financial forecast became more sanguine for amerada in december  the company reorganized by merging the holding company with the principal operating subsidiary amerada petroleum corporation into a simplified operating company the new entity also adopted the former subsidiarys name robust postwar growth rocketed the company past us million in sales in  hess oil and chemical an oil refiner and marketer founded by leon hess acquired  of the company for us million in  after the british government sold a stake it had amassed during world war ii albert levinson became the senior vice president and designed the hess logo hess and amerada would announce plans for a merger in december  some amerada stockholders led by morton adler criticized the arrangement as being too favorable for hess adler argued ameradas oil reserves would contribute the lions share of assets for the proposed company so amerada stockholders should retain more control of the new company before the stockholder vote on the matter phillips petroleum an integrated oil firm approached amerada with its own merger proposal but the offer was declined in march still interested phillips nonetheless stated it would not carry out a proxy fight against the proposed hess deal hess fearing such a strategy made a cash tender offer of us million for an additional  million shares of amerada which would double its holding in the company the new shares would be employed in a may stockholder vote deciding the mergers fate the vote took place amidst shareholder rancor that in addition to echoing adlers arguments objected to ameradas financing of the recently completed tender offer hess planned to cancel the shares and the cost of the acquisition would be absorbed by the newly formed company one shareholder at the meeting quipped it looks to me as if hess is buying amerada with ameradas money proponents of the deal won and the us billion merger combining a purely production company with a refinery and marketer operation was completed however controversy was not yet extinguished by the stockholder confirmation a class action federal lawsuit in  claiming the proxy vote information was misleading in  a court agreed that the company falsely claimed to have considered each companys assets as a reason for the merger a former hess station in rensselaer county new york in february  hess acquired the  shares of the meadville corporation it didnt already own and rebranded all  merit gas stations as hess the merit gas station chain were primarily in the boston new york and philadelphia markets in  amerada hess purchased triton energy limited in a cash tender deal valued at approximately us billion triton one of the largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the us had earned a reputation as a maverick oil company due to its highly successful yet potentially risky overseas exploration according to amerada hess press releases at the time tritons major oil and gas assets in west africa latin america and southeast asia would strengthen its exploration and production business and give it access to long life international reserves hess also stated that the purchase was expected to immediately increase the companys perday barrel output by more than  percent also in  amerada hess entered into a joint venture with at williams oil co of winstonsalem north carolina the

environmental record  locations  toy trucks  models  miniature trucks  references  external links historyedit in  british oil entrepreneur lord cowdray formed amerada corporation to explore for oil in north america the firm was incorporated feb   in delaware as a holding company for its principal subsidiary the amerada petroleum corporation the oil producer experienced growth during most of the s hitting a peak in  with a net income of us million however in the years leading to the great depression weakness in the oil markets contributed to sluggish profits the aftermath of the market crash aggravated the unsteady oil industry in the first quarter of  the company experienced a minor loss the early years of the depression was a struggle against wavering demand and overproduction in some regions later into the s the financial forecast became more sanguine for amerada in december  the company reorganized by merging the holding company with the principal operating subsidiary amerada petroleum corporation into a simplified operating company the new entity also adopted the former subsidiarys name robust postwar growth rocketed the company past us million in sales in  hess oil and chemical an oil refiner and marketer founded by leon hess acquired  of the company for us million in  after the british government sold a stake it had amassed during world war ii albert levinson became the senior vice president and designed the hess logo hess and amerada would announce plans for a merger in december  some amerada stockholders led by morton adler criticized the arrangement as being too favorable for hess adler argued ameradas oil reserves would contribute the lions share of assets for the proposed company so amerada stockholders should retain more control of the new company before the stockholder vote on the matter phillips petroleum an integrated oil firm approached amerada with its own merger proposal but the offer was declined in march still interested phillips nonetheless stated it would not carry out a proxy fight against the proposed hess deal hess fearing such a strategy made a cash tender offer of us million for an additional  million shares of amerada which would double its holding in the company the new shares would be employed in a may stockholder vote deciding the mergers fate the vote took place amidst shareholder rancor that in addition to echoing adlers arguments objected to ameradas financing of the recently completed tender offer hess planned to cancel the shares and the cost of the acquisition would be absorbed by the newly formed company one shareholder at the meeting quipped it looks to me as if hess is buying amerada with ameradas money proponents of the deal won and the us billion merger combining a purely production company with a refinery and marketer operation was completed however controversy was not yet extinguished by the stockholder confirmation a class action federal lawsuit in  claiming the proxy vote information was misleading in  a court agreed that the company falsely claimed to have considered each companys assets as a reason for the merger a former hess station in rensselaer county

historyedit in  british oil entrepreneur lord cowdray formed amerada corporation to explore for oil in north america the firm was incorporated feb   in delaware as a holding company for its principal subsidiary the amerada petroleum corporation the oil producer experienced growth during most of the s hitting a peak in  with a net income of us million however in the years leading to the great depression weakness in the oil markets contributed to sluggish profits the aftermath of the market crash aggravated the unsteady oil industry in the first quarter of  the company experienced a minor loss the early years of the depression was a struggle against wavering demand and overproduction in some regions later into the s the financial forecast became more sanguine for amerada in december  the company reorganized by merging the holding company with the principal operating subsidiary amerada petroleum corporation into a simplified operating company the new entity also adopted the former subsidiarys name robust postwar growth rocketed the company past us million in sales in  hess oil and chemical an oil refiner and marketer founded by leon hess acquired  of the company for us million in  after the british government sold a stake it had amassed during world war ii albert levinson became the senior vice president and designed the hess logo hess and amerada would announce plans for a merger in december  some amerada stockholders led by morton adler criticized the arrangement as being too favorable for hess adler argued ameradas oil reserves would contribute the lions share of assets for the proposed company so amerada stockholders should retain more control of the new company before the stockholder vote on the matter phillips petroleum an integrated oil firm approached amerada with its own merger proposal but the offer was declined in march still interested phillips nonetheless stated it would not carry out a proxy fight against the proposed hess deal hess fearing such a strategy made a cash tender offer of us million for an additional  million shares of amerada which would double its holding in the company the new shares would be employed in a may stockholder vote deciding the mergers fate the vote took place amidst shareholder rancor that in addition to echoing adlers arguments objected to ameradas financing of the recently completed tender offer hess planned to cancel the shares and the cost of the acquisition would be absorbed by the newly formed company one shareholder at the meeting quipped it looks to me as if hess is buying amerada with ameradas money proponents of the deal won and the us billion merger combining a purely production company with a refinery and marketer operation was completed however controversy was not yet extinguished by the stockholder confirmation a class action federal lawsuit in  claiming the proxy vote information was misleading in  a court agreed that the company falsely claimed to have considered each companys assets as a reason for the merger a former hess station in rensselaer county new york in february  hess acquired the  shares of the meadville corporation it didnt already own and rebranded all  merit gas stations as hess the merit gas station chain were primarily in the boston new york and philadelphia markets in  amerada hess purchased triton energy limited in a cash tender deal valued at approximately us billion triton one of the largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the us had earned a reputation as a maverick oil company due to its highly successful yet potentially risky overseas exploration according to amerada hess press releases at the time tritons major oil and gas assets in west africa latin america and southeast asia would strengthen its exploration and production business and give it access to long life international reserves hess also stated that the purchase was expected to immediately increase the companys perday barrel output by more than  percent also in  amerada hess entered into a joint venture with at williams oil co of winstonsalem north carolina the company and its gas stations were called wilcohess eventually there were  wilcohess stations following on the heels of the triton purchase energy prices fell and global economies weakened amerada hess struggled through the following years posting a us million loss in  due primarily to a us million charge relating to its writedown of the ceiba oil field but then posting steadily increasing profits from  through  when the company posted us billion in net income in may  amerada hess corp changed its name to hess corp on january   the company announced that it would close the hovensa refinery in st croix united states virgin islands by midfebruary  the refinery will then serve as a storage terminal hess will permanently close its port reading new jersey petroleum refinery by the end of february  gas prices rose to their highest levels since october and hess said it will lay off  of  employees exit the refinery business and seek a buyer for its  storage terminals it will focus on exploration and production a hess press release announces the companys plans for fully exiting the companys downstream businesses including retail energy marketing and energy trading  there is no link between the rise in gas prices after the announcement of the closing of the woodbridge port reading nj facility the output of that facility was more geared to the aviation and specialty fuels markets and not automotive grade products on march   hess announced that it would sell its domestic refineries and retail operations and that it would also sell its holdings in indonesia and thailand the new york times also reported that hess retail and refinery operations contributed about  percent of the companys revenue it also noted that hess will sell its holdings in indonesia and thailand the company will focus exclusively on oil production following a recent trend in the oil industry for companies to spin off their downstream assets and focus on their more profitable upstream business conocophillips and marathon oil

mr holmes said the weather and wind conditions are almost as close to perfect as they could get and this contributed to a quicker and surer cleanup than could otherwise be according to the new york
