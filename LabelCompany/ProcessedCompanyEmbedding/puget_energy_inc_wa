puget energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary pse a regulated electric and natural gas utility company pse is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of washington primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission distribution and generation and natural gas distribution puget energys business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a costeffective manner through pse all of puget energys common stock is indirectly owned by puget holdings llc puget holdings puget holdings is owned by a consortium of longterm infrastructure investors including macquarie infrastructure partners i macquarie infrastructure partners ii macquarie capital group limited fss infrastructure trust the canada pension plan investment board the british columbia investment management corporation and the alberta investment management corporation puget energy and pse are collectively referred to herein as the company pse generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately  square miles principally in the puget sound region of the state of washington pse continually balances its load requirements generation resources purchase power agreements and market purchases to meet customer demand the companys external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs pse requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs factors and trends affecting pses performance the principal business economic and other factors that affect pses operations and financial performance include pses ability to recover power costs that are included in rates which are based on volume pses ability to manage costs during the rate stay out period through january   weather conditions including snowpack affecting hydrological conditions regulatory decisions allowing pse to recover purchased power and fuel costs on a timely basis pses ability to supply electricity and natural gas either through companyowned generation purchase power contracts or by procuring natural gas or electricity in wholesale markets equal sharing between pse and its customers of earnings which exceed pses authorized rate of return availability and access to capital and the cost of capital regulatory compliance costs including those related to new and developing federal regulations of electric system reliability state regulations of natural gas pipelines and federal state and local environmental laws and regulations wholesale commodity prices of electricity and natural gas increasing depreciation and amortization bonus depreciation and the impact on rate base general economic conditions in pses service territory and its effects on customer growth and usepercustomer and federal state and local taxes further detail regarding the factors and trends affecting performance of the company during the fiscal quarter ended september   is set forth below in this overview section as well as in other sections of the managements discussion and analysis regulation of pse rates and recovery of pse costs pses regulatory requirements and operational needs require the investment of substantial capital in  and future years as pse intends to seek recovery of these investments through the regulatory process its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process the rates that pse is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition results of operations and liquidity pse is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the washington utilities and transportation commission washington commission the washington commission has traditionally required these rates be determined based to a large extent on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year incremental customer growth and sales typically have not provided sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases over time due to the combined effects of regulatory lag and attrition accordingly the company will need to seek rate relief on a regular and frequent basis in the future in addition the washington commission determines whether the companys expenses and capital investments are reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost effective reliable and safe electric and natural gas service if the washington commission determines that a capital investment does not meet the reasonable and prudent standards the costs including return on any resulting rate base related to such capital investment may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates  expedited rate filing decoupling and centralia decision pse filed a settlement agreement with the washington commission on march   the agreement was intended to settle all issues regarding decoupling a power purchase agreement with transalta centralia and the expedited rate filing erf which includes the property tax tracker the washington commission placed the erf and decoupling filings under a common procedural schedule on june   the washington commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition the erf filing and the petition for reconsideration related to the transalta centralia power purchase agreement order no  in the erfdecoupling proceeding approved pses erf filing with a small change to its cost of capital from  to  to update long term debt costs and a capital structure that included  common equity with a return on equity roe of  this order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that pse and the customers will share  each in earnings in excess of the  authorized rate of return in addition the rate plan kfactor increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs to subsequently increase by  for the electric customers and  for the gas customers on january  of each year until the conclusion of pses next general rate case grc which was to be filed before april   and was later extended to january   as discussed below in the rate plan increases are subject to a cap of  of the total revenue for customers decoupling filings
