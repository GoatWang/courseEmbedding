the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time

for the quarter we are pleased that comparable sales in our physical stores improved on a sequential basis and we were able to achieve  basis points of improvement in our core merchandise margin unfortunately our fourth quarter earnings per share fell short of our expectations due to lower than expected retail store sales unanticipated operating expenses and disruption in sales at sheplerscom arising from the transition of the ecommerce site to a new software platform we are continuing to work to improve the site performance and return sheplerscom to positive sales growth” mr conroy continued “looking ahead we are excited to announce that we have further strengthened our position as the leading omnichannel western and work wear retailer in the us with the purchase of certain assets of countryoutfittercom a large pureplay ecommerce retailer targeting a younger female country customer while more difficult than anticipated we have also completed the transition of sheplerscom to our new ecommerce platform which now includes the newly acquired countryoutfittercom additionally we are encouraged that same store sales at our physical stores are improving and are positive
