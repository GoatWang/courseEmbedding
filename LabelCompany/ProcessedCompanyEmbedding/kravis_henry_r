founded in the years following world war ii which by the s and s were facing succession issues many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive henry kravis speaking at the world economic forum in  their

johnson proposed a  billion  per share management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank shearson lehman hutton and its parent company american express several days later

coinvestments from leading pension funds and other institutional investors investors included cocacola georgiapacific and united technologies corporate pension funds as well as endowments from mit harvard and the new york state common retirement fund however kkr faced criticism from existing investors over the firms use of hostile tactics in the buyout of rjr kkr proposed to provide a joint offer with johnson and shearson lehman but was rebuffed and johnson attempted to stonewall kkrs access to financial information from rjr rival private equity firm forstmann little  co was invited into the process by shearson lehman but attempted to provide a bid for rjr with a consortium of goldman sachs capital partners procter  gamble ralston purina and castle  cooke ultimately the forstmann

figure was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of rjr nabisco kkrs offer was guaranteed whereas the management offer lacked a reset meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated  per share additionally many in rjrs board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of ross johnson unprecedented golden parachute deal time magazine featured ross johnson on the cover of their december  issue along with the headline a game of greed this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a dealbreaker in kkrs favor was little more than an excuse to reject ross johnsons higher payout of  per share johnson received  million from the buyout kkr collected a  million fee in the rjr takeover at  billion of transaction value including assumed debt rjr nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price the deal was first surpassed in july  by the  billion buyout of us hospital operator hospital corporation of america in which kkr participated though the rjr deal was larger adjusted for inflation however adjusted for inflation none of the leveraged buyouts of the – period would surpass rjr nabisco the rjr transaction benefited many of the parties involved investment bankers and

early s the aftermath of rjr nabiscoedit kkrs headquarters in the solow building at  west th street in new york city the buyout of rjr nabisco was completed in april  and kkr would spend the early s repaying the rjrs enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions after the rjr nabisco deal kkr did not complete a single investment in  the first such year since  they would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of drexel burnham lambert which filed for bankruptcy in february  kkr began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late s six of kkrs portfolio companies completed ipos in

provide the company with added financial flexibility kkr contributed  billion of new equity into rjr in july  to complete a restructuring of the companys balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders kkrs equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of rjr had been only  billion in middecember  rjr announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in rjr for a new public stock in the company effectively an unusual means of taking rjr public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company rjr issued additional stock to the public in march  to further reduce debt resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of rjrs debt from junk to investment grade kkr began to reduce its ownership in rjr in  when its stock in rjr was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of borden inc a producer of food and beverage products consumer products and industrial products in an unprecedented and complex transaction  the following year in  kkr would divest itself of its final stake in rjr nabisco when borden sold a  million block of stock while kkr no longer had any ownership of rjr nabisco by  its original investment would not be fully realized until kkr exited its last investment in  after sixteen years of efforts including contributing new equity taking rjr public asset sales and exchanging shares of rjr for the ownership of borden inc kkr finally sold the last remnants of its  investment in july  kkr agreed to sell its stock in borden chemical to apollo management for  billion early s investmentsedit in the early s the absence of an active high yield market prompted kkr to change its tactics avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups one of kkrs largest investments in the s was the leveraged buildup of primedia in partnership with former executives of macmillan publishing which kkr had failed to acquire in  kkr created primedias

johnson proposed a  billion  per share management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank shearson lehman hutton and its parent company american express several days later

coinvestments from leading pension funds and other institutional investors investors included cocacola georgiapacific and united technologies corporate pension funds as well as endowments from mit harvard and the new york state common retirement fund however kkr faced criticism from existing investors over the firms use of hostile tactics in the buyout of rjr kkr proposed to provide a joint

the process by shearson lehman but attempted to provide a bid for rjr with a consortium of goldman sachs capital partners procter  gamble ralston purina and castle  cooke ultimately the forstmann

figure was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of rjr nabisco kkrs offer was guaranteed whereas the management offer lacked a reset meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated  per share additionally many in rjrs board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of ross johnson unprecedented golden parachute deal time magazine featured ross johnson on the cover of their december  issue along with the headline a game of greed this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a dealbreaker in kkrs favor was little more than an excuse to reject ross johnsons higher payout of  per share johnson received  million from the buyout kkr collected a  million fee in the rjr takeover at  billion of transaction value including assumed debt rjr nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price the deal was first surpassed in july  by the  billion buyout of us hospital operator hospital corporation of america in which kkr participated though the rjr deal was larger adjusted for inflation however adjusted for inflation none of the leveraged buyouts of the – period would surpass rjr nabisco the rjr transaction benefited many of the parties involved investment bankers and

early s the aftermath of rjr nabiscoedit kkrs headquarters in the solow building at  west th street in new york city the buyout of rjr nabisco was completed in april  and kkr would spend the early s repaying the rjrs enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions after the rjr nabisco deal kkr did not complete a single investment in  the first such year since  they would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of drexel burnham lambert

bondholders kkrs equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of rjr had been only  billion in middecember  rjr announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in rjr for a new public stock in the company effectively an unusual means of taking rjr public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company rjr issued additional stock to the public in march  to further reduce debt

leveraged buyout of borden inc a producer of food and beverage products consumer products and industrial products in an unprecedented and complex transaction  the following year in  kkr would divest itself of its final stake in rjr nabisco when borden sold a  million block of stock while kkr no longer had any ownership of rjr nabisco by  its original investment would not be fully realized until kkr exited its last investment in  after sixteen years of efforts including contributing new equity taking rjr public asset sales and exchanging shares of rjr for the ownership of borden inc kkr finally sold the last remnants of its  investment in july  kkr agreed to sell its stock in borden chemical to apollo management for  billion early s investmentsedit in the early s the absence of an active high yield market prompted kkr to change its tactics avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups one of kkrs largest investments in the s was the leveraged buildup of primedia in partnership with former executives of macmillan publishing which kkr had failed to acquire in  kkr created primedias

continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo henry r kravis right and george r roberts in  the two men have announced their potential successors few can claim as crucial a role in creating the buyout industry as henry r kravis and george r roberts from a small partnership that began with just  the two created the colossus now known as kohlberg kravis roberts the firm that bought rjr nabisco and defined an eranow more than  years after setting up kkr the two billionaire cousins have finally outlined the future of a firm where the k the k and the r are all gonein naming joseph y bae and scott c nuttall as kkr’s copresidents and cochief operating officers on monday mr kravis and mr roberts unveiled one of the clearest lines of succession in the private equity industryit is a rare move in an industry where many of the iconic figures — stephen a schwarzman of the blackstone group and david rubenstein of the carlyle group among them — continue to drum up deals and raise billions of dollars from investors advertisement continue reading the main story the appointments will charge mr nuttall  and mr bae  with running kkr a  billion firm on a daytoday basis continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story “today’s announcement is about the future and ensuring we have the right team and leadership structure to serve our clients and partners for decades to come” mr kravis and mr roberts said in a statementwhile mr kravis and mr roberts are preparing for the day they step away from the business it is not clear when that will be mr kravis and mr roberts both  will remain cochairmen and cochief executivesjerome kohlberg jr their fellow founder quit in  amid disagreements over strategy and started his own investment firm he died in blackstone has long had an heir apparent in its real estate chief jonathan d gray a lifer at the investment giant yet mr schwarzman has also shown little inclination to retire soonamong the other private equity giants tpg capital added a former goldman sachs executive jon winkelried as a cochief executive two years ago while the cofounder david bonderman became chairman and warburg pincus long ago named joseph p landy and charles r kaye as its chief executives with them taking over from the cofounders lionel i pincus and john vogelstein“succession planning is something that a number of the public alternative asset managers will have to increasingly think about as each still has founders actively involved” analysts at jmp securities wrote in a research note on mondaypreparing for a succession is not always easy however the carlyle group a private equity titan hired adena t friedman from nasdaq as its chief financial officer in  setting off speculation that she would one day lead the company but she left three years later to return to nasdaq where she became chief executive in november advertisement continue reading the main story the carlyle group hired michael cavanagh a muchlauded executive at jpmorgan chase in  but he left the firm for comcast a year latertoday carlyle has a single president and chief operating officer glenn youngkin although it has younger executives like kewsong lee and peter clare who could be promotedthe anointment of potential successors to mr kravis and mr roberts is perhaps more notable than it

“barbarians at the gate” since then the private equity industry has largely shed its reputation as being made up of uncouth raiders and become enormous with some  billion in uninvested capital as of dec  according to preqinand it has made these firms’ founders billionaires several times over forbes estimates the net worths of mr kravis and mr roberts at  billion eachin recent years the two have praised the firm’s growing bench with mr kravis once saying that any of  executives could lead the firm should he and his cousin retireamong those individuals were mr nuttall and mr bae both of whom joined the firm in now they will oversee kkr splitting the responsibilities mr bae who joined the firm from goldman sachs will take over the private equity business and the asset management operations that touch energy infrastructure and real estate among his signature achievements was building the firm’s asian operationsand mr nuttall who was previously at blackstone will handle kkr’s debt investing hedge funds and growing capital markets unit as well as corporate development and initiatives for expanding the firm he has already become a familiar face on wall street having spoken often on the firm’s earnings calls with analysts and helped shepherd the firm onto the public stock markets“they think and act globally they embody kkr’s core values and they are two of our most accomplished business leaders with proven track records of managing large teams building new businesses and driving value for our fund investors and our public unit holders” mr kravis and mr roberts said of mr bae and mr nuttall advertisement continue reading the main story the two copresidents will also join the boardmr bae and mr nuttall will manage a firm that is more diverse than when it began with the private equity industry continuing to evolve and growalthough such firms remain tied in the popular imagination to leveraged buyouts like the rjr nabisco takeover the industry long ago extended into a much wider array of businesses much of that has been driven by a desire to expand the total number of assets the firms oversee allowing them to collect a steady stream of management fees that wall street investors likethat is one reason that less than a third of blackstone’s  billion in assets last year was held by its private equity portfolio while the firm has become the biggest private landlord in the united states kkr has pushed heavily into debttrading businesses and capital markets underwritingamong the four private equity titans that are publicly listed — kkr blackstone carlyle and apollo global management — kkr’s share price has performed the second best climbing almost  percent in the last  monthsas mr bae and mr nuttall rise one of their colleagues will leave alex navab the head of the firm’s americas private equity practice and one of its most senior deal makers will depart shortly after helping the firm raise  billion for its newest north american buyout fundmr navab is expected to eventually seek a job running a business“alex has been an outstanding investor and a remarkable leader of our flagship americas private equity business over the last decade” mr kravis and mr roberts saidalso leaving at the end of the year is todd fisher the chief administrative officer the firm said that his departure was unrelated to the changes at the top and

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

giving back is something that comes from the heart to me its not that i do it because its the right thing i do it because i want do it henry kravis heart giving want its one of the most important things at the end of the day being able to say no to an investment henry kravis day end end of the day you only have one thing to sell in life and thats yourself henry kravis life yourself you i was an economics major in college and every summer after school i would drive my car from california from claremont mens college at the time to new york and i worked on wall street henry kravis summer time car look dont congratulate us when we buy a company congratulate us when we sell it because any fool can overpay and buy a company as long as money will last to buy it henry kravis money fool long i thought at the time that i wanted to go into institutional sales selling stocks and bonds to institutions in those days which was the s the institutional salesman was making about  a year i thought that was just an enormous amount of money henry kravis time money sales one i love the creativity i love the ability to create a capital structure that is appropriate for a company no matter what field it happens to be in henry kravis love creativity matter as i said there is nothing wrong with failing pick yourself up and try it again you never are going to know how good you really are until you go out and face failure henry kravis failure good yourself ive been in a hurry all my life ive been in a hurry to succeed and in a hurry to prove myself henry kravis life myself my life if you dont have integrity you have nothing you cant buy it you can have all the money in the world but if you are not a moral and ethical person you really have nothing henry kravis money integrity world if you have something at risk you think differently henry kravis risk think you if you build that foundation both the moral and the ethical foundation as well as the business foundation and the experience foundation then the building wont crumble henry kravis business experience the trouble in my opinion with corporate america today is that everything is thought of in quarters henry kravis today america thought but once you buy a company you are married you are married to that company henry kravis you company married its not just buying the company sure we picked the right companies and we picked the right management and most importantly weve given them the right incentive to perform henry kravis management company buying i always like to refer managers in corporate america as the renters of the corporate assets not the owners henry kravis america assets always so i picked a field where i had a little exposure where i thought i could have an enormous challenge and have a chance to really do some good to be a pioneer in an area and not just be like everyone else henry kravis good challenge chance i have in my partner george roberts a person who is the most wonderful man in the world to me hes like a brother to me creating with him being side by side with him in whatever we try to do is a real pleasure to me henry kravis man brother world i want people who will stand up to me people who are not afraid to say exactly whats on their minds even though thats probably not what i want to hear thats what i want henry kravis people want me in the s and s what private equity did is it changed corporate america it started holding companies accountable and for the first time managers started thinking like owners henry kravis time thinking america i love the ability to work with very good managers and to provide the right incentives for them and truly become a partner with that management and make that management take a long view henry kravis love work good if we can just take a few companies and use those as models as examples to show the rest of corporate america how they can become more competitive thats what id like to do and thats what i hope to do henry kravis hope america rest it used to be that you would go in to see a ceo and you would ask them is your company for sale and if they said no we have no interest in selling that was sort of the end of the conversation henry kravis end conversation you quite frankly the financial community has to improve its image the financial community has to be much more transparent than it is henry kravis
