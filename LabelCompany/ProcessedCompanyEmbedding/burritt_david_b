provisional patent application serial no  filed sep  technical field  the present invention relates generally to a method of managing a project and more particularly to a method of managing a project associated with process improvement background  many corporations are implementing continuous improvement programs in an effort to improve the processes of the corporation these process improvements are intended to ultimately help achieve the corporate objectives and goals by their very nature the processes that are implemented under these programs introduce change to the corporation process change within a corporation may also introduce risk into the corporation while not all risk is inherently bad assuming risk without understanding the significance of the risk or being aware of the presence of the risk at all may lead to poor business decisions that is the processes introduced to help achieve corporate goals may be the very processes that prevent the accomplishment of the goals if the associated risks are not understood  in addition some corporations adopt a continuous improvement technique throughout the company on a whole scale basis ie as a company wide initiative this leads to concurrent improvement teams and a significant cultural shift in the company these changes in culture and inherent changes in processes lead to the introduction of risk that may not have been previously present again if a company is unaware of these risks or their significance then the desired improvements may not be realized  the present invention is directed to overcome one or more of the problems set forth above summary of the invention  in one aspect of the present invention a method of managing a project associated with process improvement is disclosed the method includes the steps of establishing a plurality of processes of an organization evaluating a risk to the processes due to the project and managing the project in response to the evaluation  in another aspect of the present invention a method of managing a project associated with process improvement is disclosed the method includes the steps of establishing a plurality of customer requirements establishing a plurality of business objectives establishing a business risk associated with the project and managing the project in response to the customer requirements the business objectives and the business riskbrief description of the drawings  fig  is an illustration of one embodiment of a method of managing a project associated with process improvement and  fig  is an illustration of one embodiment of a risk mapdetailed description  the present disclosure is associated with a method of managing a project associated with process improvement there are many types of process improvement methods such as continuous quality improvement business process reengineering value based management total quality improvement or management and  sigma an organization may determine to perform one or more projects utilizing one of the above process improvement methods in an effort to enhance their ability to achieve their business objectivesgoals an organization may be described as a business entity corporation company or portion thereof eg department etc the project to be managed may be a new process being proposed a new process slated for implementation or an existing process being reviewed for modification  fig  illustrates one embodiment of a method of managing a project associated with process improvement in a first control block  the processes of an organization are established the processes may be general processes or the key processes or key business activities of the organization key processes are major business processes and activities that the organization undertakes to ensure achievement of the organizations objectives examples of key processes or key business activities include social responsibility corporate governance strategic business planning product andor service development sales capabilitycustomer relationship management order fulfillment product and service support information management financial products accounting and reporting human resources and treasury key processes may vary from one organization to another the key processes of the organization may have been previously established for example the key processes of a company may be established by top managers of a company and passed downward to other process layers andor functional areas eg departments within the company alternatively the key processes may be established by the department managing the project independent of key processes in other departments in one embodiment the key processes identified at an upper tier of an organization may be passed down and used as a baseline for key processes of the lower tier the baseline key processes may then be customized by the lower tier to reflect the goalsobjectives of the lower tier the customized processes may include subprocesses or interrelated processes of the key process  in a second control block  the risks to the established processes due to the project are evaluated when a new project is created or an existing project is modified there is a change in the environment the project is established in there are risks associated with this project regarding how the change will affect the organizations other processes such as the key processes in addition there may be other processes which support or relate to a particular key process eg a subprocess or an interrelated process and that are affected by the proposed project therefore the risk to the established processes such as the key process andor associated subprocesses and interrelated processes may be evaluated in light of the project subprocesses and interrelated processes may also be referred to as supporting processes a risk evaluation may include the identification of risk associated with a process eg a key process andor supporting process and the assessment of risk associated with a process due to the proposed project risk identification is the process of identifying the risk associated with a process due to the project the specific risk identification process used is implementation dependent and will be discussed below  a risk assessment may include establishing a risk value or score indicative of the assessed risk to the key processes or associated supporting processes due to the project for example a value range may be established between  and  with  being indicative of the most risk and  being indicative of the least risk if the project will introduce unacceptable risk in the key process or one or more of the supporting processes then it may be assigned a value of  if the project will have a significant impact on the key process or most of the supporting processes it may be assigned a value of  if the project will have a moderate impact on some of the key process or one or more supporting processes then it may be assigned a value of  if the risks resulting from the project will have no or little impact on the key processes or the supporting processes then the value may be  the assignment of the risk values may be made by the project participants in one embodiment the participants make an estimate of the risk value the value estimate may be performed without a specific risk identification process that is the risk value estimate may be an estimate of a perceived risk in another embodiment the project participants may vote on the significance of the risk and likelihood of the risk to occur the voting may result in values eg  being assigned to the significance and likelihood of the risk as illustrated in fig  an illustration of a risk map from these values a risk value may be established for example a risk value may be a weighted combination of the significance and likelihood of the risk  in one embodiment the risk value may be determined based on an inherent risk value and a residual risk value an inherent risk value is an assessment of the risk associated with the key business process without considering existing activities or processes to minimize or mitigate the risk the residual risk is the exposure to uncertainty remaining after considering current risk management activities or processes intended to mitigate or minimize the risk the inherent risk value and residual risk value may be established by the project participants andor through a selfassessment performed by the organization engaged in the project a selfassessment is a process where the organization performs a risk review to identify and assess the risk associated with a process there may be an inherent risk and residual risk associated with each of the key processes andor the associated supporting processes the inherent and residual values may be based on the significance and likelihood of the risk the inherent risk value and residual risk value may then be compared to determine an assessed risk to each of the key processes of the organization due to the project and therefore the assessed risk to the organization due to the project for example using a scale of  with  being low risk and  being high risk if a risk associated with a key process has an inherent risk of  and a residual risk of  the assessed risk may be high there is a large inherent risk associated with the key business activity and there is very little done or done effectively to mitigate the risk therefore there is a high risk if the inherent risk is  and the residual risk is  the assessed risk may be low there is a large inherent risk associated with the key business activity but the organization is effective at managing the risk therefore the assessed risk is low the inherent residual or assessed risk may form the basis for the risk values of the key processes impacted by the project  in one embodiment a risk value is associated with each of the established processes eg key processes or associated subprocesses or interrelated processes then a composite risk of the project on the key processes may be established in response to the risk values the composite risk value may be established by adding each of the risk values together the composite risk may then be used in part to manage the project as will be discussed  in one embodiment a subset of the established processes is used to establish a composite value the processes most impacted by the project may be identified and the associated risk values used to determine the composite risk of the project for example a risk value may be established for each key process or subprocess andor interrelated process then the lowest four risk values for example may be used to establish the composite risk value  in one embodiment the risk assessment may be performed by utilizing multiple composite scores that is a composite score may be established using the risk values of the established processes most impacted by the project as described above in addition a composite score may be established using the risk values of all of the established processes as described above using both composite scores enables the assessment to identify if there are processes that will be significantly impacted by the project and the overall risk to the process from the project  in one embodiment as mentioned above the key processes may have associated subprocesses or interrelated processes the supporting processes may be assessed with respect to risk for example a risk value may be determined and associated with each supporting process the risk values of the supporting processes may be utilized to establish a composite value associated with the key process the composite value of the supporting processes may be established in one of the embodiments described above the risk value of the key process may be established at least in part based upon the composite risk value of the supporting processes  in a third control block  once the project risk has been evaluated the project may be managed in response to the evaluation project management may include using the evaluation to perform project selection team selection for the project determine the frequency of risk evaluations andor establish the level of integration with the continuous improvement process  the risk values determined during the assessment may be used to guide project management as discussed the risk values associated with the processes may be added together to establish the composite value in one embodiment a composite value indicating a high risk ie that the project may have a significant impact andor likelihood of occurring on the processes may be used to determine that the project should either not be implemented or should utilize extensive risk management techniques throughout all steps of the project development implementation deployment and monitoring in order to manage the risk a moderate composite risk value indicates that the project has a moderate impact on the processes and therefore should utilize risk management during the initial steps of the project such as identification of customer requirements and at specified checkpoints throughout the project a composite value indicating a low risk ie the project has a minimal impact on the processes may be used to determine that the project should utilize risk management during identification of the critical customer requirements and review of the process decision  project management may include deciding whether to begin the project therefore if the project has not begun the risk assessment may be used to determine whether the project should proceed if the risk assessment indicates that this project introduces too much risk to other processes eg based on the composite value the project may be terminated before it is begun alternatively aspects of the project may be identified through the risk evaluation which if modified would reduce the risk to existing processes  the project may be managed by using the results of the risk assessment to select team members for the project or to select a review team for example if there is a high risk of a process due to the proposed project a subject matter expert associated with the effected process may be identified and consulted with the subject matter expert may become part of the project team or part of a review team the activities of the subject matter expert may include a further assessment of the risk to the effected process to verify the initial risk assessment if there was one in addition the subject matter expert may identify potential risk mitigation processes the subject matter expert may be involved throughout the phases of the proposed project to continue to assess the risk to the effected process and identify and assess potential mitigation activities  managing a project may include determining the timingfrequency of the risk evaluations that is the timing of the risk evaluation may vary a risk assessment may be performed prior to beginning a project in addition subsequent risk assessments may be performed throughout the development implementation and deployment of a project in one embodiment the frequency of the risk assessments may be determined in response to the composite value of one or more assessments for example a decision to perform less frequent risk assessments may be made in response to the initial risk assessment indicating there is a low risk associated with the proposed project if the first risk assessment indicates that there is a high risk to existing processes based on the project then there may be a determination to perform risk assessments throughout the life of the project in an effort to monitor control and mitigate the impact of the project on existing processes if subsequent composite risk values indicate the risk is not as significant as previously assessed then the frequency of the risk assessments may be reduced in addition if subsequent composite risk values indicate the risk is more significant than previously assessed then the frequency of the risk assessments may be increased andor additional risk mitigation processes pursued  the risk evaluation may be used to determine to what extent mitigation processes need to be pursued in one embodiment a composite risk value indicating a high risk may be used to determine that additional efforts should be made to mitigate the risk for example a review of possible processes that may be used to mitigate the risk of the project and in particular the risk to the process due to the project may be reviewed one or more mitigation processes may be selected for implementation in order to reduce the residual risk of the project for example one mitigation process may be the procurement of insurance if available the degree of risk introduced may help determine the amount of insurance purchased  risk assessments may be performed on projects that are already underway eg that are being deployed the purpose is to identify risk as soon as possible even if the project is underway or completed in an effort to reduce the impact to the organization eg increase the likelihood of success of the project etc  the project may be managed by using the risk evaluation to manage the level of integration there is between risk management and the continuous improvement process for example the higher the risk the more frequently the risk evaluations may be performed during project implementation therefore an integrated method of managing a project associated with process improvement may include the steps of establishing a plurality of customer requirements establishing a plurality of business objectives establishing a business risk associated with the project and managing said project in response to the customer requirements the business objectives and the business risk  once a project has been selected for evaluation andor implementation eg a recognized need exists and the project proposes to identify and implement a solution to the need the customer requirements associated with the project may be established the customer requirements may include performance standards and requirement statements in one embodiment customer requirements are obtained by identifying a problem to be solved the need then the customer associated with the problem may be identified coordination with the customer then leads to the identification of customer criteria or requirements customer coordination may include an interview with the customers to determine whether current processes meet the customer requirements if the current processes dont meet customer requirements then a determination is made as to where they fall short other forms of customer coordination include surveys and small group meetings the particular technique used to gather customer requirements is implementation dependent the customer requirements may be prioritized and evaluated with regard to a business strategy  the business objectives associated with the project may be established in one embodiment the business objectives may be established by correlating the key business activities or processes of the organization with the particular project that is the key processes that are affected by the project being considered or problem being considered may be determined these identified key processes may be considered the business objectives of the project in addition coordination with the customer may further establish the business objectives the customers may be associated with different processesfunctions of the organization therefore the customers may have additional business objectives associated with the project or provide additional information on how the project impacts other key processes  the business risk associated with the project may be established the business risk may be established as described above during the risk evaluation for example the risk may be established based upon establishing a risk value associated with the processes impacted by the proposed project and developing a composite risk value in response to the risk values  the project may then be managed in response to the customer requirements business objectives and business risk associated with the project as mentioned the project may be managed by determining how often to perform risk evaluations in addition the risk evaluation eg composite values may be used to determine what if any controls or risk management processes should be put into place a high risk may indicate that significant effort should be placed in identifying assessing and implementing risk mitigation processes  project management may include assessing the riskbenefit of a project or proposed mitigation process and managing it accordingly the risk and benefit of the project may be balanced that is an assessment of whether the cost risk of the project or associated mitigation process is worth the potential benefit in addition the riskbenefit analysis may provide guidance on which risk mitigation processes should be implemented if multiple risk mitigation processes are available they may each be reviewed to determine the associated cost and benefit therefore an informed decision may be made regarding which risk mitigation processes should be implemented for example if the risk of the project is that  will be lost in inventory the risk mitigation process to reduce the risk of lost inventory should not itself cost  to implement  in addition as mentioned managing the risk may include using the assessed risk to determine how frequently to perform a risk review eg how thoroughly to integrate risk management with the continuous improvement process for example if the continuous improvement process associated with the process is  sigma then the project may be managed by integrating the risk management process into one or more phases of the dmaic define measure analyze improve and control process or the dmedi define measure explore develop and implement process  the define phase of the dmaic process includes defining the customers and their requirements and mapping the process to be improved during the define phase risk management issues such as the commitment to assess and manage risk may be included in the problem statement and accounted for in the process mapping  the risk evaluation process may also be utilized during the measure analyze improve and control phases of the dmaic process the measure phase includes the identification of existing process and performance standards the collection of data on the process determination of the processs baseline performance and setting the improvement goal for the project in one embodiment a risk identification and assessment may be performed during the measure phase to understand what risk may be associated with the current process and what is the significance and likelihood of the risk the inherent risk and residual risk of the process this may be viewed as a baseline risk assessment the manner in which a baseline risk assessment may be used is discussed below  the analyze phase of the dmaic process includes the identification of key sources of variation associated with the current and proposed processes by analyzing the data and processes in addition the financial opportunity of the process may be quantified the baseline risk assessment established during the measure phase may be used as potential solutions are posed in order to compare the risk of the current process with the risk of the proposed projectprocess an increased risk associated with a proposed process is not inherently bad if there are appropriate risk mitigation processes available or if the benefit associated with the proposed process warrants the risk however having the baseline risk assessment enables these considerations to be analyzed and accounted for  the improve phase of the dmaic process includes the generation and testing of possible solutions leading to the selection of the best solution eg process modification or creation to address important sources of variation in addition the required resources are identified and the implementation plans are developed performing risk evaluation during this phase enables the identification and assessment of risk associated with the new process or the update of the risk assessment if it was performed earlier this evaluation enables an assessment of the risk of the possible solutions and a comparison of the risk with each other and with the baseline risk assessment therefore there is an understanding of what the risks are what the significance and likelihood of the risks are and how the risks may be managed with regard to the potential solutions and the solution ultimately selected in addition the risk assessment enables plans to be generated on how to further manage the risks  the control phase includes implementing the proposed project or project improvement and implementing a plan for sustaining the improvement risk management assessments may be used during this phase to monitor the risk associated with the new process the risk assessment may be performed to see if the risks were expanding and contracting the assessment will enable the assessment of risk mitigation processes for example if one mitigation process is turning out to be ineffective an alternative mitigation process may be pursued in addition risk may be greater than anticipated in some areas thereby warranting additional mitigation processes etc analogous risk management activities may be used with the dmedi define measure explore develop and implement phases of  sigma  as mentioned the risk evaluation may include the process of risk identification the process of identifying risk may be performed in several ways in one embodiment risk identification involves the team associated with the project using their judgment to determine which key processes may be impacted by the project and then determining an associated risk value for each of the key processes during the risk assessment alternatively the team may identify the potential for the project to effect a key process subprocess or interrelated process and then identify a subject matter expert associated with the effected process the subject matter expert may then perform a further review and establish a risk value  in one embodiment risk identification may be performed by comparing the proposed processproject with previously reviewed processes for example a repository of processesprojects associated with risk evaluations may be maintained therefore the currently proposed project may be compared with the repository to determine if there have been any similaranalogous projectsprocesses evaluated or reviewed if there have been then the risk identified with the reviewed process may be considered to determine if they are also risks for the proposed process in this manner previous risk evaluations may be used to provide guidance on what risk may be applicable to the proposed process what key processes subprocess or interrelated processes may be effected by the risk and to what degree eg significance and likelihood and what are potential mitigation processes while risk evaluations including the risk process impact and mitigation processes of a project vary from one proposed project to another the findings of the risk evaluations may be applicable for similaranalogous processesprojects and therefore beneficial to review  in one embodiment the repository of process reviews may be maintained in a project tracking or cataloguing system a tracking system may contain all of the continuous improvement projects regardless of the stage of the project the tracking system may enable the categorizing of projects by key process areas for example a project associated with inventory management may be located under a category of order fulfillment cataloguing projects by key processes may enhance the ability to quickly identify analogous projects and leverage the risk evaluations performed for the analogous projects in addition using key processes to catalogue continuous improvement projects creates a common unifying framework for the company that is the key processes have been identified that relate directly to the organizations business objectives and goals using these key processes to catalogue continuous improvement projects helps ensure that proposed projects are directed towards the areas the organization has deemed key for success therefore if resources are limited the activities may be focused in the areas deemed most important in addition the manager of the continuous improvement process may be on an organizations risk management committee or vice versa to further ensure the integration of risk management and continuous improvement projects in one embodiment the project tracking system may be searched based on one or more of project key process risk or risk type and mitigation processes  in one embodiment the risk identification process may include a formal risk identification phase for example a risk management team may engage in interviews with the identified participants of the organization to identify the risk the interviews are conducted to identify the risk that may be associated with the project being reviewed for example risks which cause variability in the processes associated with the project may be identified in one embodiment only one individual is met with at a time in this manner an individuals opinions regarding the risk associated with the process may be more forthcoming in addition the interview results associated with the individual are recorded anonymously again to encourage more forthcoming responses in one embodiment interview comments are correlated with risk types during or immediately following the interview to facilitate rapid identification of applicable risks risk types are baseline types of risks that may impact the company andor the organization generally only a subset of the risk types will be applicable to any particular process the applicable risk types are determined on a process by process basis in one embodiment the baseline risk types may be determined by an upper tier of the company and passed downwards in one embodiment if the baseline list of risks is not comprehensive risks other than the baseline risk types may be identified as potentially applicable to the process therefore the interview comments may be correlated with the risk types during the interview to facilitate rapid identification of applicable risks while the interview format is implementation dependent the interview may begin with an initial discussion of the project or process and the interviewees role in the project the initial discussions may be followed by detailed questions regarding the risk the individual believes to be associated with the project why the individual believes these to be risk associated with the project what the significance of the risk is what priority the individual assesses to the risk and other types of followup questions in one embodiment the root cause perceived or otherwise of the risk may be discussed that is issues such as why the risk exists what causes the risk to exist what factors contribute to changes in the risk etc may be discussed in one embodiment the interviewer may also identify any known processes that may be used to mitigate the identified risk the effectiveness of the mitigation processes and the maturity of the mitigation processes  other aspects objects and advantages of the present invention can be obtained from a study of the drawings the disclosure and the claims industrial applicability  the present disclosure is associated with a method of managing a process associated with continuous improvement in one embodiment the method includes the steps of establishing multiple processes of an organization evaluating a risk to the processes due to the project and managing the project in response to the evaluation an example of a proposed project may include a new purchasing system associated with inventory management in one embodiment the project may have begun by identifying a problem associated with the purchasing process for example payments associated with invoices are repeatedly late payment amounts are in error and sometimes go to the wrong company therefore there is a need to improve the purchasing process the proposed purchasing system may be one of the results of the investigation into the need to improve the purchasing process eg the identification of customer requirements and associated business objectives  the process eg key or supporting process of the organization may be established for the sake of this example assume an upper tier of the organization has established the key processes and distributed them throughout the company the key processes established may include social responsibility corporate governance strategic business planning product andor service development sales capabilitycustomer relationship management order fulfillment product and service support information management financial products accounting and reporting human resources and treasury  the risk associated with the key processes due to the proposed project may be evaluated for example a risk value may be established to reflect the risk of the project to the process the risk values may range from  with  being indicative of the most risk and  being indicative of the least risk the evaluation may result in the following assessment process impactprocessrisk valuesocial responsibilitycorporate governancestrategic business planningproduct andor service developmentan ineffective purchasing process may impactthe selling of inventory management servicessales capabilitycustomer relationship managementorder fulfillmentpurchasing is a significant aspect of orderfulfillmentan ineffective purchasing process willsignificantly impact customer relationshipsproduct and service supportinformation managementfinancial productsaccounting and reportinginadequate record keeping will adverselyimpact accounting and reportinghuman resourcestreasurylate payments and finance charges impact cash  adding the risk values together results in an overall composite value of  out of  with an average risk value of  the overall composite score indicates that the proposed process will have some impact on some of the processes therefore additional risk management steps should be implemented eg have additional risk assessments at the beginning and ending phase of the dmedidmaic process however the focused composite value as determined by adding the four lowest risk values together is  with an average risk value of  based on a composite threshold of  indicating high risk  indicating moderate risk and  indicating low risk this particular proposed project poses a high risk to the key processes or at least a significant portion of them therefore despite the moderate to low risk indicated by the overall composite value the process should be deemed to pose high risk based on the focused composite value accordingly several actions may be taken to manage the project these actions may be done concurrently or sequentially in one embodiment a decision regarding whether to proceed any further with the project may be made it may be determined that the assessed risk is larger than desired and therefore the project will not proceed the assessed risk may be based on the focused composite value average focused risk values the overall composite values the overall risk values or some combination thereof a riskbenefit analysis may be performed to assist in determining whether to proceed for example a detailed analysis of the risk to sales capabilitycustomer relationship management order fulfillment product and service support accounting and reporting and treasury may be performed if it hasnt been already along with a detailed analysis of the benefits of the proposed process then a riskbenefit analysis may be performed to determine the acceptable amount of risk to be assumed in light of the associated benefits if the benefits of the proposed purchasing system do not offset the assessed risk or cost then the project may be cancelled  subject matter experts may be identified in each of the areas perceived to be significantly impacted eg sales capabilitycustomer relationship management order fulfillment accounting and reporting and treasury these subject matter experts may be included on the team if they havent been already or may simply perform an oversightconsulting role for the team the subject matter expert may perform a more indepth assessment of the risk to the process in addition to identifying a subject matter expert risk mitigation processes may be identified and assessed to try and offset the assessed risk for example the risk mitigation processes may include operating the existing purchasing process in parallel with a proposed process before pulling the current process offline and exercising the proposed process with purchasing data before activating the process  if the project is to proceed then the frequency of risk reviews may be determined based on the risk assessment eg utilizing focused composite values in this case with a high risk assessment plans may be made to review the risk at each of the phases of the continuous improvement process eg dmaic or dmedi phases in the case of  sigma in this manner additional scrutiny may be provided to proposed projects that have high risk assessments therefore the assessed risk may be reduced or at least controlled and balanced with the anticipated benefits of the process
