wls license if we plan to go for we have license for ias steven chan tuesday october   hello guestif you have purchased an ias ee licence you do not need to purchase any additional licences when upgrading to ebs regardssteven santiago bastidas wednesday november   hello rochakyou are correct noneditioned objects cannot reference editioned objects in r when a column is added to a table via a patch the editioning view projecting the relevant columns in the table is updated adding the new column this change in the editioning view is isolated to the patch edition hence only visible to that editionr as you mentioned requires double the amount of space but only on the file system on the database side thanks to ebr we perform a smart copy of the objects only the objects patched are copied cleanup removes objects that have been replaced with new versions in the last patching cycle we have not observed a significant performance degradation related to fragmentation on the system tablespace but we do recommend that you perform an actualizeall operation periodically in order to keep the amount of editions low please review the oracle ebusiness suite r maintenance guide to learn more about the actualizeall operationall patches in r are designed to work online in environments that do not require x availability you could apply your patches with the system offline that will free up resources you could take advantage of those resources by allocating more workers during the execution of the apply phasethe editioning operation comprises several dml operations that surely will be captured by the archive logging infrastructure in the database the same applies to cleanup operationsregardssantiago omar halaseh tuesday november   dear stevenhope all is welli just want to make sure what to recommend to new customers should we recommend  or  looking at oow presentation oracle seems to be shy about it with their recommendationschoose  if you– need the high availability provided by online patching– want the functional enhancements that are in – prefer to invest in a single project to upgrade directly to choose  if you– prefer to target a release with thousands of live customers– would like to stay on  for  years before upgrading to – need to move from a release below  with no direct upgrade to if you give this recommendation to new customers they will be nervous about  and will lean more towards  which has wider customer basewhat do you recommend for new customersbest regardsomar halaseh steven chan tuesday november   hi omarits really up to customers to decide which

see coherence bringing better caching and thereby better performance experience to the applicationthankstom steven chan monday december   hi espenif youre on a bit platform that doesnt have an

always your blogs and post make a good reading thanks my client has been informed by someone that western european characterset weisop is not supported in fresh implementations of  or  upgraded from ii read thru the install notes release notes rapid install guide and nls release notes for  but did not come across such mandate can you please confirm and many thanks in advance guest thursday january   weisop as well as other nativelegacy character sets are still supported in ebusiness suite release  for both fresh install and upgradesmy advice however is to carefully consider your options herea what set of languages does your client support todayb what set of languages does your client plan to support in the near and long termin general i strongly recommend customers to start fresh implementations with unicode alutf character set as its a universal character set which supports all live languages all new software only supports it such as oracle fusion apps and it simplifies interoperability with other softwareweisop character set does not support the euro symbol so instead i would suggest weisop if your client plans to support some of the western european languagesbear in mind that character set migration is a big project that entails data cleansing and remedying character expansion issues etc its important to carefully consider all of the above at implementation upgrade times guest tuesday january   hi stevengood morningwe are upgrading our instance from i to  we have a sev sr with oracle support where we have a requirement of migrating services from one node to another node and the options we getting from them  you cant move services and we need to redo entire process right from ri till upgrade which no customer agrees clone it to a new instance by changing the sid and self clone is not supported which is a very painful processthe answer we are receiving for self clone not supported is as its not mentioned in any document its not supported we actually dont know the difference between self cloning and actual cloning when the cleanup procedure is same for the both the processes support again says that self clone is supported for i and  as they tested itby the way we tried doing self clone and it failed with one run of preclone and successful with an earlier run of preclone i feel this is a bug but i doubt support helps us saying this is not a bug as the procedure itself is not supported as they confirmed with developmentwe actually dont know how does changing the database sid changes the procedure guest tuesday january   hi stevenalso its getting a bit hard to get right help from support on  weblogic and cloning stuff why i say this for simple cloning process they are asking us to do the entire upgrade process again right from ri they say cloning to new sid and new host is supported but not on the same hostself clone just bcz as they dont know whether they tested but that is not correct as far as i know moreover they say that development told them about this steven chan tuesday january   hello guestim sorry to hear that youve encountered an issue with thiswe can provide general conceptual guidance here but im

activated that environment will be ultimately cloned afterwards however to my big surprise the ebs  setup guide clearly says that cloning a racenabled system is not certified with rapid clone advanced cloning options  option is there another workaround to clone the database tier at this time since most of the ebs production environments are racbased most of the mos notes refer to  version not  does that mean a current ebs  racbased production is not clonable with rapid clonecheersoumar brian tuesday february   hi steven we are currently in the process of upgrading an oracle ebs instance from i to  once upgraded we plan to run the r readiness reports couple of questions  does this process validate and try to remedy custom forms and reports since these are binary objects was not sure how they would be handled  we ran a preliminary readiness report prior to upgrading and found they have many db users defined some are for rd party applications but the majority are end users which have access to their own set of viewstables for general queries all of these showed up as invalid schemas and ofcourse are not registered within oracle can these just be ignored in the readiness report assuming the queries used are in compliancethank you max arderius friday february   oumar that is correct rapid clone is currently in the process of being certified with rac in the dbtier you can still use rapid clone to clone the appstier in  the database cloning portion is practically the same so you can clone the database separately ie with rman and use adcfgclone to configure the database oracle

working with satish on this issue ive replied privately via email lets follow up on this offlineregardssteven bala tuesday april   hello steveni have a question regarding dmz setup in  i would like to know that if this is achievable or how this can be achieved the configuration setup is as below  server a is fully configured single node application of  environment we have proposals to installconfigure the new application tier for dmz within the same physical server a but with a vip and a virtual hostname we would like to perform this to avoid the extra licensing cost on having application running on new or other server question is   is this achievable and how  we have followed the dmz setup in  mos document  and typically figure f option  using reverse proxy with no external web tier is our topology appreciate your inputs on this thanksbala jon friday may   bala i am interested in hearing if a single node architecture with the additional dmz application tier will work using vip and virtual host name please let me know if you are able to make this architecture work thanks jon noby joseph friday may   balajonthe configuration you are describing is currently not supported with ebusiness suite   thanksnoby jon friday may   hi noby  steventhank you for the quick response our i to  upgrade is scheduled for july do you have any idea when the reverse proxy topography will be supported we could add the additional server in the interim but this has expensive licensing implications any guidance would be greatly appreciatedjon dmz setup in  mos document

billion dollar companyalso does anyone have a list of bugs for  our consultants are saying that  is relatively unstablethanks puneet friday may   hello stevenit is always useful to read your blogsi need you help to understand something which is very confusing and difficult to decidehow difficult or easy or feasible is it if we have to create some thing in adf which is to be used in ebs  or we are currently on  and some body told out management that adf is good to use for customization with but as per my understanding to implement adf we need infrstructure changesalso i have heard that oracle development is developing some features in adf for  future releases is that correctregardspuneet goyal sara woodhull monday june   hi puneetour first recommendation is always to use oracle application framework oa framework if you are integrating with oracle ebusiness suite this is our primary development platform for ebs and we are actively enhancing it especially in the user interface area we use oa framework for nearly all of our desktop and tablet applicationswe usually recommend other tools only for very specific use cases for example for cases where you have need something specific that only adf has such as the hierarchy view feature you might choose adf in fact the hcm organization chart feature uses the hierarchy viewer in release  hrms rup in a hybrid page oa framework page with an embedded adf region oracle electronic kanban is also built using adf on there is a considerable amount of extra effort required for the integration of adf with the ebs ui if you are using adf as a totally separate application for example using ebs web services on the back end without trying to integrate with the ebs ui or security then you simply have a separate infrastructurefor ebs smart phone applications we are using adf mobile with rest services from ebs that is a special use case for us and it does not require integrating the ui with the ebs desktop ui oa frameworksee the webcasts  training link on the side of this blog for a couple of presentations on the topic  and  however if you are trying to create an extension to ebs that will be used by the same users who use ebs desktop and tablet applications we strongly recommend oa frameworkhope this helpsthankssara steven chan monday june   hello daveyou might find the whitepaper listed here useful if youre deliberating between ebs  vs should you upgrade to ebusiness suite  or  httpsblogsoraclecomstevenchanentryorseveral ebs customers have successfully deployed ebs  in production so far and many
