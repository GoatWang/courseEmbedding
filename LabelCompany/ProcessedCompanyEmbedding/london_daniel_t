what does the future hold for nhtsa by daniel t campbell on march 9  posted in advertising  product risk management events more than two months after president donald trump’s inauguration the automotive industry continues to face substantial uncertainty regarding the direction and priorities of the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa over the next few years for now we can only guess  the new transportation secretary elaine chao was confirmed january   she takes over a nhtsa that had been working hard to keep up with emerging technologies – while acting increasingly muscular in its fines and other punishments under the prior administration for some safety agencies it is much easier to read the tea leaves under the new administration for example at the consumer product safety commission for example we know that there is a new republican acting chair ann marie buerkle and that the five commissioners will remain  in favor of democrats until at least october  when democratic commissioner marietta robinson’s term on the commission expires  see prior article here  and following acting chair buerkle’s public remarks last month at the annual conference of the international consumer product health and safety organization icphso we know that her top three priorities include  collaborating with all product safety stakeholders  taking a balanced and reasonable approach to regulation and  expanding product safety education and awareness for consumers  see prior article here in contrast at nhtsa the top half of the organization chart is largely empty important positions like the administrator deputy administrator and chief counsel remain “vacant”  while executive director jack danielson now serves as the acting deputy administrator these top positions need to be filled which we predict is likely to occur  after the supreme court confirmation process and most likely the tax reform issue  those positions would still need  to be vetted and confirmed in the meantime this creates substantial uncertainty for automobile manufacturers and equipment manufacturers that are regulated by nhtsa   pursuant to nhtsa’s regulations certain decisions and authority are specifically proscribed for some of these vacant positions  from a practical perspective many important agency decisions are likely to be delayed until these positions are filled  for example when a company is required to provide to nhtsa documents or materials that it wants to keep confidential such as sensitive business information at the agency level a determination of confidentiality ultimately rests with the chief counsel  it is unclear in the current state of things how a situation would play out involving a significant or controversial confidentiality request once the vacant positions are filled it is unclear how nhtsa will approach important issues or what will become of nhtsa’s priorities   for example how will the agency under the new administration address autonomous technology issues and development  in a  few public comments secretary chao  has supported the technology and urged industry to step up and educate the public about it while also stating that the new administration is “reevaluating” the guidance that nhtsa issued last september  however many important questions remain similar questions and unknowns swirl around other recent nhtsa priorities such as enforcement and penalties fuel economy and safe driving programs as with the cpsc we can expect the agency to continue pushing safety in those areas where safety has been pushed before  on the other hand in the areas of new and emerging technologies testing methods and data or where states’ rights may intertwine or not with industry interest the future remains to be seen for more discussion about these issues coming out of the trump administration please join us tomorrow march   at  for our webinar the safety agencies in transition – what to expect at fda cpsc
