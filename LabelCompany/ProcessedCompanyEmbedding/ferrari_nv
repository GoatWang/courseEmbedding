a f spider that runs on ethanol was displayed at the  detroit auto show at the  geneva motor show ferrari unveiled a hybrid version of their flagship  called the hykers concept ferraris hybrid system adds more than  horsepower on top of the  fioranos  hp also in mid the flagship laferrari was put into production naming conventionsedit until the early s ferrari followed a threenumber naming scheme based on engine displacement v and v models used the total displacement in decilitres for the first two digits and the number of cylinders as the third thus the  was a  l v powered vehicle while the  used a  l v although for the f the last digit refers to  valves per cylinder upon introduction of the  modena the digits for v models which now carried a name as well as a number refer only to total engine displacement the numerical indication aspect of this name carried on to the f however the fs replacement the  italia uses the same naming as the  and  v models used the displacement in cubic centimetres of one cylinder therefore the famed  daytona had a  cc v however some newer vengined ferraris such as the  have threenumber designations that refer only to total engine displacement flat  boxer models used the displacement in litres for the first digit and the number of cylinders for the next two digits therefore the bb  was five litre flat  a berlinetta boxer in this case however the original berlinetta boxer was the  gt bb which was named in a similar manner to the v models flagship models aka halo cars use the letter f followed by the anniversary in years such as the f and f the enzo skipped this rule although the f name was applied to a ferrari formula one car and is sometimes attached to the enzo some models such as the  mondial and the  testarossa did not follow a threenumber naming scheme  scaglietti sessanta edition most ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style in general the following conventions were used m modificata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor and not a complete evolution see f m and  m maranello gtb gran turismo berlinetta models are closed berlinettas or coupés gts gran turismo spider in older models are open spiders or convertibles see  gts however in more recent models this suffix is used for targa top models see dino  gts and f gts the exception being the  ts which is the only targa named differently the convertible models now use the suffix spider spelt i see f spider and  spider gto gran turismo omologata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor indeed those three letters designate a model which has been designed and improved for racetrack use while still being a streetlegal model only three models bear those three letters the  gto of  the  gto of  and the  gto of  this naming system can be confusing as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style many ferraris also had other names affixed like daytona to identify them further many such names are actually not official factory names the daytona name commemorates ferraris triple success in the february   hours of daytona with the  p only in the  daytona  hours a  gtb model run by nart who raced ferraris in america ran second behind a porsche  the various dino models were named for enzos son dino ferrari and were marketed as dinos by ferrari and sold at ferrari dealers—for all intents and purposes they are ferraris in the mids ferrari added the letter f to the beginning of all models a practice abandoned after the f m and f but adopted again with the f but not with its successor the ferrari   identityedit the cavallino rampante with ferrari lettering ferrari head office and factory count francesco baracca coat of arms of the baracca family the famous symbol of the ferrari race team is the cavallino rampante prancing horse black prancing stallion on a yellow shield usually with the letters s f for scuderia ferrari with three stripes of green white and red the italian national colors at the top the road cars have a rectangular badge on the hood see picture at top of page and optionally the shieldshaped race logo on the sides of both front wings close to the door on  june  enzo ferrari won a race at the savio track in ravenna where he met the countess paolina mother of count francesco baracca an ace of the italian air force and national hero of world war i who used to paint a horse on the side of his planes the countess asked enzo to use this horse on his cars suggesting that it would bring him good luck the original prancing horse on baraccas airplane was painted in red on a white cloudlike shape but ferrari chose to have the horse in black as it had been painted as a sign of grief on baraccas squadron planes after the pilot was killed in action and he added a canary yellow background as this is the color of the city of modena his birthplace the ferrari horse was from the very beginning markedly different from the baracca horse in most details the most noticeable being the tail that in the original baracca version was pointing downward ferrari has used the cavallino rampante on official company stationery since  since the spa  hours of  july  the cavallino rampante has been used on alfa romeos raced by scuderia ferrari the motif of a prancing horse is old it can be found on ancient coins a similar black horse on a yellow shield is the coat of arms of the german city of stuttgart home of mercedesbenz and the design bureau of porsche both being main competitors of alfa and ferrari in the s the citys name derives from stutengarten an ancient form of the german word gestüt which translates into english as stud farm and into italian as scuderia porsche also includes the stuttgart sign in its corporate logo centred in the emblem of the state of württemberg stuttgarts rössle has both rear legs firmly planted on the soil like baraccas horse but unlike ferraris cavallino fabio taglioni used the cavallino rampante on his ducati motorbikes as taglioni was born at lugo di romagna like baracca and his father too was a military pilot during wwi although not part of baraccas squadron as is sometimes mistakenly reported as ferraris fame grew ducati abandoned the horse perhaps the result of a private agreement between the two companies austrian fuel stations the cavallino rampante is the visual symbol of ferrari cavallino magazine uses the name but not the logo other companies use similar logos avanti an austrian company operating over  filling stations uses a prancing horse logo which is nearly identical to ferraris as does iron horse bicycles and norfolk southern railway colouredit main article rosso corsa since the s italian race cars of alfa romeo maserati and later ferrari and abarth were and often still are painted in race red rosso corsa this was the customary national racing color of italy as recommended between the world wars by the organizations that later would become the fia it refers to the nationality of the competing team not that of the car manufacturer or driver in that scheme frenchentered cars such as bugatti were blue german such as auto union and mercedes white since  also bare sheet metal silver and british green such as the mids lotus and brm for instance ferrari won the  world championship with john surtees by competing the last two races in north america with cars painted in the usamerican race colors white and blue as these were not entered by the italian factory themselves but by the usbased north american racing team nart team this was done as a protest concerning arguments between ferrari and the italian racing authorities regarding the homologation of a new midengined ferrari race car corporate affairsedit in  enzo ferrari was approached by the ford motor company about a possible buy out ford audited ferraris assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program henry ford ii consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with lotus lola and cooper to build a car capable of beating ferrari on the world endurance circuit eventually resulting in the production of the ford gt in  as the ford deal fell through fiat approached ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in  enzo ferrari retained a  percent share which is currently owned by his son piero lardi

version of their flagship  called the hykers concept ferraris hybrid system adds more than  horsepower on top of the  fioranos  hp also in mid the flagship laferrari was put into production naming conventionsedit until the early s ferrari followed a threenumber naming scheme based on engine displacement v and v models used the total displacement in decilitres for the first two digits and the number of cylinders as the third thus the  was a  l v powered vehicle while the  used a  l v although for the f the last digit refers to  valves per cylinder upon introduction of the  modena the digits for v models which now carried a name as well as a number refer only to total engine displacement the numerical indication aspect of this name carried on to the f however the fs replacement the  italia uses the same naming as the  and  v models used the displacement in cubic centimetres of one cylinder therefore the famed  daytona had a  cc v however some newer vengined ferraris such as the  have threenumber designations that refer only to total engine displacement flat  boxer models used the displacement in litres for the first digit and the number of cylinders for the next two digits therefore the bb  was five litre flat  a berlinetta boxer in this case however the original berlinetta boxer was the  gt bb which was named in a similar manner to the v models flagship models aka halo cars use the letter f followed by the anniversary in years such as the f and f the enzo skipped this rule although the f name was applied to a ferrari formula one car and is sometimes attached to the enzo some models such as the  mondial and the  testarossa did not follow a threenumber naming scheme  scaglietti sessanta edition most ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style in general the following conventions were used m modificata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor and not a complete evolution see f m and  m maranello gtb gran turismo berlinetta models are closed berlinettas or coupés gts gran turismo spider in older models are open spiders or convertibles see  gts however in more recent models this suffix is used for targa top models see dino  gts and f gts the exception being the  ts which is the only targa named differently the convertible models now use the suffix spider spelt i see f spider and  spider gto gran turismo omologata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor indeed those three letters designate a model which has been designed and improved for racetrack use while still being a streetlegal model only three models bear those three letters the  gto of  the  gto of  and the  gto of  this naming system can be confusing as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style many ferraris also had other names affixed like daytona to identify them further many such names are actually not official factory names the daytona name commemorates ferraris triple success in the february   hours of daytona with the  p only in the  daytona  hours a  gtb model run by nart who raced ferraris in america ran second behind a porsche  the various dino models were named for enzos son dino ferrari and were marketed as dinos by ferrari and sold at ferrari dealers—for all intents and purposes they are ferraris in the mids ferrari added the letter f to the beginning of all models a practice abandoned after the f m and f but adopted again with the f but not with its successor the ferrari   identityedit the cavallino rampante with ferrari lettering ferrari head office and factory count francesco baracca coat of arms of the baracca family the famous symbol of the ferrari race team is the cavallino rampante prancing horse black prancing stallion on a yellow shield usually with the letters s f for scuderia ferrari with three stripes of green white and red the italian national colors at the top the road cars have a rectangular badge on the hood see picture at top of page and optionally the shieldshaped race logo on the sides of both front wings close to the door on  june  enzo ferrari won a race at the savio track in ravenna where he met the countess paolina mother of count francesco baracca an ace of the italian air force and national hero of world war i who used to paint a horse on the side of his planes the countess asked enzo to use this horse on his cars suggesting that it would bring him good luck the original prancing horse on baraccas airplane was painted in red on a white cloudlike shape but ferrari chose to have the horse in black as it had been painted as a sign of grief on baraccas squadron planes after the pilot was killed in action and he added a canary yellow background as this is the color of the city of modena his birthplace the ferrari horse was from the very beginning markedly different from the baracca horse in most details the most noticeable being the tail that in the original baracca version was pointing downward ferrari has used the cavallino rampante on official company stationery since  since the spa  hours of  july  the cavallino rampante has been used on alfa romeos raced by scuderia ferrari the motif of a prancing horse is old it can be found on ancient coins a similar black horse on a yellow shield is the coat of arms of the german city of stuttgart home of mercedesbenz and the design bureau of porsche both being main competitors of alfa and ferrari in the s the citys name derives from stutengarten an ancient form of the german word gestüt which translates into english as stud farm and into italian as scuderia porsche also includes the stuttgart sign in its corporate logo centred in the emblem of the state of württemberg stuttgarts rössle has both rear legs firmly planted on the soil like baraccas horse but unlike ferraris cavallino fabio taglioni used the cavallino rampante on his ducati motorbikes as taglioni was born at lugo di romagna like baracca and his father too was a military pilot during wwi although not part of baraccas squadron as is sometimes mistakenly reported as ferraris fame grew ducati abandoned the horse perhaps the result of a private agreement between the two companies austrian fuel stations the cavallino rampante is the visual symbol of ferrari cavallino magazine uses the name but not the logo other companies use similar logos avanti an austrian company operating over  filling stations uses a prancing horse logo which is nearly identical to ferraris as does iron horse bicycles and norfolk southern railway colouredit main article rosso corsa since the s italian race cars of alfa romeo maserati and later ferrari and abarth were and often still are painted in race red rosso corsa this was the customary national racing color of italy as recommended between the world wars by the organizations that later would become the fia it refers to the nationality of the competing team not that of the car manufacturer or driver in that scheme frenchentered cars such as bugatti were blue german such as auto union and mercedes white since  also bare sheet metal silver and british green such as the mids lotus and brm for instance ferrari won the  world championship with john surtees by competing the last two races in north america with cars painted in the usamerican race colors white and blue as these were not entered by the italian factory themselves but by the usbased north american racing team nart team this was done as a protest concerning arguments between ferrari and the italian racing authorities regarding the homologation of a new midengined ferrari race car corporate affairsedit in  enzo ferrari was approached by the ford motor company about a possible buy out ford audited ferraris assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program henry ford ii consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with lotus lola and cooper to build a car capable of beating ferrari on the world endurance circuit eventually resulting in the production of the ford gt in  as the ford deal fell through fiat approached ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in  enzo ferrari retained a  percent share which is currently owned by his son piero lardi ferrari ferrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licenses many products bearing the ferrari brand including eyewear pens

in cooperation with external design houses like pininfarina or fioravanti and the vehicles receive full homologation to be road legal the first car to be completed under this programme was the

version of their flagship  called the hykers concept ferraris hybrid system adds more than  horsepower on top of the  fioranos  hp also in mid the flagship laferrari was put into production naming conventionsedit until the early s ferrari followed a threenumber naming scheme based on engine displacement v and v models used the total displacement in decilitres for the first two digits and the number of cylinders as the third thus the  was a  l v powered vehicle while the  used a  l v although for the f the last digit refers to  valves per cylinder upon introduction of the  modena the digits for v models which now carried a name as well as a number refer only to total engine displacement the numerical indication aspect of this name carried on to the f however the fs replacement the  italia uses the same naming as the  and  v models used the displacement in cubic centimetres of one cylinder therefore the famed  daytona had a  cc v however some newer vengined ferraris such as the  have threenumber designations that refer only to total engine displacement flat  boxer models used the displacement in litres for the first digit and the number of cylinders for the next two digits therefore the bb  was five litre flat  a berlinetta boxer in this case however the original berlinetta boxer was the  gt bb which was named in a similar manner to the v models flagship models aka halo cars use the letter f followed by the anniversary in years such as the f and f the enzo skipped this rule although the f name was applied to a ferrari formula one car and is sometimes attached to the enzo some models such as the  mondial and the  testarossa did not follow a threenumber naming scheme  scaglietti sessanta edition most ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style in general the following conventions were used m modificata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor and not a complete evolution see f m and  m maranello gtb gran turismo berlinetta models are closed berlinettas or coupés gts gran turismo spider in older models are open spiders or convertibles see  gts however in more recent models this suffix is used for targa top models see dino  gts and f gts the exception being the  ts which is the only targa named differently the convertible models now use the suffix spider spelt i see f spider and  spider gto gran turismo omologata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor indeed those three letters designate a model which has been designed and improved for racetrack use while still being a streetlegal model only three models bear those three letters the  gto of  the  gto of  and the  gto of  this naming system can be confusing as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style many ferraris also had other names affixed like daytona to identify them further many such names are actually not official factory names the daytona name commemorates ferraris triple success in the february   hours of daytona with the  p only in the  daytona  hours a  gtb model run by nart who raced ferraris in america ran second behind a porsche  the various dino models were named for enzos son dino ferrari and were marketed as dinos by ferrari and sold at ferrari dealers—for all intents and purposes they are ferraris in the mids ferrari added the letter f to the beginning of all models a practice abandoned after the f m and f but adopted again with the f but not with its successor the ferrari   identityedit the cavallino rampante with ferrari lettering ferrari head office and factory count francesco baracca coat of arms of the baracca family the famous symbol of the ferrari race team is the cavallino rampante prancing horse black prancing stallion on a yellow shield usually with the letters s f for scuderia ferrari with three stripes of green white and red the italian national colors at the top the road cars have a rectangular badge on the hood see picture at top of page and optionally the shieldshaped race logo on the sides of both front wings close to the door on  june  enzo ferrari won a race at the savio track in ravenna where he met the countess paolina mother of count francesco baracca an ace of the italian air force and national hero of world war i who used to paint a horse on the side of his planes the countess asked enzo to use this horse on his cars suggesting that it would bring him good luck the original prancing horse on baraccas airplane was painted in red on a white cloudlike shape but ferrari chose to have the horse in black as it had been painted as a sign of grief on baraccas squadron planes after the pilot was killed in action and he added a canary yellow background as this is the color of the city of modena his birthplace the ferrari horse was from the very beginning markedly different from the baracca horse in most details the most noticeable being the tail that in the original baracca version was pointing downward ferrari has used the cavallino rampante on official company stationery since  since the spa  hours of  july  the cavallino rampante has been used on alfa romeos raced by scuderia ferrari the motif of a prancing horse is old it can be found on ancient coins a similar black horse on a yellow shield is the coat of arms of the german city of stuttgart home of mercedesbenz and the design bureau of porsche both being main competitors of alfa and ferrari in the s the citys name derives from stutengarten an ancient form of the german word gestüt which translates into english as stud farm and into italian as scuderia porsche also includes the stuttgart sign in its corporate logo centred in the emblem of the state of württemberg stuttgarts rössle has both rear legs firmly planted on the soil like baraccas horse but unlike ferraris cavallino fabio taglioni used the cavallino rampante on his ducati motorbikes as taglioni was born at lugo di romagna like baracca and his father too was a military pilot during wwi although not part of baraccas squadron as is sometimes mistakenly reported as ferraris fame grew ducati abandoned the horse perhaps the result of a private agreement between the two companies austrian fuel stations the cavallino rampante is the visual symbol of ferrari cavallino magazine uses the name but not the logo other companies use similar logos avanti an austrian company operating over  filling stations uses a prancing horse logo which is nearly identical to ferraris as does iron horse bicycles and norfolk southern railway colouredit main article rosso corsa since the s italian race cars of alfa romeo maserati and later ferrari and abarth were and often still are painted in race red rosso corsa this was the customary national racing color of italy as recommended between the world wars by the organizations that later would become the fia it refers to the nationality of the competing team not that of the car manufacturer or driver in that scheme frenchentered cars such as bugatti were blue german such as auto union and mercedes white since  also bare sheet metal silver and british green such as the mids lotus and brm for instance ferrari won the  world championship with john surtees by competing the last two races in north america with cars painted in the usamerican race colors white and blue as these were not entered by the italian factory themselves but by the usbased north american racing team nart team this was done as a protest concerning arguments between ferrari and the italian racing authorities regarding the homologation of a new midengined ferrari race car corporate affairsedit in  enzo ferrari was approached by the ford motor company about a possible buy out ford audited ferraris assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program henry ford ii consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with lotus lola and cooper to build a car capable of beating ferrari on the world endurance circuit eventually resulting in the production of the ford gt in  as the ford deal fell through fiat approached ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in  enzo ferrari retained a  percent share which is currently owned by his son piero lardi ferrari ferrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licenses many products bearing the ferrari brand including eyewear pens pencils electronic goods perfume cologne clothing hightech bicycles watches cell phones and laptop computers ferrari also runs a museum the museo ferrari in maranello which displays road and race cars

supply fuel and oils to the formula one motogp and world superbike racing teams for example the shell vpower premium gasoline fuel has been developed with the many years of technical expertise between

racing teams entries in the final three rounds of the  season were the last occasions on which a team other than scuderia ferrari entered a world championship grand prix with a ferrari car ferrari

version of their flagship  called the hykers concept ferraris hybrid system adds more than  horsepower on top of the  fioranos  hp also in mid the flagship laferrari was put into production naming conventionsedit until the early s ferrari followed a threenumber naming scheme based on engine displacement v and v models used the total displacement in decilitres for the first two digits and the number of cylinders as the third thus the  was a  l v powered vehicle while the  used a  l v although for the f the last digit refers to  valves per cylinder upon introduction of the  modena the digits for v models which now carried a name as well as a number refer only to total engine displacement the numerical indication aspect of this name carried on to the f however the fs replacement the  italia uses the same naming as the  and  v models used the displacement in cubic centimetres of one cylinder therefore the famed  daytona had a  cc v however some newer vengined ferraris such as the  have threenumber designations that refer only to total engine displacement flat  boxer models used the displacement in litres for the first digit and the number of cylinders for the next two digits therefore the bb  was five litre flat  a berlinetta boxer in this case however the original berlinetta boxer was the  gt bb which was named in a similar manner to the v models flagship models aka halo cars use the letter f followed by the anniversary in years such as the f and f the enzo skipped this rule although the f name was applied to a ferrari formula one car and is sometimes attached to the enzo some models such as the  mondial and the  testarossa did not follow a threenumber naming scheme  scaglietti sessanta edition most ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style in general the following conventions were used m modificata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor and not a complete evolution see f m and  m maranello gtb gran turismo berlinetta models are closed berlinettas or coupés gts gran turismo spider in older models are open spiders or convertibles see  gts however in more recent models this suffix is used for targa top models see dino  gts and f gts the exception being the  ts which is the only targa named differently the convertible models now use the suffix spider spelt i see f spider and  spider gto gran turismo omologata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor indeed those three letters designate a model which has been designed and improved for racetrack use while still being a streetlegal model only three models bear those three letters the  gto of  the  gto of  and the  gto of  this naming system can be confusing as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style many ferraris also had other names affixed like daytona to identify them further many such names are actually not official factory names the daytona name commemorates ferraris triple success in the february   hours of daytona with the  p only in the  daytona  hours a  gtb model run by nart who raced ferraris in america ran second behind a porsche  the various dino models were named for enzos son dino ferrari and were marketed as dinos by ferrari and sold at ferrari dealers—for all intents and purposes they are ferraris in the mids ferrari added the letter f to the beginning of all models a practice abandoned after the f m and f but adopted again with the f but not with its successor the ferrari   identityedit the cavallino rampante with ferrari lettering ferrari head office and factory count francesco baracca coat of arms of the baracca family the famous symbol of the ferrari race team is the cavallino rampante prancing horse black prancing stallion on a yellow shield usually with the letters s f for scuderia ferrari with three stripes of green white and red the italian national colors at the top the road cars have a rectangular badge on the hood see picture at top of page and optionally the shieldshaped race logo on the sides of both front wings close to the door on  june  enzo ferrari won a race at the savio track in ravenna where he met the countess paolina mother of count francesco baracca an ace of the italian air force and national hero of world war i who used to paint a horse on the side of his planes the countess asked enzo to use this horse on his cars suggesting that it would bring him good luck the original prancing horse on baraccas airplane was painted in red on a white cloudlike shape but ferrari chose to have the horse in black as it had been painted as a sign of grief on baraccas squadron planes after the pilot was killed in action and he added a canary yellow background as this is the color of the city of modena his birthplace the ferrari horse was from the very beginning markedly different from the baracca horse in most details the most noticeable being the tail that in the original baracca version was pointing downward ferrari has used the cavallino rampante on official company stationery since  since the spa  hours of  july  the cavallino rampante has been used on alfa romeos raced by scuderia ferrari the motif of a prancing horse is old it can be found on ancient coins a similar black horse on a yellow shield is the coat of arms of the german city of stuttgart home of mercedesbenz and the design bureau of porsche both being main competitors of alfa and ferrari in the s the citys name derives from stutengarten an ancient form of the german word gestüt which translates into english as stud farm and into italian as scuderia porsche also includes the stuttgart sign in its corporate logo centred in the emblem of the state of württemberg stuttgarts rössle has both rear legs firmly planted on the soil like baraccas horse but unlike ferraris cavallino fabio taglioni used the cavallino rampante on his ducati motorbikes as taglioni was born at lugo di romagna like baracca and his father too was a military pilot during wwi although not part of baraccas squadron as is sometimes mistakenly reported as ferraris fame grew ducati abandoned the horse perhaps the result of a private agreement between the two companies austrian fuel stations the cavallino rampante is the visual symbol of ferrari cavallino magazine uses the name but not the logo other companies use similar logos avanti an austrian company operating over  filling stations uses a prancing horse logo which is nearly identical to ferraris as does iron horse bicycles and norfolk southern railway colouredit main article rosso corsa since the s italian race cars of alfa romeo maserati and later ferrari and abarth were and often still are painted in race red rosso corsa this was the customary national racing color of italy as recommended between the world wars by the organizations that later would become the fia it refers to the nationality of the competing team not that of the car manufacturer or driver in that scheme frenchentered cars such as bugatti were blue german such as auto union and mercedes white since  also bare sheet metal silver and british green such as the mids lotus and brm for instance ferrari won the  world championship with john surtees by competing the last two races in north america with cars painted in the usamerican race colors white and blue as these were not entered by the italian factory themselves but by the usbased north american racing team nart team this was done as a protest concerning arguments between ferrari and the italian racing authorities regarding the homologation of a new midengined ferrari race car corporate affairsedit in  enzo ferrari was approached by the ford motor company about a possible buy out ford audited ferraris assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program henry ford ii consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with lotus lola and cooper to build a car capable of beating ferrari on the world endurance circuit eventually resulting in the production of the ford gt in  as the ford deal fell through fiat approached ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in  enzo ferrari retained a  percent share which is currently owned by his son piero lardi ferrari ferrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licenses many products bearing the ferrari brand including eyewear pens

version of their flagship  called the hykers concept ferraris hybrid system adds more than  horsepower on top of the  fioranos  hp also in mid the flagship laferrari was put into production naming conventionsedit until the early s ferrari followed a threenumber naming scheme based on engine displacement v and v models used the total displacement in decilitres for the first two digits and the number of cylinders as the third thus the  was a  l v powered vehicle while the  used a  l v although for the f the last digit refers to  valves per cylinder upon introduction of the  modena the digits for v models which now carried a name as well as a number refer only to total engine displacement the numerical indication aspect of this name carried on to the f however the fs replacement the  italia uses the same naming as the  and  v models used the displacement in cubic centimetres of one cylinder therefore the famed  daytona had a  cc v however some newer vengined ferraris such as the  have threenumber designations that refer only to total engine displacement flat  boxer models used the displacement in litres for the first digit and the number of cylinders for the next two digits therefore the bb  was five litre flat  a berlinetta boxer in this case however the original berlinetta boxer was the  gt bb which was named in a similar manner to the v models flagship models aka halo cars use the letter f followed by the anniversary in years such as the f and f the enzo skipped this rule although the f name was applied to a ferrari formula one car and is sometimes attached to the enzo some models such as the  mondial and the  testarossa did not follow a threenumber naming scheme  scaglietti sessanta edition most ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style in general the following conventions were used m modificata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor and not a complete evolution see f m and  m maranello gtb gran turismo berlinetta models are closed berlinettas or coupés gts gran turismo spider in older models are open spiders or convertibles see  gts however in more recent models this suffix is used for targa top models see dino  gts and f gts the exception being the  ts which is the only targa named differently the convertible models now use the suffix spider spelt i see f spider and  spider gto gran turismo omologata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor indeed those three letters designate a model which has been designed and improved for racetrack use while still being a streetlegal model only three models bear those three letters the  gto of  the  gto of  and the  gto of  this naming system can be confusing as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style many ferraris also had other names affixed like daytona to identify them further many such names are actually not official factory names the daytona name commemorates ferraris triple success in the february   hours of daytona with the  p only in the  daytona  hours a  gtb model run by nart who raced ferraris in america ran second behind a porsche  the various dino models were named for enzos son dino ferrari and were marketed as dinos by ferrari and sold at ferrari dealers—for all intents and purposes they are ferraris in the mids ferrari added the letter f to the beginning of all models a practice abandoned after the f m and f but adopted again with the f but not with its successor the ferrari   identityedit the cavallino rampante with ferrari lettering ferrari head office and factory count francesco baracca coat of arms of the baracca family the famous symbol of the ferrari race team is the cavallino rampante prancing horse black prancing stallion on a yellow shield usually with the letters s f for scuderia ferrari with three stripes of green white and red the italian national colors at the top the road cars have a rectangular badge on the hood see picture at top of page and optionally the shieldshaped race logo on the sides of both front wings close to the door on  june  enzo ferrari won a race at the savio track in ravenna where he met the countess paolina mother of count francesco baracca an ace of the italian air force and national hero of world war i who used to paint a horse on the side of his planes the countess asked enzo to use this horse on his cars suggesting that it would bring him good luck the original prancing horse on baraccas airplane was painted in red on a white cloudlike shape but ferrari chose to have the horse in black as it had been painted as a sign of grief on baraccas squadron planes after the pilot was killed in action and he added a canary yellow background as this is the color of the city of modena his birthplace the ferrari horse was from the very beginning markedly different from the baracca horse in most details the most noticeable being the tail that in the original baracca version was pointing downward ferrari has used the cavallino rampante on official company stationery since  since the spa  hours of  july  the cavallino rampante has been used on alfa romeos raced by scuderia ferrari the motif of a prancing horse is old it can be found on ancient coins a similar black horse on a yellow shield is the coat of arms of the german city of stuttgart home of mercedesbenz and the design bureau of porsche both being main competitors of alfa and ferrari in the s the citys name derives from stutengarten an ancient form of the german word gestüt which translates into english as stud farm and into italian as scuderia porsche also includes the stuttgart sign in its corporate logo centred in the emblem of the state of württemberg stuttgarts rössle has both rear legs firmly planted on the soil like baraccas horse but unlike ferraris cavallino fabio taglioni used the cavallino rampante on his ducati motorbikes as taglioni was born at lugo di romagna like baracca and his father too was a military pilot during wwi although not part of baraccas squadron as is sometimes mistakenly reported as ferraris fame grew ducati abandoned the horse perhaps the result of a private agreement between the two companies austrian fuel stations the cavallino rampante is the visual symbol of ferrari cavallino magazine uses the name but not the logo other companies use similar logos avanti an austrian company operating over  filling stations uses a prancing horse logo which is nearly identical to ferraris as does iron horse bicycles and norfolk southern railway colouredit main article rosso corsa since the s italian race cars of alfa romeo maserati and later ferrari and abarth were and often still are painted in race red rosso corsa this was the customary national racing color of italy as recommended between the world wars by the organizations that later would become the fia it refers to the nationality of the competing team not that of the car manufacturer or driver in that scheme frenchentered cars such as bugatti were blue german such as auto union and mercedes white since  also bare sheet metal silver and british green such as the mids lotus and brm for instance ferrari won the  world championship with john surtees by competing the last two races in north america with cars painted in the usamerican race colors white and blue as these were not entered by the italian factory themselves but by the usbased north american racing team nart team this was done as a protest concerning arguments between ferrari and the italian racing authorities regarding the homologation of a new midengined ferrari race car corporate affairsedit in  enzo ferrari was approached by the ford motor company about a possible buy out ford audited ferraris assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program henry ford ii consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with lotus lola and cooper to build a car capable of beating ferrari on the world endurance circuit eventually resulting in the production of the ford gt in  as the ford deal fell through fiat approached ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in  enzo ferrari retained a  percent share which is currently owned by his son piero lardi ferrari ferrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licenses many products bearing the ferrari brand including eyewear pens

version of their flagship  called the hykers concept ferraris hybrid system adds more than  horsepower on top of the  fioranos  hp also in mid the flagship laferrari was put into production naming conventionsedit until the early s ferrari followed a threenumber naming scheme based on engine displacement v and v models used the total displacement in decilitres for the first two digits and the number of cylinders as the third thus the  was a  l v powered vehicle while the  used a  l v although for the f the last digit refers to  valves per cylinder upon introduction of the  modena the digits for v models which now carried a name as well as a number refer only to total engine displacement the numerical indication aspect of this name carried on to the f however the fs replacement the  italia uses the same naming as the  and  v models used the displacement in cubic centimetres of one cylinder therefore the famed  daytona had a  cc v however some newer vengined ferraris such as the  have threenumber designations that refer only to total engine displacement flat  boxer models used the displacement in litres for the first digit and the number of cylinders for the next two digits therefore the bb  was five litre flat  a berlinetta boxer in this case however the original berlinetta boxer was the  gt bb which was named in a similar manner to the v models flagship models aka halo cars use the letter f followed by the anniversary in years such as the f and f the enzo skipped this rule although the f name was applied to a ferrari formula one car and is sometimes attached to the enzo some models such as the  mondial and the  testarossa did not follow a threenumber naming scheme  scaglietti sessanta edition most ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style in general the following conventions were used m modificata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor and not a complete evolution see f m and  m maranello gtb gran turismo berlinetta models are closed berlinettas or coupés gts gran turismo spider in older models are open spiders or convertibles see  gts however in more recent models this suffix is used for targa top models see dino  gts and f gts the exception being the  ts which is the only targa named differently the convertible models now use the suffix spider spelt i see f spider and  spider gto gran turismo omologata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor indeed those three letters designate a model which has been designed and improved for racetrack use while still being a streetlegal model only three models bear those three letters the  gto of  the  gto of  and the  gto of  this naming system can be confusing as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style many ferraris also had other names affixed like daytona to identify them further many such names are actually not official factory names the daytona name commemorates ferraris triple success in the february   hours of daytona with the  p only in the  daytona  hours a  gtb model run by nart who raced ferraris in america ran second behind a porsche  the various dino models were named for enzos son dino ferrari and were marketed as dinos by ferrari and sold at ferrari dealers—for all intents and purposes they are ferraris in the

track in ravenna where he met the countess paolina mother of count francesco baracca an ace of the italian air force and national hero of world war i who used to paint a horse on the side of his planes the countess asked enzo to use this horse on his cars suggesting that it would bring him good luck the original prancing horse on baraccas airplane was painted in red on a white cloudlike shape but ferrari chose to have the horse in black as it had been painted as a sign of grief on baraccas squadron planes after the pilot was killed in action and he added a canary yellow background as this is the color of the city of modena his birthplace the ferrari horse was from the very beginning markedly different from the baracca horse in most details the most noticeable being the tail that in the original baracca version was pointing downward ferrari has used the cavallino rampante on official company stationery since  since the spa  hours of  july  the cavallino rampante has been used on alfa romeos raced by scuderia ferrari the motif of a prancing horse is old it can be found on ancient coins a similar black horse on a yellow shield is the coat of arms of the german city of stuttgart home of mercedesbenz and the design bureau of porsche both being main competitors of alfa and ferrari in the s the citys name derives from stutengarten an ancient form of the german word gestüt which translates into english as stud farm and into italian as scuderia porsche also includes the stuttgart sign in its corporate logo centred in the emblem of the state of württemberg stuttgarts rössle has both rear legs firmly planted on the soil like baraccas horse but unlike ferraris cavallino fabio taglioni used the cavallino rampante on his ducati motorbikes as taglioni was born at lugo di romagna like baracca and his father too was a military pilot during wwi although not part of baraccas squadron as is sometimes mistakenly reported as ferraris fame grew ducati abandoned the horse perhaps the result of a private agreement between the two companies austrian fuel stations the cavallino rampante is the visual symbol of ferrari cavallino magazine uses the name but not the logo other companies use similar logos avanti an austrian company operating over  filling stations uses a prancing horse logo which is nearly identical to ferraris as does iron horse bicycles and norfolk southern railway colouredit main article rosso corsa since the s italian race cars of alfa romeo maserati and later ferrari and abarth were and often still are painted in race red rosso corsa this was the customary national racing color of italy as recommended between the world wars by the organizations that later would become the fia it refers to the nationality of the competing team not that of the car manufacturer or driver in that scheme frenchentered cars such as bugatti were blue german such as auto union and mercedes white since  also bare sheet metal silver and british green such as the mids lotus and brm for instance ferrari won the  world championship with john surtees by competing the last two races in north america with cars painted in the usamerican race colors white and blue as these were not entered by the italian factory themselves but by the usbased north american racing team nart team this was done as a protest concerning arguments between ferrari and the italian racing authorities regarding the homologation of a new midengined ferrari race car corporate affairsedit in  enzo ferrari was approached by the ford motor company about a possible buy out ford audited ferraris assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program henry ford ii consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with lotus lola and cooper to build a car capable of beating ferrari on the world endurance circuit eventually resulting in the production of the ford gt in  as the ford deal fell through fiat approached ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in  enzo ferrari retained a  percent share which is currently owned by his son piero lardi ferrari ferrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licenses many products bearing the ferrari brand including eyewear pens

sp rw competizione  ftdf ferrari j   spider — biofuel and hybrid carsedit a f spider that runs on ethanol was displayed at the  detroit auto show at the  geneva motor show ferrari unveiled a hybrid version of their flagship  called the hykers concept ferraris hybrid system adds more than  horsepower on top of the  fioranos  hp also in mid the flagship laferrari was put into production naming conventionsedit until the early s ferrari followed a threenumber naming scheme based on engine displacement v and v models used the total displacement in decilitres for the first two digits and the number of cylinders as the third thus the  was a  l v powered vehicle while the  used a  l v although for the f the last digit refers to  valves per cylinder upon introduction of the  modena the digits for v models which now carried a name as well as a number refer only to total engine displacement the numerical indication aspect of this name carried on to the f however the fs replacement the  italia uses the same naming as the  and  v models used the displacement in cubic centimetres of one cylinder therefore the famed  daytona had a  cc v however some newer vengined ferraris such as the  have threenumber designations that refer only to total engine displacement flat  boxer models used the displacement in litres for the first digit and the number of cylinders for the next two digits therefore the bb  was five litre flat  a berlinetta boxer in this case however the original berlinetta boxer was the  gt bb which was named in a similar manner to the v models flagship models aka halo cars use the letter f followed by the anniversary in years such as the f and f the enzo skipped this rule although the f name was applied to a ferrari formula one car and is sometimes attached to the enzo some models such as the  mondial and the  testarossa did not follow a threenumber naming scheme  scaglietti sessanta edition most ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style in general the following conventions were used m modificata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor and not a complete evolution see f m and  m maranello gtb gran turismo berlinetta models are closed berlinettas or coupés gts gran turismo spider in older models are open spiders or convertibles see  gts however in more recent models this suffix is used for targa top models see dino  gts and f gts the exception being the  ts which is the only targa named differently the convertible models now use the suffix spider spelt i see f spider and  spider gto gran turismo omologata placed at the end of a models number denotes a modified version of its predecessor indeed those three letters designate a model which has been designed and improved for racetrack use while still being a streetlegal model only three models bear those three letters the  gto of  the  gto of  and the  gto of  this naming system can be confusing as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style many ferraris also had other names affixed like daytona to identify them further many such names are actually not official factory names the daytona name commemorates ferraris triple success in the february   hours of daytona with the  p only in the  daytona  hours a  gtb model run by nart who raced ferraris in america ran second behind a porsche  the various dino models were named for enzos son dino ferrari and were marketed as dinos by ferrari and sold at ferrari dealers—for all intents and purposes they are ferraris in the mids ferrari added the letter f to the beginning of all models a practice abandoned after the f m and f but adopted again with the f but not with its successor the ferrari   identityedit the cavallino rampante with ferrari lettering ferrari head office and factory count francesco baracca coat of arms of the baracca family the famous symbol of the ferrari race team is the cavallino rampante prancing horse black prancing stallion on a yellow shield usually with the letters s f for scuderia ferrari with three stripes of green white and red the italian national colors at the top the road cars have a rectangular badge on the hood see picture at top of page and optionally the shieldshaped race logo on the sides of both front wings close to the door on  june  enzo ferrari won a race at the savio track in ravenna where he met the countess paolina mother of count francesco baracca an ace of the italian air force and national hero of world war i who used to paint a horse on the side of his planes the countess asked enzo to use this horse on his cars suggesting that it would bring him good luck the original prancing horse on baraccas airplane was painted in red on a white cloudlike shape but ferrari chose to have the horse in black as it had been painted as a sign of grief on baraccas squadron planes after the pilot was killed in action and he added a canary yellow background as this is the color of the city of modena his birthplace the ferrari horse was from the very beginning markedly different from the baracca horse in most details the most noticeable being the tail that in the original baracca version was pointing downward ferrari has used the cavallino rampante on official company stationery since  since the spa  hours of  july  the cavallino rampante has been used on alfa romeos raced by scuderia ferrari the motif of a prancing horse is old it can be found on ancient coins a similar black horse on a yellow shield is the coat of arms of the german city of stuttgart home of mercedesbenz and the design bureau of porsche both being main competitors of alfa and ferrari in the s the citys name derives from stutengarten an ancient form of the german word gestüt which translates into english as stud farm and into italian as scuderia porsche also includes the stuttgart sign in its corporate logo centred in the emblem of the state of württemberg stuttgarts rössle has both rear legs firmly planted on the soil like baraccas horse but unlike ferraris cavallino fabio taglioni used the cavallino rampante on his ducati motorbikes as taglioni was born at lugo di romagna like baracca and his father too was a military pilot during wwi although not part of baraccas squadron as is sometimes mistakenly reported as ferraris fame grew ducati abandoned the horse perhaps the result of a private agreement between the two companies austrian fuel stations the cavallino rampante is the visual symbol of ferrari cavallino magazine uses the name but not the logo other companies use similar logos avanti an austrian company operating over  filling stations uses a prancing horse logo which is nearly identical to ferraris as does iron horse bicycles and norfolk southern railway colouredit main article rosso corsa since the s italian race cars of alfa romeo maserati and later ferrari and abarth were and often still are painted in race red rosso corsa this was the customary national racing color of italy as recommended between the world wars by the organizations that later would become the fia it refers to the nationality of the competing team not that of the car manufacturer or driver in that scheme frenchentered cars such as bugatti were blue german such as auto union and mercedes white since  also bare sheet metal silver and british green such as the mids lotus and brm for instance ferrari won the  world championship with john surtees by competing the last two races in north america with cars painted in the usamerican race colors white and blue as these were not entered by the italian factory themselves but by the usbased north american racing team nart team this was done as a protest concerning arguments between ferrari and the italian racing authorities regarding the homologation of a new midengined ferrari race car corporate affairsedit in  enzo ferrari was approached by the ford motor company about a possible buy out ford audited ferraris assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program henry ford ii consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with lotus lola and cooper to build a car capable of beating ferrari on the world endurance circuit eventually resulting in the production of the ford gt in  as the ford deal fell through fiat approached ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in  enzo ferrari retained a  percent share which is currently owned by his son piero lardi ferrari ferrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licenses many products bearing the ferrari brand including eyewear pens pencils electronic goods perfume cologne clothing hightech bicycles watches cell phones and laptop computers ferrari also runs a museum the museo ferrari in maranello which displays road and race cars

responsibility towards the community that is home to the maranello campus and to its own workforce is therefore inextricably linked to the quality and safety of the working environment a unique

competition in the luxury performance car market is concentrated in a fairly small number of producers including both large automotive companies as well as small producers exclusively focused on luxury cars like us the luxury performance car market includes a sports car segment and a gt segment in the sports car segment our products are the  gtb  spider  italia  spider  speciale  speciale aperta and fberlinetta and our principal competitors are lamborghini huracán and aventador mclaren s porsche  turbo and turbo s mercedes sl  amg aston martin vanquish and v vantage s and audi r v in the gt segment our products are the california t and ff models and our principal competitors are rollsroyce wraith bentley cont gtgtc v and v speed and s version gtr aston martin db and mercedes cl  amg s coupé  amg in recent years the market has shifted somewhat with an increased focus on the gt segment and the lower priced range of the sports car market with larger automotive groups expanding their offering of premium cars to enter the luxury performance car market competition in the luxury performance car market is driven by the strength of the brand and the appeal of the products in terms of performance styling novelty and innovation as well as on the manufacturers’ ability to renew its product offerings regularly in order to continue to stimulate customer demand larger automotive groups with a product offering in the luxury performance car market typically have larger financial resources compared to the small luxury car producers and therefore may have more flexibility in planning for product launches and capital spending over time competition among similarly positioned luxury performance cars is also driven by price and total cost of ownership we believe that the resilience of the value of our cars after a period of ownership is an important competitive factor because it decreases the total cost of ownership for our clients and promotes repeat purchases company description ferrari is among the world’s leading luxury brands focused on the design engineering production and sale of the world’s most recognizable luxury performance sports cars our brand symbolizes luxury exclusivity innovation stateoftheart sporting performance and italian design and engineering heritage our name and history and the image enjoyed by our cars are closely
