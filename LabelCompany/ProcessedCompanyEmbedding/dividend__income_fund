lipper’s general usstock category as well as one in world equity which combines global and international funds also required is at least one mixedasset or balanced fund which holds stocks and bonds fund shops also must have at least two taxablebond funds and one taxexempt offering for the first time this year the performance of emergingmarket funds was included in the world equity category each fund’s returns are adjusted for b fees which are used for marketing and distribution expenses the funds usually add these fees back into returns the aim is to measure the manager’s skill fund loads or sales charges aren’t included in the calculation of returns either each fund’s return is measured against those of all funds in its lipper category that leads to a percentile ranking with  the highest and  the lowest which is then weighted by asset size relative to the fund family’s other assets in its general classification if a family’s biggest funds do well that boosts its overall ranking poor performance in a big fund can have a big effect on the ranking finally the score is multiplied by the weighting of its general classification as determined by the entire lipper universe of funds  category weightings for oneyear results general equity  world equity  mixedasset  taxable bonds  and taxexempt bonds   category weightings for oneyear results general equity  world equity  mixed equity  taxable bonds  taxexempt bonds  the scoring say a company has a fund in the general us equity category that has  million in assets and that it accounts for half of the company’s assets in that category its ranking is the th percentile the first calculation would be  times  which comes to  that score is then multiplied by  general equity’s overall weighting in lipper’s universe so it would be  times  which totals  similar calculations are done for each fund in our study then all the numbers are added up for a total score the fund shop with the highest score wins both for every category

for the semiannual reporting period ending may   the funds share classes gained about  topping the  return of the benchmark russell ® value index after lagging the benchmark in december and january – amid market turbulence triggered by the us presidential election – the fund responded well to the managers emphasis on stocks of highquality dividendpaying companies stock selection in the financials sector had by far the largest positive impact on relative performance while positioning in consumer staples and real estate also helped in energy stock picking lifted relative performance but was offset by an overweighting in this lagging sector positioning in consumer discretionary telecommunication services and utilities modestly detracted from performance versus the benchmark on april   john sheehy became the funds comanager a post he will hold through december   at which time he will be named sole portfolio manager qa an interview with lead portfolio manager scott offen and comanager john sheehy scott how did the fund perform for the semiannual reporting period ending may   so the funds share classes gained about  topping the  return of the benchmark russell ® value index however the fund fell short of the peer group average this period after lagging the benchmark in december and january – amid market turbulence triggered by the us presidential election – the fund responded well to our emphasis on stocks of highquality dividendpaying companies looking a bit longer term the fund finished behind both its benchmark and peer average for the trailing year what was noteworthy about the investing backdrop the past six months so interestingly most of the gyrations caused by the us presidential election had played out prior to december  the beginning of this reporting period for example wed seen a huge month of outperformance by the financials sector in november as investors aggressively bought bank shares in response to sharply higher interest rates and the possibility of faster economic growth and higher loan demand however bank stocks modestly lagged the benchmark for the sixmonth reporting period as promises by the new administration to loosen regulatory requirements for banks have so far gone unfulfilled consequently investors who really loaded up on bank stocks this period probably were disappointed we tend not to jump on each new hot trend in hopes of riding it for quick gains rather we aim to have balanced exposure to each market sector and try to add value mainly through stock selection as well as industry selection within each sector we do respond to trends that we believe might be significant and durable for instance wed overweighted banks since around the middle of  because at that point interest rates were exceptionally low and sentiment about bank shares seemed to be too negative we maintained this positioning until may when we lightened up on our bank holdings and brought them back to roughly a neutral weighting although stock picking in financials was by far the largest positive influence on relative performance the past six months it was the diversified financials group rather than banks that primarily drove results in the sector elsewhere positioning in consumer staples and real estate helped in energy stock picking lifted relative performance but was offset by an overweighting in this lagging sector which individual holdings helped relative performance most so eight of the  largest relative contributors were nonbenchmark positions reflecting our willingness to look far and wide for attractive opportunities and not restrict our view to whats in the benchmark the top contributor versus the benchmark was ukbased consumer goods company unilever one of the largest outofbenchmark positions in the fund and a stock ive followed for quite some time i ramped up our exposure to unilever this period based on how inexpensive i thought it was the firms exposure to morevibrant emerging markets and its healthy dividend yield the stocks performance also benefited from the unsuccessful midfebruary bid for the company by us rival kraft heinz overweighting apple also lifted our relative result this stock was the beneficiary of improving expectations about the next iteration of the firms iphone® device scheduled for release in the fall of  and rumored to be a major upgrade in my view investors frequently have underestimated the value of the apple franchise and ecosystem of applications granted its now a megacap stock and the companys fastest growth probably is behind it but apple still enjoys tremendous brand loyalty next ill mention alternativeasset manager blackstone group another nonbenchmark position this company continued to profit from its expertise in managing private equity hedge funds and other nonstandard investments which produced healthy capital inflows and profits for the firm i liked blackstones strong cash flow clean balance sheet and generous dividend yield how about detractors so positioning in consumer discretionary telecommunication services and utilities modestly detracted from performance versus the benchmark several positions that hurt fund performance were energy companies including an outofbenchmark position in cenovus energy the funds largest relative detractor this stock lost ground partly because of the firms decision this period to purchase most of the canadian assets of us energy giant conocophillips the consensus was that cenovus overpaid for these assets a falling price for crude oil also hampered the stock i liked the company for its production profile and its considerable exposure to the price of oil as i thought the supplydemand situation in crude might improve in the next year or two shares of pipeline operator williams companies also lagged despite its lower dependence on energy prices highquality assets and generous dividend yield i reduced our cenovus and williams positions but maintained meaningful exposure in both cases turning to you john how was the fund positioned on may js my investment philosophy is similar to scotts so weve not made major changes to the funds positioning the fund continued to have a modestly cyclical tilt at period end with overweightings in information technology and energy and roughly neutral exposure to financials somewhat balancing these morecyclical segments the funds largest sector overweighting on may  was consumer staples a defensive group where we added exposure this period the largest sector underweightings at period end were real estate and utilities two groups that tend to move in tandem with bond prices we thought interest rates could rise much further over time potentially hurting stocks in these sectors and valuations seemed relatively unattractive given the meager growth we anticipated there in closing scott and i are focused on finding good dividendpaying businesses with sustainably high returns on capital that we can buy at attractive valuations in the callout box that follows i offer further observations about the recent economic environment and our approach to selecting dividend stocks ■ john sheehy on the us economy and how he selects dividendpaying stocks although scott and i believe that the us economic expansion that began in  is getting long in the tooth there appear to be relatively few signs of stress in the economy unemployment is low and there is modest wage growth which means the consumer likely is in decent shape and able to continue spending rising interest rates make all kinds of adjustablerate debt more expensive to service and we would be concerned if rates rose too far too fast so far though that doesnt appear to be a concern in fact after spiking higher just after the election marketdriven rates have fallen slightly beginning around midmarch us stock valuations are a potential headwind as well now that price multiples have expanded so much any further gains likely will be limited by earnings growth yet we see many highquality companies that we believe can continue to grow their earnings and raise their dividends as a reminder we dont simply look for the companies paying the highest dividend yields that approach often leads to buying stagnant companies that prove to be value traps – that is firms whose shares seem cheap at first glance but subsequently get cheaper because of significant fundamentals flaws in contrast we exhaustively analyze a companys cash flow – both current and potential – as well as its balance sheet and management team we look for firms with moderately high current yields that look to have stable revenue and earnings growth to fuel regularly increasing payouts in future years market recap the us equity
