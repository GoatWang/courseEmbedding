visibility join now or log in about savant capital llc the groundwork for savant began many years ago thomas a muldowney started the predecessor to savant in  in rockford il it was called savant planning group ltd tom responded to his frustration with how financial services were traditionally offered—suspicious advice given away for “free” in exchange for the sale of a commissioned product however individuals really needed true independent financial and estate planning advice that was unbiased by inherent conflicts of interest after several years and much effort tom had built a thriving feeonly planning practice still his clients had no systematic way to implement the investment strategies necessary to execute his clients financial plans so tom became partners with brent r brodeski in  tom and brent then embarked on a journey to determine how to best provide tom’s financial planning clients with the feeonly investment management capabilities that they badly needed and requested after many months of research tom and brent concluded that a noload indexbased investment approach that benefited from low portfolio turnover low cost low taxes and broad global diversification would provide clients the best opportunity for success since traditional product oriented providers were unwilling to offer such an approach savant set out to create a service that would first and foremost meet the needs of the client in the most efficient and effective manner possible with this savant capital management inc was born we believe savant is in a unique position to provide unbiased
