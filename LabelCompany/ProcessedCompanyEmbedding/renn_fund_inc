proxy voting policy finding midas articles entrepreneurial ceo investing newsletter   interview renn capital group president and ceo russell    cleveland talks with the opportunist’s managing editor leslie stone about his company’s founderowner concept of investing which market sectors hold the most promise and what it takes for entrepreneurs to succeed in today’s economy         during his year career in the investment business russell cleveland has learned that if the people at the top of a publicly traded company are significant owners in the company’s stock that stock could possibly be a big winner “i call it the founderowner concept and it’s real simple invest only in companies where your senior management are major stock owners because their interest and your interest are aligned” he explains “take apple for example if you had invested in apple in  when steve jobs came back and it was trading at  per share just think of the gains you would have made at  to  if you made a  investment in about  walmart shares when sam walton took the company public in the s you would own over  shares today worth over  million we are talking about mega gains with any amount of money you would have put in it’s the same with warren buffett and berkshire hathaway larry ellison and oracle corp phil knight and nike and starbucks with howard schultz what i found is if you’re patient and have a portfolio—and i say portfolio because if you pick just one founderowner stock it invariably will be the wrong one” in other words if the founderowners of a company are heavily invested in the company’s stock they are going to do everything in their power to ensure the company’s success “think back to when we had the big financial meltdown in ” cleveland continues “only one automotive company didn’t need a bailout and that was ford motor co why because when times got tough the familyowners ie ford family came through and the company didn’t need a bailout meanwhile the professional management at gm failed miserably if i had my life to do over again i would buy a portfolio of maybe  to  founderowner stocks and not really worry about what the federal reserve and the economists are saying i would be very patient and go with these people who continue to do well if in  i had just invested say  into berkshire hathaway when warren buffett took it over—and that was kind of a reverse takeover—i would have over  million today”   his concept does require due diligence cleveland says because management will often show up as owners when they really only have stock options “founderowners are people who have their own money at stake people take care of their own money better than other people’s money founderowner is a very interesting concept it’s something that just like with anything else you’ve just got to know how to do it you cannot be scared out of your stocks you have to be patient because it’s a longterm strategy but it does work”   cleveland and associate eric stephens have been running an index at renn capital that is based on the founderowner concept  he says as of june   it is up  percent over the past three years when compared to the russell  at  percent and the sp at  percent “we don’t publish our index but we could” he says “we have  companies in the index including big companies midsize and small if you had been investing with this index over  years you would be up  percent you would have done best in midcaps because the last  years haven’t been as good for the smaller companies the point i want to make is if you are patient and invest in a portfolio as opposed to simply picking the popular stock of today then you have the probability of doing well”   opportunist how did you get into the investment business   russell cleveland i grew up in el paso and attended el paso high school where i played tennis and music quite by luck a gentleman from the university of pennsylvania came to town and said he thought i would do great at the wharton school and offered to help me get a scholarship as fate would have it i ended up there and was captain of the tennis team and graduated in  with a plan to go on to law school then i took an introductory course on the study of law and thanked the professor because i decided i definitely wasn’t going into law after graduation i went to work for kidder peabody  co an oldline brokerage firm that had underwritten att and companies like that that was back in the old partnership days i had a good experience there and met a lot of interesting people and learned a lot in  after several years at kidder peabody  co i came to dallas and i have been here ever since i joined several regional firms the largest of which was rauscher pierce—now part of the royal bank of canada—where i was head of the research department  it’s astounding how few firms that were around  years ago are still here today   opportunist please tell us about renn capital group   russell cleveland  i founded renaissance capital group which is now renn capital group in  we have been around for  years and have always been an investor manager primarily handling private partnerships for wealthy families and individuals in the  million to  million range this has been very successful for us we would get x dollars and we would invest and work with these companies and five years later we would liquidate and everybody would go to the bank in recent years our focus has been on closedend funds we have been involved in a substantial fund in great britain for a number of years we have never been a mutual fund manager company in the sense of openend funds we tend to focus on smaller entrepreneur funds that invest in   or  companies and then liquidate and pay our investors cash returns our main business here has always been investment management and helping companies go from point a to point b of course we have had some companies that haven’t succeeded our specialty is smallcap growth areas or microcap companies—early stage or later stage—under  million that is all we really do—and turnarounds too we have never invested in large caps such as att   opportunist you are known for your optimistic approach to the market why is that   russell cleveland i think optimism always works better than pessimism—unless you are writing a book  i prefer the word realist if you want to start companies and make money and succeed in this world you have to be optimistic to make things happen pessimism has very rarely worked in the stock market or in business   opportunist what are some of your bestperforming smallcap stocks   russell cleveland one of our bestperforming stocks in the s and early s was a company called service corporation this was an nyse listed company in the business of acquiring funeral homes all over the us service corp eventually became the largest provider of funeral and cemetery services in the country and its share price went from  to over — times your money—and even became peter lynch’s favorite stock at one point we have been out of it a long time now but it was a very successful company for us another big winner for us in the last decade was laserscope a californiabased company that provides minimally invasive surgical systems we joined the party and invested money when the stock was about  on the board the stock went as high as  and the company sold for  a share   opportunist what is your favorite market sector   russell cleveland we have always been interested in technology—particularly medical technology—and laserscope is an example of something that worked very well for us i could go on and on … we have obviously had some companies that were unsuccessful—usually due to a management problem we are looking for companies that can grow rapidly given x amount of money   there are new entrepreneurs coming in all the time and lots of them are in the connected world of facebook and google and things of that nature  i believe we have moved from the industrial age to the knowledge age meaning computers and software and now we are in the connect age this is very important when looking at investments the internet is something very new and exciting   opportunist what does it take for an entrepreneur andor small business to succeed in today’s market     russell cleveland first you need a good idea and a unique product or service that has some special advantage in the marketplace what’s great about today is the internet and this whole internet connected world that gives companies the ability to grow rapidly through worldwide distribution  to be successful you have to know how to run a business generate revenues and control costs most of all you have to be willing to meet challenges because there’s some type of challenge almost every single day the late british historian arnold toynbee said all history is about meeting challenges—challenge and response your success is dependent upon how willing you are to do whatever it takes in terms of commitment and challenges some entrepreneurs can meet challenges and others cannot but the most successful entrepreneurs meet challenges head on  failing is part of winning and if you’re afraid to fail you will never do anything you have to fail sometimes before you can win think of it as a game where sometimes you win and sometimes you lose nobody wins  percent of the time in sports i have never lost a golf tournament and there’s one reason why i have never played one you must give value in your product or service and you also must receive value back ie positive cash flow because no matter what wall street says from time to time profits do matter  making a dollar and losing a nickel won’t make you successful most successful entrepreneurs i know also have a knack for working with and managing other people they understand that their most valuable asset is their team and they reward their team   opportunist as a portfolio manager and investor what’s your greatest fear in the markets right now   russell cleveland well the greatest fear is government itself at the federal level we are spending a whole lot more than we are taking in the government is out of control there’s a litany of agencies that keep getting bigger and bigger and are a drain on the economy look at the irs the fcc and the epa for example and then there is the whole entitlements program such as retirements and so forth and many of those are good programs and necessary but we need to balance the money we take in obamacare is a bad threat and the average person has no idea how bad that will become we really must get control of government spending  bigger deficits and bigger government means that economic growth is going to be stifled   opportunist do you believe america’s manufacturing base can make a comeback   russell cleveland my view is that we probably aren’t ever going back to where we were because our labor costs are just way too high take apple for example apple products are designed in california but made in china i have traveled extensively in china and visited a lot of factories there and i seriously doubt we could make an apple product in california and remain competitive it would be great to get manufacturing back and if you can manufacture with automation then we can certainly be competitive we do have people who know how to do automation in terms of the connected economy we are the leaders in the whole internet space and i believe we can continue to dominate that   opportunist what inspired you to write your book finding midas the way to mega stock gains and how long did it take to complete the project   russell cleveland my book came out in  and it’s a very quick read based upon the idea of ceo investing i don’t think we used the term founderowner in the book but we do prefer that term because most people think entrepreneur means venture capitalist but warren buffett is not in venture capital it took me quite a while to get all these ideas down on paper if i could start life over again i would focus on the central theme of entrepreneur investing and use a checklist   opportunist what type of checklist   russell cleveland i would find out if the ceo and the management team are significant owners in the company is the company profitable and reasonably priced you only need four or five items on your checklist to be successful … but you need patience if you’re the type of investor who gets up every morning and reads the headlines and listens to the economists you will be scared right out of your investments  investing based on a founderowner approach has become a labor of love and i only wish i had known this many years ago   opportunist who inspired your success   russell cleveland i would say there are many people who gave me a real start in life my mother was one of them my father flew in a b in world war ii and never really recovered i was never a good student until a teacher in the fourth grade recognized my work and gave me a star on a little project it’s hard to believe that something so trivial made me realize that it’s much easier to succeed whether in college or business or life in general but it did and i just kept on going there is a music professorship in my name at the university of texas at dallas i became involved in the guitar world and got to know most of the great classical guitarists like pepe romero david russell and eliot fisk in  when i had been in business for  years i sent thankyou notes and an inexpensive gold watch to the top  people who had helped me—people from my college days as well as kidder peabody  co and rauscher pierce and everywhere in between i could come up with  more people to thank in the last  years alone  on october   i am launching world connect day the concept is to appreciate and thank those who have helped you   opportunist what are your thoughts on america’s economic recovery   russell cleveland i believe there will likely be some downdrafts where people will be shocked that we aren’t doing better but i still see the us economy kind of muddling through until we get a better handle on government spending and government growth the country has fallen into this whole idea that fairness means socialism and is so focused on taxing people that it doesn’t have a clue how to get entrepreneurs going it’s hard to create jobs when you hate the job creators that’s the mindset we’ve got in washington and that’s hampering economic growth what we need are opportunities for everybody i believe the american dream is intact  people need to be proactive and start thinking about hiring someone else instead of someone hiring them be a job creator  i am quite optimistic about where we are and i believe there are great opportunities you just have to think differently and stay attuned to new industries   i believe we are in a year primary bull market that started about  and will continue with periodic downdrafts we spent about  years in a bear market—nasdaq hit  in  and it’s only up to  more than a dozen years later we are nowhere near where we were a decade ago the trick is to make sure you ride along and don’t get scared out of your stocks i am seeing the market very optimistically during the next two or three years   opportunist we understand you do a lot of work with entrepreneurs   russell cleveland yes i do an annual entrepreneurial leadership seminar at southern methodist university for mba graduate students it’s all about starting businesses how to get going and what to look for and so forth i put this on with several other gentlemen and it is such an interesting topic that we are among the highest ranked speakers at smu   i also serve on a number of boards one of the successful companies i am associated with is anchorfree they offer a service that protects your privacy online and make sure that no one from google to the government will know who you are go to their website zwwwanchorfreecom and check it out once we became involved the company started thinking about making money every day they became very successful and currently have about  million downloads worldwide many users are in the middle east and china during that recent ordeal in turkey where the government was going after people in the park  downloads were made in just one day  the company’s founderowner is david gorodyansky he came from russia and founded the company in the silicon valley at age    opportunist what do you enjoy most about your work   russell cleveland working with companies that are succeeding  i believe i have gotten better at meeting challenges i love working with companies and making money for investors including myself—but i must tell you that i am not attached to money in terms of owning yachts and other expensive toys  what inspires me the most is seeing things succeed and working with management i admit that it’s fun to go to the bank every once in a while—it’s all part of the game—and i love playing the game i really do  i have always said my epitaph should read ‘lifetime student’  let’s all keep being students   visit renn capital group – wwwrencapitalcom

ceo investing russell cleveland the author of finding midas explains his investment strategies in a video that can be accessed by clicking on his picture dallas texas september   business wire as a chartered financial analyst with over  years of experience specializing in small cap companies russell cleveland is uniquely qualified to author a book on investing his new book finding midas investing in entrepreneurial ceos with the golden touch should be required reading for every broker and advisor in the business according to don hodges chairman of the hodges fund no matter the experience level anybody with an interest in investing is sure to get much out of this book mr cleveland has developed a revolutionary method of analyzing companies  look at the ceo he contends that the companies with the strongest and most involved leaders are the ones that will prevail in both good times and bad he calls these megastocks that can return tens to hundreds of times your investment the key to megastock investing is not focusing on the industry but rather on the entrepreneurial leadership characteristics of the ceo   you might just find the next walmart starbucks or ebay according to the author how does one determine if the ceo is investment worthy cleveland outlines four major criteria that must be met ·         the ceo and management must have a major stake in the business ·         there must be a clear vision with aboveaverage growth prospects ·         the company must be profitable ·         the valuation must be reasonable one of the keys of this investment method is performing due diligence on the management team are their goals aligned with those of the shareholders if they are shareholders themselves then the answer is yes mr cleveland makes a distinction between ceos who are rewarded with options and those who actually use their own dollars to invest in the company  those who have skin in the game leadership is a key trait exhibited by all successful entrepreneurial ceos the ability to get the entire company to buy in can make the difference between success and failure in the book there are numerous suggestions on how to find strong entrepreneurial ceos today as well as some red flags to be cautious of  the book also identifies common traps that investors fall into such as buying stocks that are overvalued and having a shortterm investment mentality the author likens these investment tactics as the equivalent of shooting craps in las vegas  the book concludes with  case studies of winning entrepreneurs who have driven their companies and their valuations  to the top by analyzing the case studies and applying the principles and strategies detailed in the book investors may have an opportunity to improve
