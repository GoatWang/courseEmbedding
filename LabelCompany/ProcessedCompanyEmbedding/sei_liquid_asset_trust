other funds description of permitted investments and risk factors assetbacked securitiesthe prime obligation and money market funds may invest in assetbacked securities assetbacked securities are securities secured by nonmortgage assets such as company receivables truck and auto loans leases and credit card receivables such securities are generally issued as passthrough certificates which represent undivided fractional ownership interests in the underlying pools of assets such securities also may be debt instruments which are also known as collateralized obligations and are generally issued as the debt of a special purpose entity such as a trust organized solely for the purpose of owning such assets and issuing such debt assetbacked securities are not issued or guaranteed by the united states government or its agencies or instrumentalities however the payment of principal and interest on such obligations may be guaranteed up to certain amounts and for a certain period by a letter of credit issued by a financial institution such as a bank or insurance company unaffiliated with the issuers of such securities the purchase of assetbacked securities raises risk considerations peculiar to the financing of the instruments underlying such securities for example there is a risk that another party could acquire an interest in the obligations superior to that of the holders of the assetbacked securities there also is the possibility that recoveries on repossessed s collateral may not in some cases be available to support payments on those securities assetbacked securities entail prepayment risk which may vary depending on the type of asset but is generally less than the prepayment risk associated with mortgagebacked securities in addition credit card receivables are unsecured obligations of the card holder the market for assetbacked securities is at a relatively early stage of development accordingly there may be a limited secondary market for such securities bankers acceptancesthe prime obligation and money market funds may invest in bankers acceptances a bankers acceptance is a bill of exchange or time draft drawn on and accepted by a

gnma certificates have a shorter average maturity and therefore less principal volatility than a comparable year mortgagebacked bond since prepayment rates vary widely it is not possible to accurately predict the average maturity of a particular gnma pool the scheduled monthly interest and principal payments relating to mortgages in the pool will be passed through to investors gnma securities differ from conventional bonds in that principal is paid back to the certificate holders over the life of the loan rather than at maturity as a result the funds will receive monthly scheduled payments of principal and interest in addition the funds may receive unscheduled principal payments representing prepayments on the underlying mortgages any prepayments will be reinvested at the thenprevailing interest rate although gnma certificates may offer yields higher than those available from other types of us government securities gnma certificates may be less effective than other types of securities as a means of locking in attractive longterm rates because of the prepayment feature due to this prepayment feature gnma certificates tend not to increase in value as much as most other debt securities when interest rates decline illiquid securitiesilliquid securities are securities which cannot be disposed of within seven business days at approximately the price at which they are being carried on a funds books illiquid securities include demand instruments with demand notice periods exceeding seven days securities for which there is no active secondary market and repurchase agreements with maturities of more than seven days in length municipal securitiesthe prime obligation and money market funds may invest in municipal securities the two principal classifications of municipal securities are general obligation and revenue issues general obligation issues are issues involving the credit of an issuer possessing taxing power and are payable from the issuers general unrestricted revenues although the characteristics and method of enforcement of general obligation issues may vary according to the law applicable to the particular issuer revenue issues are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or other specific revenue source a fund may also invest in moral obligation issues which are normally issued by special purpose authorities moral obligation issues are not backed by the full faith and credit of the state but are generally backed by the agreement of the issuing authority to request appropriations from the state legislative body municipal securities include debt obligations issued by governmental entities to obtain funds for various public purposes such as the construction of a wide range of public facilities the refunding of outstanding obligations the payment of general operating expenses and the extension of loans to other public institutions and facilities certain private activity bonds that are issued by or on behalf of public authorities to finance various privatelyowned or operated facilities are included within the term municipal securities private activity bonds and industrial development bonds are generally revenue bonds the credit and quality of which are directly related to the credit of the private user of the facilities municipal securities may also include general obligation notes tax anticipation notes bond anticipation notes revenue anticipation notes project notes certificates of indebtedness demand notes taxexempt commercial paper construction loan notes and other forms of shortterm taxexempt loans such instruments are issued with a shortterm maturity in anticipation of the receipt of tax funds the proceeds of bond placements or other revenues project notes are issued by a state or local housing agency and are sold by the department of housing and urban development while the issuing agency has the primary obligation with respect to its project notes they are also secured by the full faith and credit of the united states through agreements with the issuing authority which provide that if required the federal government will lend the issuer an amount equal to the principal of and interest on the project notes s the quality of municipal securities both within a particular classification and between classifications will vary and the yields on municipal securities depend upon a variety of factors including general money market conditions the financial condition of the issuer or other entity whose financial resources are supporting the securities general conditions of the municipal bond market the size of a particular offering the maturity of the obligation and the ratings of the issue in this regard it should be emphasized that the ratings of any nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro are general and are not absolute standards of quality municipal securities with the same maturity interest rate and ratings may have different yields while municipal securities of the same maturity and interest rate with different ratings may have the same yield an issuers obligations under its municipal securities are subject to the provisions of bankruptcy insolvency and other laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors such as the federal bankruptcy code and laws if any which may be enacted by congress or state legislatures extending the time for payment of principal or interest or both or imposing other constraints upon the enforcement of such obligations or upon the ability of municipalities to levy taxes the power or ability of an issuer to meet its obligations for the payment of interest on and principal of its municipal securities may be materially adversely affected by litigation or other conditions municipal and corporate bond ratingsbonds rated aaa have the highest rating sp assigns to a debt obligation such a rating indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and interest bonds rate aa also qualify as highquality debt obligations capacity to pay principal and interest is very strong and in the majority of instances they differ from aaa issues only in small degree bonds which are rated aaa by moodys are judged to be the best quality they carry the smallest degree of credit risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues bonds rated aa are judged by moodys to be of high quality by all standards together with bonds rated aaa they comprise what are generally known as highgrade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities bonds rated aaa are judged by fitch to be strictly high grade broadly marketable suitable for investment by trustees and fiduciary institutions liable to but slight market fluctuation other than through changes in the money rate the prime feature of an aaa bond is a showing of earnings several times or many times interest requirements with such stability of applicable earnings that safety is beyond reasonable question whatever changes occur in conditions bonds rated aa are judged by fitch to be of safety virtually beyond question and are readily salable whose merits are not unlike those of the aaa class but whose margin of safety is less strikingly broad the issue may be the obligation of a small company strongly secured but influenced as to rating by the lesser financial power of the enterprise and more local type market bonds rated duff are judged by duff to be of the highest credit quality with negligible risk factors only slightly more than us treasury debt bonds rated duff are judged by duff to be of high credit quality with strong protection factors risk is modest but may vary slightly from time to time because of economic conditions bonds which are rated aaa are judged by thomson to be of the highest category the ability to repay principal and interest on a timely basis is very high bonds rated aa are judged by thomson to be of a superior ability to repay principal and interest on a timely basis with limited incremental risk compared to issues rated in the highest category s obligations rated aaa by ibca have the lowest expectation of investment risk capacity for timely repayment of principal and interest is substantial such that adverse changes in business economic or financial conditions are unlikely to increase investment risk significantly obligations for which there is a very low expectation of investment risk are rated aa by ibca capacity for timely repayment of principal and interest is substantial adverse changes in business economic or financial conditions may increase investment risk albeit not very significantly municipal note ratingsmoodys highest rating for state and municipal and other shortterm notes is mig and vmig shortterm municipal securities rated mig or vmig are of the best quality and such securities have strong protection afforded by established cash flows superior liquidity support andor demonstrated access to the market for refinancing shortterm municipal securities rated mig and vmig are of high quality and their margins of protection are ample although not so large as in the preceding group an sp note rating reflects the liquidity concerns and market access risks unique to notes notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note rating notes maturing beyond three years will most likely receive a longterm debt rating the following criteria will be used in making that assessment  amortization schedule the larger the final maturity relative to other maturities the more likely it will be treated as a note  source of payment the more dependent the issue is on the market for its refinancing the more likely it will be treated as a note note rate symbols are as follows sp very strong or strong capacity to pay principal and interest those issues determined to possess overwhelming safety characteristics will be given a plus  designation sp satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest repurchase agreementsthe treasury securities government securities prime obligation and money market funds may enter into repurchase agreements which are agreements under which securities are acquired from a securities dealer or bank subject to resale on an agreed upon date and at an agreed upon price which includes principal and interest the fund involved bears a risk of loss in the event that the other party to a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations and the fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the securities held as collateral wellington management company llp the adviser enters into repurchase agreements only with financial institutions which it deems to present minimal risk of bankruptcy during the term of the agreement based on guidelines established by and periodically reviewed by the board of trustees these guidelines currently permit the funds to enter into repurchase agreements only with approved banks and primary securities dealers as recognized by the federal reserve bank of new york which have minimum net capital of  million or with a member bank of the federal reserve system repurchase agreements are considered to be loans collateralized by the underlying security repurchase agreements entered into by the funds will provide that the underlying security at all times shall have a value at least equal to  of the price stated in the agreement this underlying security will be marked to market daily the adviser monitors compliance with this requirement under all repurchase agreements entered into by the funds the funds will take actual or constructive possession of the underlying collateral however if the seller defaults the funds could realize a loss on the sale of the underlying security to the extent the proceeds of the sale are less than the resale price in addition even though the bankruptcy code provides protection for most repurchase agreements if the seller should be involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings the funds may incur delay and costs in selling the security and may suffer a loss of principal and interest if the funds are treated as an unsecured creditor repurchase agreements are considered loans under the  act s restricted securitiesrestricted securities are securities that may not be sold freely to the public absent registration under the securities act of  or an exemption from registration rule a securities are securities that have not been registered under the securities act of  but which may be traded between certain institutional investors including investment companies the trusts board of trustees is

banks federal home loan mortgage corporation federal intermediate credit banks federal land banks fannie mae and the united states postal service some of these securities are supported by the full faith and credit of the united states treasury eg gnma securities others in which all funds permitted to invest in agencies securities may invest are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the treasury and still others are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality eg fannie mae securities guarantees of principal by agencies or instrumentalities of the us government may be a guarantee of payment at the maturity of the obligation so that in the event of a default prior to maturity there might not be a market and thus no means of realizing the value of the obligation prior to maturity guarantees as to the timely payment of principal and interest do not extend to the value or yield of these securities nor to the value of the funds shares the funds do not intend to purchase securities issued by the world bank the interamerican development bank or the asian development bank us treasury obligationsus treasury obligations consist of bills notes and bonds issued by the us treasury as well as separately traded interest and principal component parts of such obligations known as separately traded registered interest and principal securities strips that are transferable through the federal bookentry system us treasury stripsus treasury strips are sold as zero coupon securities which means that they are sold at a substantial discount and redeemed at face value at their maturity date without interim cash payments of interest or principal this discount is accreted over the life of the security and such accretion will constitute the income earned on the security for both accounting and tax purposes because of these features such securities may be subject to greater interest rate volatility than interestpaying investments variable or floating rate instrumentscertain of the funds may invest in variable or floating rate instruments these securities may involve a demand feature and may include variable amount master demand notes that may be backed

pursuant to a written agreement between the issuer and the holder its amount may be increased by the holder or decreased by the holder or issuer it is payable on demand and the rate of interest varies based upon an agreed formula the quality of the underlying credit must in the opinion of the adviser be equivalent to the longterm bond or commercial paper ratings applicable to the funds permitted investments the adviser will monitor on an ongoing basis the earning power cash flow s and liquidity ratios of the issuers of such instruments and will similarly monitor the ability of an issuer of a demand instrument to pay principal and interest on demand whenissued securitieseach fund may invest in whenissued securities these securities involve the purchase of debt obligations on a whenissued

with the intention of actually acquiring the securities but may sell them before the settlement date whenissued securities are subject to market fluctuation and no interest accrues to the purchaser during the period prior to settlement the payment obligation and the interest rate that a fund will receive on the securities are each fixed at the time the fund enters into the commitment purchasing obligations on a whenissued basis is a form of leveraging and can involve a risk that the yields available in the market when delivery takes place may actually be higher than those obtained in the

historical earnings and are not intended to indicate future performance the current yield of each fund is calculated daily based upon the seven days ending on the date of calculation base period the yield is computed by determining the net change exclusive of capital changes in the value of a hypothetical preexisting shareholder account having a balance of one share at the beginning of the period subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from shareholder accounts and dividing such net change by the value of the account at the beginning of the same period to obtain the base period return and multiplying the result by  realized and unrealized gains and losses are not included in the calculation of the yield the funds compute their effective compound yield by determining the net changes exclusive of capital changes in the value of a hypothetical preexisting account having a balance of one share at the beginning of the period subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from shareholder accounts and dividing the difference by the value of the account at the beginning of the base period to obtain the base period return and then compounding the base period return by adding  raising the sum to a power equal to  divided by  and subtracting  from the result according to the following formula effective yield  base period return     the current and the effective yields reflect the reinvestment of net income earned daily on portfolio assets s actual yields will depend on such variables as asset quality average asset maturity the type of instruments a fund invests in changes in interest rates on money market instruments changes in the expenses of the funds and other factors yields are one basis upon which investors may compare the funds with other money market funds however yields of other money market mutual funds and other investment vehicles may not be comparable because of the factors set forth above and differences in the methods used in valuing portfolio instruments for the sevenday period ended june   the funds yield and effective yield were as follows fund class current effective     treasury securities class a   class d   government securities class a   prime obligation class a   institutional cash class a   money market class a    not in operation during such period the total return of a fund refers to the average compounded rate of return for a hypothetical investment for designated time periods including but not limited to the period from which the fund commenced operations through the specified date assuming that the entire investment is redeemed at the end of each period in particular total return will be calculated according to the following formula p  t to the power of n  erv where p  a hypothetical initial payment of  t  average annual total return n  number of years and erv  ending redeemable value of a hypothetical  payment made at the beginning of the designated time period as of the end of such period based on the foregoing the average annual total returns for the funds from inception through june   and for the one five and ten year periods ended june   were as follows average annual total return  since fund class one year five year ten year inception       treasury securities class a     class d     government securities class a     prime obligation class a     institutional cash class a     money market class a      not in operation during such period  although the fund originally commenced operations on december   it was only open to shareholders for a few days each year the fund was closed on january   determination of net asset value securities of the funds will be valued by the amortized cost method which involves valuing a security at its cost on the date of purchase and thereafter absent unusual circumstances assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium regardless of the impact of fluctuations in general market rates of interest on the value of the instrument while this method provides certainty in valuation it may result in periods during which value as determined by this method is higher or lower than the price a fund would receive if it sold the instrument during periods of declining interest rates the daily yield of a fund may tend to be higher than a like computation made by a company with identical investments s utilizing a method of valuation based upon market prices and estimates of market prices for all of its portfolio securities thus if the use of amortized cost by the trust resulted in a lower aggregate portfolio value on a particular day a prospective investor in a fund would be able to obtain a somewhat higher yield than would result from investment in a company utilizing solely market values and existing shareholders in the fund would experience a lower yield the converse would apply in a period of rising interest rates the trusts use of amortized cost valuation and the maintenance of the net asset value of each fund at  are permitted by rule a under the  act provided that certain conditions are met under rule a a money market portfolio must maintain a dollarweighted average maturity in the fund of  days or less and not purchase any instrument having a remaining maturity of more than  days in addition money market funds may acquire only us dollar denominated obligations that present minimal credit risks and that are eligible securities which means they are i rated at the time of investment by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations one if it is the only organization rating such obligation in the highest shortterm rating category or if unrated determined to be of comparable quality a first tier security or ii rated according to the foregoing criteria in the second highest shortterm rating category or if unrated determined to be of comparable quality second tier security the adviser will determine that an obligation presents minimal credit risks or that unrated instruments are of comparable quality in accordance with guidelines established by the trustees the trustees must approve or ratify the purchase of any unrated securities in addition investments in second tier securities are subject to the further constraints that i no more than  of a funds assets may be invested in such securities in the aggregate and ii any investment in such securities of one issuer is limited to the greater of  of the funds total assets or  million the regulations also require the trustees to establish procedures which are reasonably designed to stabilize the net asset value per unit at  for each fund however there is no assurance that the trust will be able to meet this objective the trusts procedures include the determination of the extent of deviation if any of each funds current net asset value per unit calculated using available market quotations from each funds amortized cost price per unit at such intervals as the trustees deem appropriate and reasonable in light of market conditions and periodic reviews of the amount of the deviation and the methods used to calculate such deviation in the event that such deviation exceeds  of  the trustees are required to consider promptly what action if any should be initiated and if the trustees believe that the extent of any deviation may result in material dilution or other unfair results to shareholders the trustees are required to take such corrective action as they deem appropriate to eliminate or reduce such dilution or unfair results to the extent reasonably practicable in addition if any fund incurs a significant loss or liability the trustees have the authority to reduce pro rata the number of shares of that fund in each shareholders account and to offset each shareholders pro rata portion of such loss or liability from the shareholders accrued but unpaid dividends or from future dividends purchase and redemption of shares purchases and redemptions of shares of the funds may be made on any day the new york stock exchange is open for business currently the following holidays are observed by the trust new years day martin luther king jr day presidents day good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day it is currently the trusts policy to pay all redemptions in cash the trust retains the right however to alter this policy to provide for redemptions in whole or in part by a distribution in kind of readily marketable securities held by a fund in lieu of cash shareholders may incur brokerage charges on the sale of any such securities so received in payment of redemptions however a shareholder will at all times be entitled to aggregate cash redemptions from all portfolios of the trust during any day period of up to the lesser of  or  of the trusts net assets a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes may be realized by a taxable shareholder upon an inkind redemption depending upon the shareholders basis in the shares of the trust redeemed s the trust reserves the right to suspend the right of redemption andor to postpone the date of payment upon redemption for any period during which trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted or during the existence of an emergency as determined by the sec by rule or regulation as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the portfolio securities is not reasonably practicable or for such other periods as the sec may by order permit the trust also reserves the right to suspend sales of shares of the fund for any period during which the new york stock exchange the manager the adviser the distributor andor the custodian are not open for business shareholder services class d shares stoppayment requests investors may request a stop payment on checks by providing the trust with a written authorization to do so oral requests will be accepted provided that the trust promptly receives a written authorization such requests will remain in effect for six months unless renewed or canceled the trust will use its best efforts to effect stoppayment instructions but does not promise or guarantee that such instructions will be effective shareholders requesting stop payment will be charged a  service fee per check which will be deducted from their accounts right of accumulation a shareholder qualifies for cumulative quantity discounts when his new investment together with the current market value of all holdings of that shareholder in certain eligible funds reaches a discount level see purchase and redemption of shares in the prospectuses for the sales charge on quantity purchases letter of intent the reduced sales shares are also applicable to the aggregate amount of purchases made by any such purchaser previously enumerated within a month period pursuant to a written letter of intent provided by the distributor and not legally binding on the signer or a fund which provides for the holder in escrow by the manager of  of the total amount intended to be purchased until such purchase is completed within the month period a letter of intent may be dated to include shares purchased up to  days prior to the date of the letter of intent is signed the month period begins on the date of the earliest purchase if the intended investment is not completed the manager will surrender an appropriate number of the escrowed shares for redemption distribution investment option distributions of dividends and capital gains made by the funds may be automatically invested in shares of one of the funds if shares of the fund are available for sale such investments will be subject to initial investment minimums as well as additional purchase minimums a shareholder considering the distribution investment option should obtain and read the prospectus of the funds andor classes in which such automatic investments are to be made and consider the differences in investment objectives and policies before making any investment reinstatement privilege a shareholder who has redeemed shares of any of the funds has a onetime right to reinvest the redemption proceeds in shares of the fund at their net asset value as of the time of reinvestment such a reinvestment must be made within  days of the redemption and is limited to the amount of the redemption proceeds although redemptions and repurchases of shares are taxable events a reinvestment within such day period in the same fund is considered a wash sale and results in the inability to recognize currently all or a portion of a loss realized on the original redemption for federal income tax purposes the investor must notify the transfer agent at the time the trade is placed that the transaction is a reinvestment exchange privilege some or all of the shares of the fund for which payment has been received ie an established account may be exchanged at their net asset value plus any applicable sales charge for class d shares of the trust sei tax exempt trust sei institutional international trust and sei institutional managed trust or at their net asset value for class d shares of other funds of such trusts that do not have sales charges exchanges will be made only after proper instructions in writing or by telephone an exchange request are received for an established account by the distributor s a shareholder may exchange a funds class d shares for which good payment has been received in his account at any time regardless of how long he has held his shares each exchange request must be in proper form ie if in writing signed by the record owners exactly as the shares are registered if by telephone proper account identification is given by the dealer or shareholder of record and each exchange must involve either shares having an aggregate value of at least  or all the shares in the account each exchange involves the redemption of the shares of a fund to be exchanged and the purchase of the shares of the other fund any gain or loss on the redemption of the shares exchanged is reportable on the shareholders federal income tax return unless such shares were held in a taxdeferred retirement plan or other taxexempt account if the exchange request is received by the distributor in writing or by telephone on any business day as defined in the prospectuses of the trust prior to the close of the new york stock exchange the exchange will be effective on that day if all the restrictions set forth above have been complied with at that time however payment of the redemption proceeds by the funds and thus the purchase of shares of the other funds may be delayed for up to seven days if the funds determine that such delay would be in the best interest of all of its shareholders investment dealers which have satisfied criteria established by the funds may also communicate a shareholders exchange request to the funds subject to the restrictions set forth above no more than five exchange requests may be made in any one telephone exchange request taxes the following is only a summary of certain additional federal tax considerations generally affecting the funds and their shareholders that are not described in the funds prospectuses no attempt is made to present a detailed explanation of the federal state or local tax treatment of the funds or their shareholders and the discussion here and in the funds prospectuses is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning federal income taxes the following discussion of federal income tax consequences is based on the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and the regulations issued thereunder as in effect on the date of this statement of additional information new legislation as well as administrative changes or court decisions may significantly change the conclusions expressed herein and may have a retroactive effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein each fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company ric as defined under subchapter m of the code by following such a policy each of the funds expects to eliminate or reduce to a nominal amount the federal income taxes to which such fund may be subject in order to qualify for treatment as a ric a fund must distribute annually to its shareholders at least the sum of  of its net interest income excludable from gross income plus  of its investment company taxable income generally net investment income plus the excess of net shortterm capital gain over net longterm capital loss the distribution requirement and also must meet several additional requirements among these requirements are the following i at least  of a funds gross income each taxable year must be derived from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities on foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock or securities ii at the close of each quarter of a funds taxable year at least  of the value of its total assets must be represented by cash and cash items us government securities securities of other rics and other securities with such other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount that does not exceed  of the value of a funds assets and that does not represent more than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and iii at the close of each quarter of a funds taxable year not more than  of the value of its assets may be invested in securities other than us government securities or the securities of other rics of any one issuer or of s two or more issuers which are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses if the fund owns at least  of the voting power of such issuers notwithstanding the distribution requirement described above which only requires a fund to distribute at least  of its annual investment company taxable income and does not require any minimum distribution of net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss a fund will be subject to a nondeductible  federal excise tax to the extent it fails to distribute by the end of any calendar year at least  of its ordinary income for that year and  of its capital gain net income the excess of short and longterm capital gains over short and longterm capital losses for the oneyear period ending on october  of that year plus certain other amounts each fund intends to make sufficient distributions to avoid liability for the federal excise tax a fund may in certain circumstances be required to liquidate fund investments in order to make sufficient distributions to avoid federal excise tax liability at a time when the investment advisor might not otherwise have chosen to do so and liquidation of investments in such circumstances may affect the ability of a fund to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a ric any gain or loss recognized on a sale exchange or redemption of shares of a fund by a shareholder who is not a dealer in securities will generally for individual shareholders be treated as a longterm capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than twelve months and otherwise will be treated as shortterm capital gain or loss however if shares on which a shareholder has received a net capital gain distribution are subsequently sold exchanged or redeemed and such shares have been held for six months or less any loss recognized will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent of the net capital gain distribution longterm capital gains are currently taxed at a maximum rate of  and shortterm capital gains are currently taxed at ordinary income tax rates if a fund fails to qualify as a ric for any year all of its taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders and its distributions including capital gains distributions generally will be taxable as ordinary income dividends to its shareholders subject to the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders a fund will be required in certain cases to withhold and remit to the united states treasury  of amounts payable to any shareholder who  has provided the fund either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all  who is subject to backup withholding by the internal revenue service for failure to properly report such payments of interest or dividends or  who has failed to certify to the fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding state taxes a fund is not liable for any income or franchise tax in massachusetts if it qualifies as a ric for federal income tax purposes rules of state and local taxation of dividend and capital gains distributions from rics often differ from the rules for federal income taxation described above depending upon state and local law distributions by the fund to shareholders and the ownership of shares may be subject to state and local taxes shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the affect of federal state and local taxes in their own individual circumstances fund transactions the trust has no obligation to deal with any dealer or group of dealers in the execution of transactions in portfolio securities subject to policies established by the trustees the adviser is responsible for placing orders to execute fund transactions in placing orders it is the trusts policy to seek to obtain the best net results taking into account such factors as price including the applicable dealer spread size type and difficulty of the transaction involved the firms general execution and operational facilities and the firms risk in positioning the securities involved while the adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive spreads or commissions the trust will not necessarily be paying the lowest spread or commission available s the trusts policy of investing in securities with short maturities will result in high portfolio turnover the trust will not purchase portfolio securities from any affiliated person acting as principal except in conformity with the regulations of the securities and exchange commission it is expected that certain of the funds may execute brokerage or other agency transactions through the distributor a registered brokerdealer for a commission in conformity with the  act the securities exchange act of  and rules of the sec under these provisions the distributor is permitted to receive and retain compensation for effecting portfolio transactions for a fund on an exchange if a written contract is in effect between the distributor and the trust expressly permitting the distributor to receive and retain such compensation these provisions further require that commissions paid to the distributor by the trust for exchange transactions not exceed usual and customary brokerage commissions the rules define usual and customary commissions to include amounts which are reasonable and fair compared to the commission fee or other remuneration received or to be received by other brokers in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of time in addition the fund may direct commission business to one or more designated brokerdealers including the distributor in connection with such brokerdealers payment of certain of the funds expenses the trustees including those who are not interested persons of the trust have adopted procedures for evaluating the reasonableness of commissions paid to the distributor and will review these procedures periodically the trust does not expect to use one particular dealer but subject to the trusts policy of seeking the best net results dealers who provide supplemental investment research to the adviser may receive orders for transactions by the trust information so received will be in addition to and not in lieu of the services required to be performed by the adviser under the advisory agreements and the expenses of the adviser will not necessarily be reduced as a result of the receipt of such supplemental information the money market securities in which certain of the funds invest are traded primarily in the overthecounter market where possible the adviser will deal directly with the dealers who make a market in the securities involved except in those circumstances where better prices and execution are available elsewhere such dealers usually are acting as principal for their own account on occasion securities may be purchased directly from the issuer money market securities generally are traded on a net basis and normally do not involve either brokerage commissions or transfer taxes the cost of executing portfolio securities transactions of the funds will primarily consist of dealer spreads and underwriting commissions since the trust does not market its shares through intermediary brokers or dealers it is not the trusts practice to allocate brokerage or principal business on the basis of sales of its shares which may be made through such firms however the adviser may place fund orders with qualified brokerdealers who recommend the trust to clients and may when a number of brokers and dealers can provide best price and execution on a particular transaction consider such recommendations by a broker or dealer in selecting among brokerdealers the trust is required to identify any securities of its regular brokers or dealers as such term is defined in the  act which the trust has acquired during its most recent fiscal year for the trusts fiscal years ended june    and  no brokerage fees were paid description of shares the declaration of trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number of shares of each fund each of which represents an equal proportionate interest in that fund each share of a fund upon liquidation of that fund entitles a shareholder to a pro rata share in the net assets of that fund after taking into account certain distribution expenses shareholders have no preemptive rights the declaration of trust provides that the trustees of the trust may create additional portfolio of shares or classes of portfolio any consideration received by the trust for shares of any additional fund and assets in which such consideration is invested would belong to that fund and would be subject to the liabilities related thereto share certificates representing the shares will not be issued s limitation of trustees liability the declaration of trust provides that a trustee shall be liable only for his own willful defaults and if reasonable care has been exercised in the selection of officers agents employees or administrators shall not be liable for any neglect or wrongdoing of any such person the declaration of trust also provides that the trust will indemnify its trustees and officers against liabilities and expenses incurred in connection with actual or threatened litigation in which they may be involved because of their offices with the trust unless it is determined in the manner provided in the declaration of trust that they have not acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that their actions were in the best interests of the trust however nothing in the declaration of trust shall protect or indemnify a trustee against any liability for his willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of his duties voting where the prospectuses for the funds or this statement of additional information state that an investment limitation or a fundamental policy may not be changed without shareholder approval such approval means the vote of i  or more of the funds shares present at a meeting if the holders of more than  of the outstanding shares of the fund are present or represented by proxy or ii more than  of the funds outstanding shares whichever is less shareholder liability the trust is an entity of the type commonly known as a massachusetts business trust under massachusetts law shareholders of the trust could under certain circumstances be held personally liable for the obligations of the trust however the possibility of the shareholders incurring financial loss appears remote because the trusts declaration of trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for obligations of the trust and requires that notice of such disclaimer be given in each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by or on behalf of the trust or the trustees the declaration of trust provides for indemnification out of the trusts property for any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the trust control persons and principal holders of securities as of october   the following persons were the only persons who were record

smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edged interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aa bonds rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they compare what are generally known as highgrade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risk appear somewhat larger than the aaa securities a bonds rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as uppermedium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment some time in the future baa bonds rated baa are considered as mediumgrade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate

the money rate the prime feature of an aaa bond is a showing of earnings several times or many times greater than interest requirements with such stability of applicable earnings that safety is beyond reasonable question whatever changes occur in conditions aa bonds rated aa are judged to be of safety virtually beyond question and are readily salable whose merits are not unlike those of the aaa class but whose margin of safety is less strikingly broad the issue may be the obligation of a small company strongly secured but influenced as to rating by the lesser financial power of the enterprise and more local type market a bonds rated a are considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be

satisfactory credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be adequate adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances however are more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds and therefore impair timely payment the likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings
