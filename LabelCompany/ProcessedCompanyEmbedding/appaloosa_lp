appaloosa  cd  a beautiful musical discovery that wed somehow never managed to hear all these years – the debut of and possibly only album by appaloosa a group who mix together gentle folk and a bit of strings – in a mode thats strongly resonant with some of tim hardin or tim buckleys best work of the late s as you can guess from the cover image the group is pretty young – but they work with a timeless quality beyond their years a mode that mixes guitar violin and cello together as the core instrumentation for the tunes – topped by wonderful vocals from singer robin batteau who has one of those shoulda been huge voices that really grab you right away al kooper produced and contributed some instrumentation – but in a really subtle way that respects the bands sound strongly – and titles include pascals paradox now that i want you georgia street rosalie rivers run to the sea glossolalia and feathers  sound stereo pressing – with insert cover has a cut corner and some surface wear    dusty groove inc very good vinyl can have some dirt but nothing major may not shine under light but should still be pretty clean and not too dirty may have a number of marks  to  at most and obvious signs of play but never a big cluster of them or any major mark that would be very deep most marks should still not click under a fingernail may not look near perfect but should play fairly well with slight surface noise and the occasional click in part of a song but never throughout a whole song or more this is clearly a copy that was played by someone a number of times but which could also be a good play copy for someone new additional marks  notes if something is noteworthy we try to note it in the comments — especially if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record this might include but isnt limited to warped records tracks that skip cover damage or wear as noted above or strictly cosmetic flaws you might be interested santana abraxas columbia  very good gatefold lp

appaloosacolumbiacolumbia labelrock cd lp also available appaloosa — appaloosa  lp  a beautiful musical discovery that wed somehow never managed to hear all these years – the debut of and possibly only album by appaloosa a group who mix together gentle folk and a bit of strings – in a mode thats strongly resonant with some of tim hardin or tim buckleys best work of the late s as you can guess from the cover image the group is pretty young – but they work with a timeless quality beyond their years a mode that mixes guitar violin and cello together as the core instrumentation for the tunes – topped by wonderful vocals from singer robin batteau who has one of those shoulda been huge voices that really grab you right away al kooper produced and contributed some instrumentation – but in a really subtle way that respects the bands sound strongly – and titles include pascals paradox now that i want you georgia street rosalie rivers run to the sea glossolalia and feathers    dusty groove inc we realize that there are many different interpretations of the standard grades used for preowned vinyl record albums  cd so we thought wed offer you the ones that we are working with so you have an idea what we mean when we give the grade for a nonnew item on our pages used vinyl grades below are stated conditions for a used vinyl records at dusty groove grading for the cover should be assumed to be near within a  or  the grading for the vinyl if there is significant divergence from the condition of the vinyl or specific flaws these will be noted in the comments section of the item however please be aware that since the emphasis of this site is towards the music listener our main concern is with the vinyl of any used item we sell additionally please note that all of our records are graded visually considering the volume of used vinyl we handle it is impossible for us to listen to each record if we spot any significant flaws we make every attempt to listen through them and note how they play the following grading conditions apply to the vinyl component of an album or single sealed this is what it says that the record is still held fast in shrinkwrap we tend to be pretty suspicious about these things so if the shrinkwrap doesnt look original or if the record seems to have undergone some damage over time well probably take it out of the wrapper to ensure that its in good shape — which is why we dont have more of these in some cases the shrinkwrap may be torn in spots but if its not possible the record has been taken out and played the record will still qualify as sealed near mint dusty groove does not use the grades of near mint or mint for that matter because in our experience we find that no records ever qualify for such a high grade even sealed records tend to have one or two slight faults enough to usually qualify them for a grade of nm or lower weve often found that records which are clearly unplayed will have a slight amount of surface noise especially in quieter recordings near mint  minus black vinyl that may show a slight amount of dust or dirt should still be very shiny under a light even with slight amount of dust on surface one or two small marks that would make an otherwise near perfect record slightly less so these marks cannot be too deep and should only be surface marks that wont affect play but might detract from the looks may have some flaws and discoloration in the vinyl but only those that would be intrinsic to the pressing these should disappear when the record is tilted under the light and will only show up when looking straight at the record buddah and abc pressings from the s are a good example of this may have some slight marks from aging of the paper sleeve on the vinyl possible minor surface noise when played very good  plus vinyl should be very clean but can have less luster than near mint should still shine under a light but one or two marks may show up when tilted can have a few small marks that may show up easily but which do not affect play at all most marks of this quality will disappear when the record is tilted and will not be felt with the back of a fingernail this is the kind of record that will play near mint but which will have some signs of use although not major ones may have slight surface noise when played very good vinyl can have some dirt but nothing major may not shine under light but should still be pretty clean and not too dirty may have a number of marks  to  at most and obvious signs of play but never a big cluster of them or any major mark that would be very deep most marks should still not click under a fingernail may not look near perfect but should play fairly well with slight surface noise and the occasional click in part of a song but never throughout a whole song or more this is clearly a copy that was played by someone a number of times but which could also be a good play copy for someone new very good  minus vinyl may be dirty and can lack a fair amount of luster vinyl can have a number of marks either in clusters or smaller amounts but deeper this is the kind of record that youd buy to play but not because it looked that great still the flaws should be mostly cosmetic with nothing too deep that would ruin the overall record examples include a record that has been kept for a while in a cover without the paper sleeve or heavily played by a previous owner and has some marks across the surface the record should play okay though probably with surface noise good  plus vinyl may be dirty or have one outstanding flaw such as a light residue which could be difficult to clean may have marks on all parts too many to qualify as very good or several deeper marks but the record should still be ok for play without skips in general this is a record that was played a fair amount and handled without care a typical example may be a record which has been heavily played by a dj and carries marks from slip cueing depending on the quality of the vinyl may play with surface noise throughout good a record that youd buy to play cheap but which you wouldnt buy for collecting will have marks across all parts of the playing surface and will most likely play with surface noise throughout may have some other significant flaws such as residue or a track that skips in most cases a poor quality copy of a very difficult to find record fair this is a grade we rarely use as we try not to sell records in very bad condition though in some rare cases we will list a record in such bad shape that it does not conform to the standards above a fair record will have enough marks or significant flaws that it does not even qualify as good but is a copy you might consider for playing if youre willing to put up with noise andor flaws an example might be a recording with surface noise so heavy that it is equal to the volume of the music for records listed as fair we will describe the extent of the condition in the comments poor like fair we rarely list records in this condition as they represent the extreme low end of spectrum these records typically have multiple serious problems and we offer them as relics or objects only — for those who want to at least have a copy of a record even if it is not really worthy of play perhaps for the cover alone for these records we will describe the extent of the condition in the comments additional marks  notes if something is noteworthy we try to note it in the comments — especially if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record this might include but isnt limited to warped records tracks that skip cover damage or wear as noted above or strictly cosmetic flaws used cd grade we have only one grade for nonnew cds at dusty groove — used cd this grade is somewhat allencompassing but we choose it because we try to offer used cds in the best shape possible all of our used cds are guaranteed to play without skipping or flaws if you purchase a used cd from dusty groove you have  week to play it to determine that it plays correctly — and if it does not then you may return it for a full refund with our used cds you can expect the disc to be free of all but the lightest of surface marks — clean and not dirty at all you can also expect the case to be clean we often change the cases ourselves — putting fresh cases on used cds we handle — and you can expect the booklet to be in good shape unless noted otherwise we will list any specific detailsdefects underneath the item — so look for notes on cutout marks in the case stamps on the barcode or
