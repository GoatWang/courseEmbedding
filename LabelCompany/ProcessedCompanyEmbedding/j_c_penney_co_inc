foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search how jc penney company inc makes most of its money despite efforts to change the retailer is still overly reliant on apparel and brickandmortar sales jeremy bowman tmfhobo jun   at am jc penney nysejcp is not the same company it was  years ago the department store chain has diversified into new categories partnering with beauty brands like sephora and instyle hair salons expanding its home offerings with branded flooring featuring more window treatments and now selling appliances for the first time in more than  years ceo marvin ellison who spent much of his career with home depot has made the home division a particular focus of his strategy  that category has seen continued growth despite broader retail problems since its protected from ecommerce  image source jc penney however despite those efforts to diversify the companys biggest and most important product category remains womens apparel seventy percent of the companys customers are women and the majority of the store is still devoted to apparel twentyfour percent of the companys sales come from womens apparel  comparable sales in womens apparel have recently fallen countering growth in areas like home and sephora in the last quarter overall comparable sales dropped  while performance in womens apparel was even worse jc penney does not break down sales by product category but ellison was not optimistic about a return to growth in womens apparel anytime soon problems have persisted in spite of the companys launching several private labels including boutique for plussize womens fashion and fastfashion takeoff belle  sky among others   mallbased apparel retailers in general have struggled lately as they face intensifying competition from fastfashion retailers like hm and uniqlo and the ecommerce channel where amazoncom has made apparel an increasing focus a number have announced store closings apparel prices have also remained flat over the last generation as competition has risen and commodity prices have fallen without an improved fashion lineup jc penney is likely to continue to struggle in the womens apparel segment as the headwinds against it are numerous the digital divide like other department stores and brickandmortar chains penney has invested significantly in its ecommerce platform ellison has touted the companys buyonlinepickup in store program and improvements to its mobile app on recent earnings calls competing online has become crucial as overall ecommerce is growing by  annually while brickandmortar apparel sales shrink  the retailer no longer directly reports online sales as its omnichannel strategy blends online and offline sales with programs like pickup in store and the vast majority of online sales still involve physical locations  the companys footprint is key in implementing its ecommerce strategy still based on estimates from prior years the retailer makes about  billion on sales through its website and app or a little more than  of total revenue fellow department store chain nordstrom nysejwn generates about  of its sales through ecommerce but such a discrepancy is to be expected as nordstrom has a more upscale clientele as jc penney closes more stores the percentage of sales going to the online channel will likely grow though the company has said that closing stores leads to a decline in online sales in the surrounding area department stores are in trouble for a reason and jc penney is no different even after all the efforts and initiatives to bring customers back after the debacle under ron johnson the retailer is only borderline profitable and its guidance this year includes a questionable gain from the sale of a distribution facility without that sale management would have been forced to slash guidance the company needs to refresh its fashion lineup accelerate its diversification away from apparel and bolster its omnichannel strategy to compete with amazon and other rivals it wont be easy but shuttering stores is not a viable longterm strategy though it may be necessary above all management needs to stabilize comparable store sales which continue to fall in spite of guidance predicting otherwise if that key figure continues to fall expect the stock to slide along with it   jeremy bowman owns
