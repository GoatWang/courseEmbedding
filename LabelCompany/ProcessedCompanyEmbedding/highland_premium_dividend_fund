highland capital management or any of its affiliates premiumdiscount to nav as of ticker nav close bidask mid pt premiumdiscount quarter explanation of premiumdiscount premium is when an etf’s market price selling or purchase price is greater than its calculated nav so when the etf’s price is above the nav the etf is said to trade at a “premium” – the etf is trading higher than what the underlying holdings are worth discount is when an etf’s market price selling or purchase price is less than its calculated nav so when the etf’s price is lower than the nav the etf is said to be at a “discount” – the etf is valued less than the fund’s overall holdings shareholders may pay more than net asset value when they buy fund shares and receive less than net asset value when they sell those shares because shares are bought and sold at current market prices the premiumdiscount chart demonstrates the difference between the daily market price of shares of the fund and the funds net asset value nav the daily market price is calculated using the midpoint price which is the midpoint between the ask price and the bid price at the time the nav is calculated generally  pm eastern time the vertical axis of the chart shows the premium or discount of the midpoint price as a percentage of the nav the horizontal axis shows the number of trading days covered by the chart and each bar in the chart demonstrates how many days the fund traded within the given premiumdiscount range the data presented in the chart and table above represent past performance and cannot be used to predict future
