on imprimis pharmaceuticals inc acquires intellectual property assets from buderer drug company imprimis pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq immy today announced it has completed the acquisition of intellectual property ip rights related to certain proprietary innovations from the compounding pharmacy operations of ohiobased buderer drug company the acquisition allows imprimis to pursue the commercial development of these proprietary innovations and also provides imprimis with a right of first refusal on additional buderer drug company intellectual property and drug development opportunities buderer drug company which has served the needs of patients and physicians in ohio since  is a compounding pharmacy member of pcca this ip acquisition is the first to emerge from the imprimispcca relationship “buderer drug company is a leading compounding pharmacy organization in the united states and we are extremely pleased to announce this asset purchase” said mark l baum imprimis ceo “this new relationship which could lead to up to three new development programs is a good example of our plan to begin to leverage our agreement with pcca into proprietary ip that may ultimately lead to the fda approval of new medicines to address unmet patient needs we are in the process of preparing filings with the uspto related to the acquired assets and intend to communicate with the marketplace with more specificity in the nearterm ultimately we intend to develop and commercialize any drug development assets we decide to pursue by utilizing the us food and drug administration fda b regulatory pathway the b pathway has the ability to significantly reduce both cost and duration of the fda approval process bringing quality medications more quickly to patients who need them” “we are excited at the potential development and commercialization prospects of our ideas we believe that imprimis understands and appreciates the important role of the compounding pharmacist in the healthcare system further imprimis understands that the ideas we generate come from a ‘boots on the ground’ approach – dealing directly with doctors and their patients to address specific and often unmet patient needs we also appreciate that some drugs are demonstrably difficult for compounders to make and that often times additional research and development is required before a drug can be used in humans including more formal preclinical and clinical research  we are looking forward to strengthening the bond between our companies and working toward bringing these medicines through the fda approval process and then to the marketplace where they can help people with a myriad of different medical conditions” said matt buderer rph vice president and chief compounding pharmacist with buderer drug company compounding pharmacies work with physicians to develop medications for individual patients examples are alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms such as topical creams or gels suspensions or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles access to these formulations may be limited if patients don’t live near a compounding pharmacy or cannot cover the outofpocket costs or if their physician is simply unaware of compounding options available to them baum said “commercialization of formulations developed by buderer drug company by taking them through a regulated fda process would in the long run allow more patients to benefit from these medications at the same time imprimis respects the rights of pharmacists and physicians to continue to serve their patients’ needs imprimis believes having an fdaapproved derivative of compounding’s innovations will enhance the overall acceptance of compounding and develop new opportunities for compounders to serve patients” gus bassani pharmd vice president of consulting rd and formulations with pcca and also an imprimis board member said “buderer drug company and its novel drug technologies are just one example of the depth of creativity and innovation possessed by pcca’s members we’ve desired to create a pathway for our members’ innovations that have commercial potential to get fda approval imprimis has developed this pathway for pcca pharmacy members and we hope to see more in the future” baum added “we will continue to be open to the ideas innovation and unique ‘proximity to the patient’ of the more than  compounding pharmacy members that are a part of the proprietary pcca network worldwide” about imprimis pharmaceuticals inc imprimis pharmaceuticals inc

american concerned with the integrity of the us public securities marketplace please accept this electronic message in support of an amendment to the rules affecting short position reporting by nasd member firms the cornerstone of the us securities market is transparency and fairness with greater transparency the listed companies financial institutions that finance these businesses and that buy and sell securities issued by these businesses as well as the existing and future shareholders of these companies will have the freedom to access critical information that can make or break an investment decision the bottom line is that in this day and age postenronworldcomtycoadelphiaaig � and so on how in the world can policymakers deny the marketplace information about chembio diagnostics inc an otc listed business that is available about microsoft a nasdaq listed business or any other nonotc listed company there is no issue in my recent memory that i believe if acted upon will help foster the kind of confidence and sense of market integrity that will lead to a more efficient productive and fair otc public securities marketplace i strongly urge you to make this rule
