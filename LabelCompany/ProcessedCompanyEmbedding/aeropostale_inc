presentation of the store eh the staff seem to generally be afraid of customers unless you approach them i feel like they just have their head down and are doing their own thing typically i dont mind i prefer to shop on my own but sometimes when i need help getting something or getting a fitting room theyre busy the fitting rooms are a bit of an issue theyre the ones that automatically lock so if they shut youre screwed dont bother waiting by that area to get a room just go up and ask them besides that the workers are generally nice if you talk to them while youre checking out theyre friendly but i feel like thats the only time i dont know maybe im expecting too much out of them blatant disrespectful and racist staff at this store i will never shop here again and am taking necessary steps to report my horrible experience not to mention the store looked a complete mess you are not greeted or asked if help is needed no organization or professionalism we love the deals and almost each time we enter any mall we make our way into this store bc of all the bargains however today the cashier slim blonde abrupt and indifferent was just the reflection of the rest of the customer service we had experienced throughout the mall good help really is hard to find i talked to the mgr rachelracquel and although she apologized profusely she didnt make any attempts to correct her employee also no one greeted us when we entered the store and no one endeavored to assist us and no one thanked usleast of all the inexperienced unrefined cashier her presence would be a detriment to any drivethru restaurant this place is awesome i just went here yesterday i love their bethany mota collection and all the rest of their clothes amazing service and very nice employees this is a must have store for teens and pre teens absolutely love this store great service and nice employees the prices are moderate and not too expensive cute accessories and tops the only negative thing i can say about this store would be the fragrances i dont really prefer the scents great service  all friendly staff and really fast at the cash wraps this team of assc are great they have the best deals and always have some great coupons going around so you could save even more also they take coupons off your phone you know some of us dont like carrying alot of coupons around lol my absolute favorite place to shop i shopped there so many times that all the managers knew me on a first name basis all of the staff is friendly and helpful and always makes sure to help you with what you need their clothes are more cost efficient than the other over priced stores i can shop here all year long and they always have a sale going on the clothes do run a bit smaller than others but still good quality i have had  of my sweaters from them for at least  years now and still wear them to death yes this store is geared more towards the younger crowd aeropostale is so awesome here at stoneridge i wouldnt go anywhere else to buy clothes from that co the clothes are pretty cheap and super cute all different styles colors designsabercrombie and hollister are like all blue and white and brown when you see it you know what i mean anyways good customer service the people are polite and available really fast too p after going to victorias secret or macys i go to aero and probably come out with a hoodie a tank top a few shirts or some shoes and a bag great selection one of my firsts filled w preteens and then some i cant lie that i shop here too id rather shop here than at af and hollister why its the same clothes for like  off the retail as the other stores gotta watch out because some of their shirts are irregular lucky i can wear whatever to work i love that they always have ff discounts good deal i

store is that the tshirts were buy  get  free today its a great sale i got the tshirts in maroon white and navy blue used their dressing room too they were fortunately no other people waiting for the dressing room great sale will be back again for the basics love their graphic and logo tees they are so light and there price are reasonable too lots of different colors and patterns they always hv something on sale i wish they would have more varieties sweat shirts and sweat pants  while i was in line to purchase my items there was this incredibly rude lady yelling at the employees yelling at them and shoving items towards them because she had to wait a couple minutes due to the long line and not to mention it looked short staffed that day anyways the employees kept their composure regardless of dealing with this incredibly rude customer i was still was greeted with a smile and positive attitude they definitely deserve  stars with dealing with the hordes of customers while maintaining a friendly and helpful attitude the service here is really bad they keep forgeting to get us coupons and the sunglasses we get every time we buy stuff for over  i saw the cashier as we were leaving taking the coupons for herself all the stuff here is way over marked prices that dont match the online prices the flip flop at the stores were  for onebut it also includes two free ones i thought this was a good deal too until i saw the real prices were only  a pair you might think that well  of the  flip flop are only  which is only a dollar less but at the store all the flip flops were  and theyre not even made with quality aeropostale shouldreally stop with teh bethony mota stuff i highly doubt she even design any of this stuff anymore all she does is model them all of the clothing from her line is a copycat of hollister abercrombie brandy melville cotton on and pac sun and forever  you can buy and find stuff like that for cheaper tooif not thereare stuff like that from higher quality places that may even cost more but is worth it the store should be cleaner and the workers be friendier and more helpful instead of bugging me when i dont need it and ignoreing me when i need help people are super friendly the manager was pretty helpful and they give a  discount for military and their families pretty cool in my book they messed up on my receipt discount but they were pretty apologetic it was a new kid on register so i didnt mind the wait i usually come in for tank tops and summer items they have pretty good sales why is this place listed as childrens clothing
