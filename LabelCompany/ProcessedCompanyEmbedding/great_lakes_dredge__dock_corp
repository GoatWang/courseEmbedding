product  anonymous user on  said good news it does remove weeds bad news is if the weeds are heavy the weeds pull the cord and this gets tangled in the chains it is difficult to anchor the system especially in deeper water was this comment helpful yes no  people found this comment helpful  did not  alena on  said it is such a pleasure to swim enjoying the nice sandy bottom of the lake vs prior to having the lakemaid we had to swim in the weeds the equipment is not difficult to install and once that is completed we can forget it and just watch the efficiency of the lakemaid i especially like the free standing unit and not having it attached to the dock the equipment is not heavy for installation and also stores nice for the winter was this comment helpful yes no  people found this comment helpful  did not  anonymous user on  said i am excited to write a review about lake restoration in the past i have purchased the lake maid which i enjoyed thoroughly also i have bought many supplies for my pond and my lake shore they always seem to be very educated on their products and more than willing to help you with any questions you might have  mark from st cloud mn was this comment helpful yes no  people found this comment helpful  did not  anonymous user on  said we were really excited to try this product so the unit twisted up no matter what you did making the cord cover way too short it got blown in no matter how heavy you made the anchor when it hit weeds even with the chains shortened it stopped turning  if its on a slope the chains are either too long or too short the finishing chains gouge deep channels in our case merely moving the silt over a bit the connections corroded after a couple of weeks making it very difficult to get apart or together we got the larger one it was quite expensive  has been just sitting in our back yard for the last  years we so wish we had not gone this route was this comment helpful yes no  people found this comment helpful  did not showing

regarding an ambiguity in the ifb provided a compelling basis for cancellationdecision great lakes dredge  dock company llc gldd of oak brook illinois protests the postbid opening cancellation of invitation for bids ifb no wsb which was issued by the department of the army corps of engineers for dredging services gldd contends that the corps did not have a compelling reason to cancel the solicitation and that as the lowest responsive bidder it should have been awarded the contract we deny the protest background the corps issued the ifb on august   which sought bids for an indefinitedelivery indefinitequantity idiq contract for dredging services with a base period of one year and one year option agency report ar at  the dredging was to be performed as required at the following locations between navigation miles  and  on the mcclellankerr arkansas river navigation system between navigation miles  and  on the white river and in harbors at rosedale and greenville mississippi ifb at  the ifb listed nine contract line item numbers clins for the base year and nine clins for the option year id at  as relevant here clin  was for mobilizationdemobilization services in the base year and clin  was for demobilization services for the option year id at   the ifb also incorporated the clause at defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars §  which provided that the agency would pay  percent of the lump sum price for mobilization and demobilization upon completion of the mobilization work and the remaining  percent upon completion of demobilization id at  the corps received bids from four firms gldd h construction inland dredging company llc and orion marine construction ar tab  bid evaluation documents at  on september  the bids were opened and on september  the corps announced that h construction was the apparent lowest bidder and would be awarded the contract ar tab  co statement at  ar tab  bid evaluation documents on october  gldd filed a protest with our office alleging that h constructions bid was materially unbalanced based on its price for clin  for mobilizationdemobilization in the base year upon review the corps concluded that h constructions bid was materially unbalanced and therefore nonresponsive as its clin  price was significantly higher than all other bidders and the government estimate ar at  after concluding that h constructions bid was nonresponsive the agency canceled the ifb and our office dismissed gldds protest of the award to h construction as academic on november  gldd filed a protest with our office challenging the corps decision to cancel the ifb rather than awarding the contract to gldd as the lowest responsive bidder protest at  on december  the corps submitted its report on the protest gldd filed timely comments on the report on december  on january   while the protest was pending at our office the corps issued a revised ifb for the dredging work as relevant here the january  ifb added a second option year ifb jan   at  more significantly the january  ifb replaced clin  for mobilizationdemobilization in the base year with separate mobilization and demobilization clins for the base year and added clins for demobilization in each of the option years id at  the january  ifb also deleted dfars §  which had provided for the  percent lump sum payments for mobilization and demobilization the revised ifb explained that the contractor would be paid for demobilization through the demobilization clin for the appropriate year eg through the base year clin if no options were exercised or through the clin for the final option exercised id at  gldd subsequently argued that the issuance of the january  ifb demonstrated that the corps lacked a compelling basis to cancel the august  ifb for reasons relating to the evaluation quantities for the dredging work our office requested that the corps and the protester submit additional briefing regarding the january  ifb in this briefing the agency explained the basis for the revisions in the january  ifb discussion gldd argues that the corps improperly canceled the ifb because the agency did not have a compelling reason for its action as required under the far in its response to the protest the corps identified several reasons why it believed that cancellation of the august  ifb was proper as relevant here the agency argues that the august  ifb was ambiguous with regard to the mobilization and demobilization clins and that this defect could result in the government paying twice for demobilization services agency supp response jan   at  agency response to gao interrogatories jan   at  because we conclude that the defects concerning the mobilization and demobilization clins provide a compelling basis to cancel the solicitation we do not address the agencys other bases for cancellation  when an agency issues an ifb and opens bids award must be made to the bidder who submitted the lowest responsive bid unless there if a compelling reason to reject all bids and cancel the invitation federal acquisition regulation § a the standard for canceling an ifb after bids have been opened is different from the standard for canceling a request for proposals rfp after award an agency need only demonstrate a reasonable basis to cancel an rfp after award see noelke gmbh b feb    cpd ¶  at  this different standard applies because of the potential adverse impact on the competitive bidding system of cancelation after bid prices have been exposed at a public bid opening united contracting llc b jan    cpd ¶  at  a compelling reason to cancel a solicitation after bid opening exists where material solicitation terms are ambiguous or in conflict pj dick inc b b mar    cpd ¶  at  the corps argues that the mobilization and demobilization clins in the august  ifb required revision because the solicitation was ambiguous as to how the successful contractor would be paid for these services as discussed above the august  ifb contained clin  for mobilizationdemobilization and clin  for demobilization the august  ifb also incorporated the following dfars clause which specified how mobilization and demobilization costs would be paid a the government will pay all costs for the mobilization and demobilization of all of the contractors plant and equipment at the contract lump sum price for this item  sixtyfive  percent of the lump sum price upon completion of the contractors mobilization at the work site  the remaining thirty five  percent upon completion of demobilization dfars §  ifb at  the august  ifb also provides demobilization will be paid at the completion of the base year if the option year is not exercised if the option year is exercised demobilization will be paid upon its completion ifb at  in contrast the revised january  ifb contained clin  for mobilization and clin  for demobilization in the base year and clins  and  for demobilization in each option year the january  ifb also did not incorporate dfars §  the corps argues that the august  ifb clins created an ambiguity because for similar dredging contracts there is typically one mobilization at the beginning of contract performance and one demobilization at either the end of the base year or at the end of the option year if the option is exercised agency supp response jan   at  the agency argues that under the august  ifb the clin structure for mobilization and demobilization created the possibility that the agency would pay twice for a service provided only once agency response to gao interrogatories jan   at  we agree with the corps that the august  ifb was ambiguous with regard to the price to be paid for mobilization and demobilization specifically inclusion of clin  for both mobilization and demobilization in the base year as well as clin  for demobilization in the option year creates uncertainty as to whether the contractor would be paid once or twice for demobilization in this regard as discussed above dfars §  provides that  percent of the lump sum for mobilization and demobilization will be paid upon completion of mobilization and the remaining  percent of that lump sum amount will be paid upon completion of demobilization as applied to the august  ifb clins it is not clear whether lump sum means only the price for clin  for mobilizationdemobilization in the base year or the sum of the prices for clin  as well as clin  for demobilization in the option year for example if the term lump is read to mean that the contractor will be paid the sum of both clin  and  and the agency does not exercise the option year the agency would pay for demobilization twiceonce for the portion of clin  attributable to demobilization and once for demobilization under clin  as another example if the term lump sum is read to mean only clin  then it is not clear how much the agency should pay for demobilization if it exercises the option year under dfars § a the agency is obligated to pay the remaining  percenthowever it is unclear whether that amount should include only clin  or that clin plus the remainder  percent of clin  gldd contends that the ifb was not ambiguous and would not result in the government paying twice for demobilization services in this regard the protester states that in its performance of prior contracts it was the practice of the agency to pay  percent of the price for the base year mobilizationdemobilization clin upon completion of mobilization to exercise the option year and then pay the full unit price for the demobilization clin in the option year protesters supp comments jan   at  although the protester contends that the agency could potentially avoid any confusion or ambiguity concerning payment for mobilization and demobilization by following this prior practice there is no guarantee that the contract here would be performed in the same manner moreover there is no guarantee that the successful bidder under the ifb here would not dispute the method for calculating the method of payment under the contracts disputes clause given the ambiguities discussed above in sum we conclude that the ifb terms governing the amount to be paid for demobilization are ambiguous and in conflict and therefore provide a compelling reason for cancelling the august  ifb the protest is denied susan a polinggeneral counsel citations to the ifb in this decision refer to the solicitation issued on august   as discussed below the corps issued a revised solicitation on january   additionally although not directly relevant here the corps initially issued the solicitation on may   as a total small business setaside and received two bids contracting officer co statement ¶  after bidopening the unsuccessful bidder h construction corporation filed a protest with the small business administration sba arguing the apparent low bidder ah contractors inc was not a small business id ¶  ar tab c h construction protest letter to sba on august  sba sustained the protest ar tab f sba size determination on august  the agency canceled the initial ifb after determining that there was insufficient competition to make an award per federal acquisition regulation far part  co statement ¶  another difference between the august  ifb and the january  ifb is that the january  ifb added a second option year the corps identified other bases for cancelling the ifb and gldd challenged these bases because we conclude that the defects with the mobilization and demobilization clins provided a compelling basis to cancel the solicitation we do not address the other issues as gldd notes the corps did not cite the mobilization and demobilization clins as a compelling basis for cancelling the solicitation in its initial report on the protest the agency first raised this argument in its response to the protesters january   filing concerning the january  ifb our office has held that even if an agencys initial bases for cancelling an ifb are not compelling cancellation is not objectionable if the agency subsequently identifies a compelling basis for the cancellation mid atlantic commcns b mar    cpd ¶ at  additionally although not specifically argued by the corps it is also unclear how the agency should calculate the price for mobilization dfars § a states that the contractor should be paid a lump sum based on percent of the combined price for mobilization and demobilization if the agency does not know whether it will exercise the option year it is unclear whether the mobilization price should include clins  and  or only clin  find recent legal decisions  » explore related legal resources  » jul   truston technologies inc we deny the protest b aerosage llc we deny in part and dismiss

the department of the army corps of engineers for beachfill and sand dune construction on absecon island new jersey gldd contends that the corps lacked a compelling reason to cancel the ifb we deny the protest background the procurement is part of a decades‑long joint project between the corps and the state of new jersey department of environmental protection njdep for hurricane and storm damage reduction on absecon island an mile long barrier island in atlantic county new jersey comprised of four coastal municipalities atlantic city ventnor city margate city and the borough of longport see absecon island coastal storm risk management available at wwwnapusace armymilmissionscivilworksabseconislandstormdamagereductionaspx the project consists of berm and dune beachfill to be constructed along the oceanfront of the four municipalities id the atlantic city and most of the ventnor city beachfill was completed in june  see id under a new project partnership agreement to complete the remaining beachfill njdep is responsible for acquiring the necessary real estate interests and the corps is responsible for construction costs  agency report ar at  on september   the philadelphia district of the corps issued the ifb seeking a contractor to construct the remaining stretch of beachfill in margate longport and the southern portion of ventnor ifb at  ifb §    summary of work at  the solicitation incorporated federal acquisition regulation far clause  contract awardsealed biddingconstruction which provides for award to the lowestpriced responsible bidder ifb §    the ifb warned bidders that bids would not be opened unless the real estate issues had been resolved and that there was no guarantee that the outstanding issues would be resolved or that a contract would be awarded ifb at  on october  njdep filed administrative orders with the atlantic county clerk’s office “taking” ie seizing perpetual easements and other property interests for specified oceanfront parcels in margate in order to proceed with the project see margate v united states army corps of engineers no cv at  dnj jan   property interests over parcels in longport were separately acquired through that borough’s exercise of the new jersey disaster control act which grants municipal governing bodies the authority to seize property in order to restore or construct protective coastal barriers see contracting officer co statement at  citing njsa app a §§  on october  njdep provided an “authorization for entry for construction” to the corps certifying that njdep had obtained sufficient title and real property interest over the required parcels in order for the corps to begin construction ar tab h njdep authorization for entry for constr at  the authorization was executed by the administrator of njdep as well as the assistant attorney general for njdep who certified that njdep had the legal authority to grant the authorization id two firms including gldd submitted bids in response to the ifb that were opened on october  co statement at  gldd was the apparent low bidder ar tab i bid abstract at  on november  hours before the corps was to award the contract to gldd margate city and two private oceanfront landowners sought in us district court a temporary restraining order tro to enjoin the corps and njdep from awarding any contract for the construction of sand dunes on margate beaches co statement at  see margate supra at  among other things the plaintiffs argued that njdep’s taking of property interests by administrative order failed to comply with the condemnation proceedings required under new jersey’s eminent domain act njsa tit  thereby denying the plaintiffs of their right to challenge the state’s determination that the taking was for a public use margate supra at  co statement at  the federal district court granted the tro on that same date november  and the corps immediately discontinued efforts to award the contract co statement at  on december  following a court hearing on the tro the contracting officer requested that both bidders extend their bids for  days during the pendency of the court proceedings id at  see ar tabs ln requests for bid extension gldd only agreed to extend its bid for  days the second bidder agreed to extend its bid for  days ar tabs no bidder responses to extension requests on january   the federal district court issued an opinion agreeing with margate and the private landowners that njdep’s seizure of property interests by administrative order likely violated the state’s eminent domain act see margate supra at  however the court denied without prejudice the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction because construction of the project was not imminent and njdep represented to the court that njdep would file formal condemnation proceedings for the parcels id at  on february  in an unrelated case the superior court in neighboring ocean county ruled that new jersey’s disaster control act did not authorize the township of long beach to acquire easements for shore protection unless the municipality also complied with the procedures required under the state’s eminent domain act minke family trust v long beach no ocnl at   nj super ct feb   as relevant here and as noted above the borough of longport had exercised this same disaster control act authority to seize the property interests needed to complete the longport portion of the absecon island project on february  the agency cancelled the ifb the contracting officer informed the bidders that he had determined pursuant to far § c that it was in the public interest to cancel the solicitation because the legal challenges to the real estate acquisitions for the project had not been resolved see eg ar tab v ifb cancellation letter to gldd he advised the bidders that award of the contract under the pending litigation would pose a significant risk to the government id this protest followed discussion gldd argues that the corps lacks a compelling reason to cancel the ifb after bid opening and maintains that the agency did not meaningfully consider delaying contract award gldd complains that its competitors will seek to undercut its low bid in any subsequent re‑procurement and urges the corps to reinstate the ifb and permit bidders to extend their bid acceptance periods pending resolution of the real estate issues the corps asserts that its inability to provide the required real estate interests and the indeterminate amount of time that it will take njdep to acquire those interests through the more time consuming eminent domain process provide compelling reasons to cancel the ifb moreover the corps maintains that the project performance period will remain unknown for many monthslikely impacting bid prices and the availability of other offerors to compete for the requirementwhich also provide compelling reasons to cancel the solicitation ar at  citing inter alia southwest marine inc b b jan    cpd ¶  the corps maintains that when it issued the ifb neither the corps nor njdep expected the litigation discussed above which effectively reversed njdep’s earlier authorization for construction a contracting agency must have a compelling reason to cancel an ifb after bid opening due to the potential adverse impact on the competitive bidding system of resoliciting after bid prices have been exposed far § a hdl research lab inc b‑ may   ‑ cpd ¶  at  contracting officials have broad discretion to determine whether a compelling reason to cancel exists and our review is limited to considering the reasonableness of their decision chenega mgmt llc b‑ aug    cpd ¶  at  we find the corps’ decision to cancel the ifb reasonable under the circumstances described above the margate litigation and the indeterminate delays that are likely to result from the required condemnation proceedings provided compelling reasons for the corps to cancel the solicitation the corps’ decision is also consistent with the ifb’s explicit and emphatic warning to potential bidders that there was no guarantee that outstanding real estate issues would be resolved or that a contract would be awarded ifb at  moreover contrary to the protester’s assertion the corps did in fact consider postponing the award date and requested that bidders extend their bids for  days as discussed above despite its arguments now gldd initially refused to extend its bid for  days and agreed only to a day extension which it later extended to  days while the protester apparently believes that the corps should continue to seek an indefinite number of bid extensions we believe that the agency acted reasonably here and was not required to do more to the extent that gldd asserts that the corps did not consider the risks to bidders of cancelling the ifb without award the agency states and the protester does not dispute that the decision to cancel the ifb was taken after substantial consultation with the project manager real estate professionals legal counsel and others who concluded that the litigation may negatively impact the progress of any awarded contract we find no basis to disagree with the agency’s deliberations or ultimate decision to cancel the solicitation the protest is denied susan a poling general counsel  the remaining parcels in ventnor are not directly at issue here  as explained in the court’s opinion margate had long opposed njdep’s storm prevention strategies including its current joint project with the corps to construct  foot high  foot wide sand dunes because margate residents believed the local topography and the city’s system of bulkheads were sufficient to prevent catastrophic storm damage margate v united states army corps of engineers no cv at  dnj jan    on january  gldd extended its bid for an additional  days ar tab p gldd bid extension no  at   the court ordered the corps to give days prior notice in the event that the corps prepared to proceed with construction in order to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to seek reconsideration of the court’s denial of the preliminary injunction margate supra at   the long beach island project is also a joint storm damage reduction project between the corps and njdep see wwwnapusacearmymilmissions civilworkslongbeachislandstormdamagereductionaspx  the corps maintains that the earliest possible date by which njdep could acquire the necessary real estate interests through condemnation under the state’s eminent domain act would be mid to late june  but that there is a high likelihood that the time period would be substantially longer and indeterminate if further litigation arises in that regard ar at  see eg supra n court denying plaintiffs’ motion for
