forgotten to switch out the lockout of the fox until im going downhill my bad the swinger spv does a nice job when climbing so no switch needed one less thing to grab for or think about when riding i

all that supple travel from sapping your power the rebound can be adjusted from none to dead slow and the air pressures are less than the same sag on a fox shock anyone thinking of upgrading a older

with less pedal bob but with the smoothness i need i researched every shock on the market extensively and found that the manitou offered the features i was looking for i was right love the adjustability seems to be almost endless possibilities you can set it up as firm or soft as you like i set it up to be plenty active to supply the smoothness but enough air in the spv to offer the pedaling efficiency i needed set the rebound in the medium and i have a shock that is smooth and efficient love it granted ive only had the shock for a short period of time but will submit another

do it all use i originally put on my gf cake and it provided a more plush ride with the ability to take bigger hits only experience a small amount of pedal bob in second and third chainrings while cranking on the jamis it is super smooth i have been able to tune it to nearly bottom about  of the time leaving the remainder of the riding smooth no pedal bob with minimal pressure in the spv i dont set sag because i blow through travel too quickly and at  lbs the shock has held up really well the cake shock has over  miles on it and jamis shock has  miles on it i have thought about replacing it

the fox float served well over the years but needed the seals changed every    months the swinger is a way and i could not find specific details in the manual so i read a few reviews and tried setting it up the sag adjustment is a real pain on my jekyll i need to remove the rear bolt and swing the shock down once ill dialed it in i took it out for some urban assault im in luxembourg so i headed up through the vineyards and few forest roads through some villages down stairs etc did i say there is no pedal bob i didnt realize how bad my fox was appears to suck up medium to big hits well so well i

was like riding a pogo stick not sure how i did it for so long that said the new pp technology is pretty darn goodi just rode the swingerim using the  waylast night for the first time i ride  days a week and weigh  lbs i try and brake the bike or myself everytime i ride and crank the biggest gears possible i ride a x when im not on the superlight however i may ride the x less because the swinger three has made the single pivot superlight climb like a hard tailonly better since it gives just enough that i dont spin the back wheel when im standing up on the bike otherwise the rear end is immobile until i hit something at which point it moves upwardon descents it railed and was very plush this canged the whole ride of the bike and enabled me to push harder and go faster since i could keep my body weight where i wanted it and not get bucked by the pogoing shocki am running at about  in the main chamber and  in the spv chamber i guess the accepted rule is to ride it at  lbs below your body weight in the main but that is crazy the shock didnt move when i did that and i like a very firm rearend i set the rebound on the slow side of the middle of the range i perhaps havent found the sweet spot that everybody is looking for but its sick and i probably wont fuk with it too much honestly the bike rides way better than any of the blurs or yetis that ive riden with a variety of shocks all of the vpps that ive riden have bounced after being setup by the shop guys if any body has studied physics or rides by feel as much as they think they do then you know that force or motion

simon jeffery a weekend warrior from kuala lumpurdate reviewed may  strengths    when it works it seems okweaknesses    leaking seals and questionable assemblybottom line   i took delivery of a new  frame last december i specified the spv  way because id had a great expereince with a spv  way supplied with a  model trek liquid there were a few options of shocks you could specify with the intense frame on the first day of delivery i went to pump up the shock and all the air immediately leaked out i found out that the little valve holder that you stick your pump onto wasnt screwed in tight well i screwed it up finger tight and the o ring split this was not a big deal as i removed the valve holder wrapped a bit of teflon tape around its thread pumped it up and off i went the local malaysian bike store that supplied the shock got me a replacement o ring they are good guys here  called ksh bicycles no big deal but  over the coming months i noticed it slowly but surely lost air my old spv never lost a single psi so this annoyed me a bit i sent an email to answer products who responded with the same as they responded to the writer below on the th oct   sort of saying nicely it is loosing air because it does this when i stick my pump on duh i suppose at least they responded to my email anyway i didnt want to have to send it all the way back to the states and not be able to ride so my lbs double checked the seals for me and loaned me a spare spv  way they had  told you they were good guys well this helped but still it slowly but surely leaked airfinally i thought id upgade it to another brand as i got sick of pumping it up the lbs has checked intense and worked out a fair price for me the intense guys are good as well i took it off on the weekend dumped the air out of it and bingo it sucked fully in on itself at least i know where all the leaking air was going now  to the wrong side of the pistonso in conclusion im a little unsure on manitou shocks now my first spv  way was extremely reliable this second one leaves me puzzled not so much with the seal issue but also that from day one it had a small assembly problem also the shock has a spv lockoutbypass lever but to this day i can not find a manaul on their website that notes how this lever is to be used perhaps i was just unlucky as im sure they sell thousands of these shock every year when they work they are
