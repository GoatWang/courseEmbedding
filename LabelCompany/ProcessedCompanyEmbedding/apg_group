term ultrasonic means above human hearing or any sound wave above  khz this method is quite accurate and we’ve developed a line of sensors with an accuracy of  of detected range because the speed of sound is a constant under fixed atmospheric conditions the time from the sound burst to the return is measured and translated into a distance the sensor’s microprocessor calculates the distance and converts it to a level indication volume measurement or a rate of flow it also compensates for temperature and filters the signal common uses for ultrasonic level sensors are level volume and flow monitoring other uses include presence or absence detection and object dimensioning ultrasonic level sensors are typically quite small low maintenance and easy to ship and install each of our ultrasonic sensors have a microprocessor which allows for more advanced control in addition they do not come in contact with the target substance which avoids buildup and damage ultrasonic sensors require an unobstructed air column between the sensor and the target anything that deflects or absorbs the signal or acts as a false surface may cause erroneous readings this can result from physical obstructions excessive foam heavy vapors thick dust and light powders a stilling pipe can be used to contain or guide the signal around obstructions or to lessen surface foam a more powerful sensor can also be used to strengthen the signal however our continuous float level transmitters submersible pressure transducers or level switches may be best in these scenarios features programming ultrasonics to fit your application learn more our ultrasonic level sensors are known for their field programmability within minutes you can perfectly match your sensor’s parameters to your application giving you unparalleled performance most of our ultrasonic sensors are designed for use in level applications with ranges from as little as  inches to as much as  feet they are used both indoors and out capable of monitoring in cold and hot weather automatic temperature compensation is standard in each model programming our ultrasonic level sensors is relatively easy and is usually done well in under  minutes this process is fairly straight forward and our tech support is ready to help if you run into trouble there are three main settings you can adjust pulse strength  sensitivity filtering  response time output  trip points pulse strength  sensitivity the pulse strength control lets you fine tune sound wave bursts for optimal detection for your application the sensitivity setting gives you control over how hard the sensor will listen for echoes to put it simply pulse strength is like volume control on a speaker while sensitivity is like volume control on a hearing aid adjusting the two is important you want your pulse strength only as high as is necessary to get a good return signal if you leave it on high all the time it will wear down faster just like a speaker can be blown out by too much volume unlike a speaker the ultrasonic transducer  the part that makes and receives the sound waves  won’t blow out but will wear down over time so if you have your pulse strength ramped up as high as you can just to get a good return signal it means your sensors isn’t powerful enough you need a longer range ultrasonic so you can keep your pulse settings at a happy medium this will give you a better signal and increase the lifespan of your level sensor sensitivity settings are all about receiving the echoes if you have to turn up your sensitivity too much you’ll start to pick up unwanted echoes and erroneous readings having to keep your sensitivity too high is a symptom of either a low pulse strength setting a target that absorbs or dissipates your signal or a sensor with too short a measurement range balancing pulse strength and sensitivity is crucial to a reliable measurement and a durable sensor the good news is you’ll likely be able to use autosense which automatically adjusts pulse strength and sensitivity to optimum settings filtering  response time filtering out unwanted echoes with your ultrasonic level sensor is easy with a few different settings you can control the maximum and minimum detection distances the averaging of your readings and the response speed to changing levels setting a maximum and minimum detection distance simply causes the sensor to ignore any echoes outside of that range the minimum detection distance is really controlled by lengthening your blanking distance which is a short distance right in front of the sensor face where nothing can be detected see individual sensor specifications the maximum distance setting is helpful if you ignore static or mobile objects in the distance averaging your readings is a way to smooth out your level changes you’ll need this feature unless you have a very slow moving perfectly still surface to detect any amount of turbulence or uneven movement on the surface and averaging becomes very valuable simply tell the sensor how many samples singular readings you want to average the more samples you choose the greater the smoothing effect controlling the response speed to changing levels is very helpful for filtering out a lot of noise this setting is called a window or a set distance of your choosing in front of and behind the current distance reading this is a moving window that follows the current accepted reading along with the window you’ll set the number of samples the sensor needs to detect out of the window before it validates as a new level essentially you’re causing your sensor to double check the changes in the level before it serves it to you as an output both averaging and the windows settings can speed up and slow down response time if you have a fast moving target then you’ll want to be careful here lower averaging and a looser window is required to keep your readings caught up with rapid changes output  trip points setting up your output on our ultrasonic level sensors is a simple process of defining your maximum and minimum output values but it doesn’t stop there our most popular series have the option to include  built in npn trip points trip points help you control pumps alarms and valves easily other manufacturers don’t include trip points in their ultrasonic level sensors forcing you to spend another couple hundred dollars on a module we not only offer them built into the sensor but we offer them at no additional cost feature rich vs feature starved some of our competitors want you to believe that their lower cost ultrasonic level sensors are just as good as our higher quality line the fact is they don’t allow the programming of your sensor like we do this means that you’ll never know if their ultrasonic sensor will work for you if it does you lucked out if it doesn’t there’s nothing you can do about it having the programming options on one of our ultrasonic level sensor ensures you can get the performance you expect applications from time to time we get some customers who try some very interesting things with ultrasonic sensors  even if we express some skepticism they’ve been used on everything from race cars to apple harvesters some more successfully than others but most of our ultrasonic level sensors are either used for liquid level open channel flow or for presence detection and object profiling where they perform very well liquid level the most popular application for ultrasonic level sensors is measuring level in a body of liquid be it in a tank well pit or lake if the container is linear then inferring a volume measurement is easy in nonlinear containers a strapping chart is often used to adjust the reading to a volume as level rises and falls our ultrasonic level sensors are quite accurate  of detected range and suitable for most measurements outside of custody transfer applications most of our ultrasonics are designed specifically for level measurement refer to the specifications to make sure you find a sensor that will work well for you solid level another very popular application for ultrasonic sensors is solid level detection this differs dramatically from liquid level detection because solids don’t provide a flat hard target the target is often uneven and soft however ultrasonic sensors still do a good job much of the time the trick is really to use a sensor with double the needed range this gives you a much stronger signal that will provide a better echo for your sensor to measure you may also need to angle the mount of the sensor to be perpendicular to the angle of repose level measurement with solids has always been difficult and while technologies new and old promise optimum performance ultrasonics will remain a staple for continuous noncontact measurement avoid using ultrasonic level sensors on light powders or especially dusty environments the softness of light powders will absorb most of the sound signal while dust will dissipate the signal in the air before it can return to the sensor you may still opt to use an ultrasonic in a dusty environment if you’re willing to wait for a good level reading once the dust settles open channel flow another great fit for our ultrasonic sensors is open channel flow open channels are a primary means of transporting filtering and metering water open channel flow monitoring is used in water treatment plants in environmental monitoring and in irrigation canals our ultrasonic level sensors are commonly paired with an appropriate controller for flow calculations over open channels they are preferred for their ruggedness in outdoor environments where reliability is paramount several of our models are a good fit for this application presence detection  object profiling there are many technologies designed for detecting objects and controlling the movements of machines and robotics ultrasonic sensors are well suited for some of them for example did you know the automatic car wash industry relies heavily on ultrasonic sensors for detecting vehicles and controlling the movement of brushes ultrasonic level sensors are good in many of these applications because of their ability to handle adverse conditions object detection required in dirty or wet environments where the targets are fairly slow moving is potentially a good fit for ultrasonic sensors our iru series is designed for these applications testimonials the product performs really well we have used other ultrasonic sensors and your products seem to perform better and

temperature stays within the operating temperature range specified by your specific model you also need to be aware of the effects of temperature on the speed of sound and how your sensor will attempt to compensate each of our ultrasonic sensors is equipped with automatic temperature compensation that keeps your sensor readings accurate as temperature changes the features works very well unless the temperature around your sensor is remarkably different than the temperature at the target surface when the temperature at the sensor is different than the surface temperature of your target you have a temperature gradient that changes the speed of sound as it travels this scenario should be avoided completely to ensure an accurate measurement when using an ultrasonic sensor outside protect it from heating up in the sun by keeping it in the shade and away from metal housings or covers if you are having troubles with temperature gradients you can turn off automatic temperature compensation and use periodic adjustments to the programming to improve accuracy to an acceptable level back to top will my parameters be saved after a blackout yes our ultrasonic sensors are equipped with a nonvolatile memory no data is lost when the unit is shut down even during a power outage back to top can i adjust the sound beam angle yes you can change the effective beam angle a little by adjusting the pulse and sensitivity parameters in your ultrasonic sensor programming software as you strengthen both the sound wave and the sensitivity to return signals you increase the sensors ability to pick up readings from a wider angle as you weaken both the sound wave and the sensitivity you reduce your sensors ability to pick up return signals from wide angles youre not actually changing the sound

known as pressure transducers use piezoresistive technology to accurately measure pressure this is based off of a small circuit called a wheatstone bridge attached to the back of a diaphragm as the diaphragm flexes from pressure the resistance in the wheatstone bridge hereafter known as the “sensing element” changes relative to pressure providing a basis of measurement there are a few different methods of mounting the sensing element to the pressure transmitter diaphragm each has it’s own set of pros and cons for example some perform better in low pressure environments others in high pressure we’ll use the best method according to the configuration of your sensor once the measurement is taken the transmitter conditions the signal to the output you have chosen and sends it off to your control system features while we only list a few pressure transducer families each has a wide variety of configurable options when you purchase these include options for outputs pressure ranges electrical connections and pin outs and process fittings most allow you to adjust the zero and span in the field as well applications apg pressure transmitters are used throughout industry in both process and storage environments our ptl families are built for industrial applications in pressure ranges up to  psi and are suitable for both liquids and gasses they are designed to provide accurate measurements and a long life expectancy at a low cost our pt family is designed for extreme environments in particular our heavy duty pressure transducers are designed to handle dirt  fine dust water
