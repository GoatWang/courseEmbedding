investment management and financial planning are both critical parts of the service we offer and our standard fee covers both how can i have reasonable assurance that i will not outlive my money it is important to employ an investment strategy that offers the opportunity for reasonable investment returns while reducing the possibility of disastrous investment results the appropriate balance of risk and expected return differs according to each client’s specific circumstances it is also critical to set sustainable spending targets and to regularly revisit the assumptions and unfolding realities that underlie those targets that is why we create a lifetime spending plan for each client and keep it up to date what is the best way to maximize my investment income particularly in these times of very low interest rates few people have the ability to generate the investment income that they need from dividends and interest alone because the goal of generating adequate income must be balanced with the goals of offsetting future inflation earning a high investment return and protecting the portfolio value from both rising interest rates falling bond prices and falling interest rates falling income we take a “total return” approach to income generation using a very broad range of investment asset classes we arrange for regular income distributions replenishing the portfolio cash from dividend income interest income and realized capital appreciationhow do i get started with your servicesthe first step is to talk with one of our investment professionals to determine whether we are a good fit for one another once we agree that we can work effectively as a team we will guide you through the steps to getting your financial matters in order and working toward meeting your life goals
