“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks uncertainties and requirements that are difficult to predict or are beyond our control forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this quarterly report you should not put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements we

investments in israeli startup companies through equitybased crowdfunding   results of operation   nine and three months ended september   compared to nine and three months ended september     selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses amounted to  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively and to  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively the increase in selling general and administrative expenses stems from two nonrecurring payments for services      table of contents   liquidity and capital resources   the following is a summary of the companys cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended september   and the nine months ended september         nine months ended september       nine months ended september     net loss           net cash used in operating activities           net cash provided by financing activities               since inception most of our resources and work have been devoted to planning our business and web site development we need additional funding to continue the implementation of our business plan if we are unable to raise any funds the development costs would have to be provided by our president and chief executive officer to the extent that he is capable and willing to provide such funds   private capital if sought we believe will be sought from former business associates of our president and chief executive officer or through private investors referred to us by those same business associates to date we have sold  shares of our common stock for  through a private placement   if a market for our shares ever develops of which there can be no assurances we may use restricted shares of our common stock to compensate employeesconsultants and independent contractors wherever possible we cannot predict the likelihood or source of raising capital or funds that may be needed to complete the development of our business plan   as a public company we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements if required we estimate that these costs will range up to  per year over the next few years and may be significantly higher if our business volume and transactional activity increases but should be lower during our first year of being public because our overall business volume and financial transactions will be lower and we will not yet be subject to the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  for an opinion on our system on internal controls by our independent audit firm until we exceed  million in market capitalization if ever these obligations may reduce our ability and resources to expand our business plan and activities we hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use noncash means of settling outstanding obligations ie issuance of restricted shares of our common stock and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of these efforts   we hope to eventually be able to use our status as a public company to enable us to use noncash means of settling obligations and compensate persons andor firms providing services to us although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts however these actions if successful will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders may further dilute common stock book value and that dilution may be material such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of the company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management      table of contents   as of september   we owed  of which  are in connection with professional services

september   include a going concern note disclosing that our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent on us being able to raise working capital to grow our operations and generate revenue   critical accounting policies   the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances however actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions we have identified in note   summary of accounting policies to the financial statements contained in this quarterly report certain critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have not entered into any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors   contractual obligations   as a smaller

disclosure controls and procedures   we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures the term disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the securities and exchange act of  as amended exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures also include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of september   that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective at a reasonable assurance level and are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures will meet their objectives due to the material weaknesses described below however it should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions regardless of how remote   managements report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance

to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate      table of contents   management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of september   in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls   based on this assessment management has concluded that as of september   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles due to the existence of the following material weaknesses   · lack of segregation of duties     · lack of audit committee and independent directors     · management is dominated by a single individual without adequate compensating controls providing for multiple levels of supervision and review   although we are unable to meet the standards under coso because of the limited resources available to a company of our size we are committed to improving our financial organization as funds become available we will undertake to  create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives  increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function  appoint one or more independent directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to a company audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures and  prepare and implement sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application

     tables of contents since inception most of our resources and work have been devoted to planning our business and web site development we need additional funding to continue the implementation of our business plan if we are unable to raise any funds the development costs would have to be provided by our president and chief executive officer to the extent that he is capable and willing to provide such funds private capital if sought we believe will be sought from former business associates of our president and chief executive officer or through private investors referred to us by those same business associates to date we have sold  shares of our common stock for  through a private placement if a market for our shares ever develops of which there can be no assurances we may use restricted shares of our common stock to compensate employeesconsultants and independent contractors wherever possible we cannot predict the likelihood or source of raising capital or funds that may be needed to complete the development of our business plan as a public company we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements if required we estimate that these costs will range up to  per year over the next few years and may be significantly higher if our business volume and transactional activity increases but should be lower during our first year of being public because our overall business volume and financial transactions will be lower and we will not yet be subject to the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  for an opinion on our system on internal controls by our independent audit firm until we exceed  million in market capitalization if ever these obligations may reduce our ability and resources to expand our business plan and activities we hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use noncash means of settling outstanding obligations ie issuance of restricted shares of our common stock and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of these efforts we hope to eventually be able to use our status as a public company to enable us to use noncash means of settling obligations and compensate persons andor firms providing services to us although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts however these actions if successful will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders may further dilute common stock book value and that dilution may be material such issuances may also serve to enhance existing managements
