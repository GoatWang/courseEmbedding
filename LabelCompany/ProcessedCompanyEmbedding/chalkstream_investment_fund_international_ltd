with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome

ideas editorial team december   back to topby capital ideas editorial team december   the events of the past year have made one thing clear — it’s almost impossible to know what’s coming next but whether it’s economic uncertainty or a geopolitical event that rocks the markets there are steps an investor can take to be prepared for shocks and surprises here are five ways to stay on track despite unforeseen turbulencethis article was updated on march   uncertainty is a sure thing keep calm and carry onwhen it comes to shock and awe  delivered the united kingdom’s decision to leave the european union the election of donald trump as president of the united states turmoil in china’s markets challenges to globalization — clearly the world remains an uncertain placeswift and dramatic change can inspire powerful emotions and lead to very human but ultimately destructive investment decisions for investors confronted with confusion and uncertainty the natural temptation is to retreat “keep calm and carry on” may be good advice but for many investors it can be hard to followhistory offers hope time after time the market has demonstrated its ability to climb a “wall of worry” ever since the market’s low in  in the wake of the financial crisis the sp has demonstrated its strength in the face of issues ranging from the “flash crash” to political turmoil at home and abroadmany of the events depicted on this chart have been costly the market however has not only survived but thrived for more than a century the us market has endured wars recessions assassinations scandals and natural disasters and each time it has come backthrough it all the market has demonstrated remarkable strength and resiliency in the face of challenges investors should follow suitwhat does the rest of the year hold for investorslearn what capital group economists and portfolio managers think in our  midyear outlookget the outlook diversification still matters so keep your balancein the  bear market diversification didn’t matter the great recession took a toll on nearly every asset class and portfolio but in the  downturn diversification worked if you hadn’t piled into tech you were spared a lot of pain when the dotcom bubble burstthe debate over investment diversification is likely to go on and on but today a strategic allocation in stocks and bonds around the world remains a hallmark of a portfolio that can help investors fulfill their objectives in the long runinvestors are likely to be faced with situations in  that might tempt them to deviate from their longterm strategy for example the united states’ economy looks likely to continue setting the pace for global growth while europe’s economy continues to struggle that might make some investors question the value of investing abroadbut today’s environment requires a global perspective investors should consider having exposure to stock and bonds from around the world ideally the resulting portfolio will have the potential to benefit from the extraordinary changes in the world’s capital markets that present longterm investment opportunitieswhile it is true that rising interest rates can hurt bond prices in the near term bonds should continue to play an important role in a diversified portfolio bonds can mitigate volatility preserve capital and supply the investor with either current income or a relatively certain amount at some point in the futureit’s also important to remember that over the long term higher rates can be beneficial for fixed income investors as bonds are sold or reach maturity the proceeds can be reinvested in bonds with a higher coupon which can help offset the impact of price declines“if you’re a longterm investor you have to remember that you are constantly reinvesting bond coupons bond maturities” says capital group portfolio manager wesley phoa “if rates are trending higher you’re reinvesting them at higher rates and so the returns that you end up getting don’t look as bad as you might have expected” income is scarce casting a wide net can pay dividendsthere are nearly  million people over  in the united states and many of them have one thing in common they want their dividends millions of retiring baby boomers need income but they may have to search far and wide for yieldhistorically dividends have always played a significant role in driving equity returns and helping investors meet their financial goals dividend income is especially important during retirement this chart shows that at a time when an increasing number of people are approaching retirement age the dividend yield of the sp  and the yield on treasuries are both at relatively low levelsto be sure strong demand for dividend income has driven valuations for many traditional dividend payers in the us — such as utilities and consumer staples — high above longterm averagesfor investors willing to look beyond us borders there are a significant number of companies in both developed and emerging international markets with high dividend yields some greater than  in fact since  dividends have accounted for more than half of average annual total returns in developed international marketsglobal bonds can also play a role in portfolios an extraordinary expansion in global capital flows has dramatically increased the selection of fixed income opportunities a global bond strategy can allow investors to participate in these expanding opportunitiesthe evolution of dividendpaying securities abroad just as millions of investors are shifting from accumulating wealth to entering the retirement income phase provides another reason for including international equities and bonds in a welldiversified portfolio relax it’s not all doom and gloomtake a deep breath relax in an age when doom and gloom seem to be all we read about or see on television it just might be possible that things aren’t as bad as they seem in fact things may just be getting better — and not for the few but for the manyin the united states for example disposable personal income reached nearly  trillion in  or nearly  more than in  household credit card debt dropped to  billion in  down from  billion in this chart shows the remarkable decline in poverty around the world indeed the global standard of living is rising at a remarkable rate with millions of people moving into the middle class many of them are reaching for a better life a powerful force that could have significant ramifications for the global economy and companies around the worldthanks to innovation education and a strong entrepreneurial spirit in most of the world the future actually looks bright from cars that can drive themselves to breakthrough drugs that could lead to victory in the war against cancer we may be on the cusp of a dramatically different and better futureduring a time when pessimism can sometimes seem overwhelming capital group portfolio manager carl kawaja has a refreshing theory about life and the world things get better“i think that the world broadly gets better” carl says “i think people become wealthier i think health care becomes better i think education improves i think we know a lot more about the world” life happens control what you can with a longrange plandon’t get too high or too low try to maintain an even keel fight fear with factsall of those can be hard to do when the world’s markets and global economy are going through times that can be both exhilarating and frightening the evidence shows that euphoric investors tend to buy high and fearful investors sell lowthe capital group home of american funds conducted a proprietary survey of investors in  and found that those who work with a financial advisor are more likely to stay on track toward their longterm goals while also feeling better and more confident about achieving them they are also more likely to invest a larger percentage of their income and invest regularlyadvisors can help investors overcome uncertainty and fear by keeping them committed to a consistent investing plan that has the potential to fulfill their investment objectives an advisor can help investors stay focused on the big picture when the market drops for example an advisor can put things in perspective and keep people from jumping out of investments that are aligned with their goals navigating toward your desired

with oil trading at historic lows of under  a barrel safeguarding your portfolio via diversification is especially critical right now – if you do it right investment guru benjamin graham once said of investing “if you are shopping for common stocks choose them the way you would buy groceries not the way you would buy perfume” what graham refers to is diversification – ie spreading your assets around various investments to reduce risk and strengthen performance diversification simply means dividing your investments up into more than one uniform category it’s one of the best ways to help protect your money from the pendulum swings of the economy and the financial markets by diversifying your investments you’re reducing the risk that one investment that’s gone sour will poison the rest of your portfolio the theory is that the classes move in a manner that penalizes those investors who place all their investments in one basket as the old wall street saw goes in fact a sophisticated risk tolerance breakdown will go beyond asset classes stocksbondscash and into what type of stocks largecap growthinternational to boost and protect your portfolio additionally diversification can help boost performance studies show that a properly balanced investment portfolio with holdings in different sectors outperform portfolios than invest in single specific sectors   a closer look at diversification to illustrate how powerful the principle of diversification is consider the following hypothetical scenarios of a diversified mix of investments with various rates of return this is not a representation of actual performance a a  investment with a guaranteed fixed annual rate of return of  will grow to  after  years b the same  could be evenly diversified between five separate investments each with a different degree of risk the net result would be an accumulation value of  after  years or  more than the guaranteed investment although three of the five investments performed below the guaranteed investment the diversification into other assets that outperformed the guaranteed investment provided a greater long term total return   this chart is a hypothetical example for illustrative purposes only it does not reflect a specific investment an actual account value or the performance of any investment the chart represents a single guaranteed investment of  invested at  for  years would grow to  versus diversified investments of  each in five separate investments each with varying degrees of risk and rates of returns which could accumulate to a value of  after  years the diversified investments are an example of  that had loss of  invested at a rate of  would have a rate of return of  invested at  would have a return of  invested at  would have a rate of return of  and invested at a  would have a rate of return of    to get the most out of your diversification strategy consider these tips balance growth and income – a properly balanced investment portfolio has a good mix of investments that emphasize growth like many small capitalization high technology companies with income such as large capitalization companies in traditionally stable sectors like consumer goods and utilities search for dividends  when you’re choosing your blend of growth and income investments opt for companies and funds that offer solid dividend potential dividends offer steady reliable income that can beef up your portfolio’s income in weak financial markets protect your investments with bonds – stocks are mostly about capital appreciation meaning they help your portfolio grow more highly and quickly but bring greater risk to the table bonds which are more about capital preservation help you stabilize your portfolio by reducing risk thus it’s a good idea to add a sturdy fixedincome blend to your investments with treasuries municipal bonds corporate bonds andor bond funds that comprise all three bond investments   go abroad – studies show that investment portfolios with a good dose of foreign stocks and funds offer greater asset protection and can help boost returns too in general if us stocks are underperforming foreign stocks in select international bourses can offer protection with historically solid investment performance as always check with your financial advisor for the best mix of foreign and domestic stocks and funds   consider your age – the number of candles on your birthday cake can also impact investment portfolio balance ideally you’ll want your portfolio’s investment mix to match those candles on your cake and help you fund the right risk tolerance levels for your longterm investment goals the investing age tool can help you determine whether your investing style is aggressive conservative or right in line with other investors your age diversification lowering risk and “smoothing out” returns perhaps the biggest takeaway on diversification is this dividing your investments between the asset classes is proven to lower your investment risk and increase your return “if you are shopping for common stocks choose them the way you would buy groceries not the way you would buy perfume” put another way diversification helps to smooth your returns out over time so that while you may invest in certain volatile assets you have others that will be more balanced in their returns this means you may have lower than average market returns in good years but you won’t lose as much in underperforming years that both stabilizes and supports better investment returns thus helping you stay on track to meet your unique longterm financial goals – all by following graham’s advice and “picking the right groceries” using diversification as your investment model   fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk in that their value will decline as interest rates rise investing in foreign securities presents certain unique risks not associated with domestic investments such as currency fluctuation and political and economic changes diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets and it is possible to lose money when investing in securities
