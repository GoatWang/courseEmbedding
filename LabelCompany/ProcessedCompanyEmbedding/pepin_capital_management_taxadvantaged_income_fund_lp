seeking alpha  followers on seeking alpha investment strategy our goal at capital income management cim is to give clients superior total return performance while protecting capital what separates us from other investment advisors is a unique investment strategy that utilizes the inefficiencies that exist between diversified securities commonly known as exchange traded funds etfs and closedend funds cefs etfs and cefs are used by investors to achieve diversified equity exposure in the markets but not many investment managers analyze the relationship between these funds and develop portfolios based around their relative valuations we have found that active portfolio management of these two mostly passive investment fund classes is all one needs to realize a high income and growth portfolio with manageable risk diversified securities history has shown that investing in nondiversified securities such as individual stocks can be a minefield during down or bear market cycles and can make portfolio recovery extremely difficult even when markets recover we only invest in exchange traded funds etfs and closedend funds cefs which minimizes any sudden drop in security holdings due to their diversity etfs and cefs give investors the relative safety they need while offering the tradability of individual securities high income securities our goal is to offer clients total annual portfolio income yields of at least  so that even if the market goes through a rough patch our portfolios are still yielding income cefs and etfs give us the means to achieve such high income yields through various income strategies growth opportunities etfs can really only match their benchmark indices but because cefs can often trade with more volatility than etfs but yet still retain the safety of diversification cefs tend to offer better growth opportunities discount market prices cefs often trade at premium and discount market prices to their navs and will often present opportunities for more sophisticated investors our strategy monitors over  cefs for dislocations when premium and discount market prices result in under or overvaluation levels hedging strategies the success of our strategy during difficult market periods was due in large part to hedging benchmark etfs or premium priced cefs securities that provided downside protection when our portfolios were fully invested or when markets looked vulnerable to a correction understanding etfs understanding cefs understanding exchange traded funds exchange traded funds etfs have become the fastest growing segment of securities in the markets over the past decade both in their numbers and their assets but what are etfs and why have they become so popular much of the reason lies in the same reason why mutual funds became so popular diversification in one investment the advantages of diversification have long been highlighted but they become even more pronounced during market downturns and enhanced market volatility like mutual funds etfs represent a portfolio of securities that adhere to a particular investment strategy index or industry sector unlike mutual funds etfs generally do not have actively managed portfolios have significantly lower expense ratios than most actively managed mutual funds and can be traded during open market hours like a stock without the unmitigated downside risk that nondiversified securities retain at capital income management cim we utilize etfs in conjunction with cefs because cefs will often correlate with similar indexes that etfs follow but at a discount or premium price analyzing these two securities together can give investors an advantage based on these relative valuation differences cim will use etfs in long positions in our client portfolios as well as hedged positions with cefs hedged positions are most important during difficult market periods to give portfolios downside protection etfs have quickly become one of the primary investments of choice for many institutional asset managers because of their size and liquidity many etfs include some of the most heavily traded securities on the nyse and other global stock exchanges and include some of the biggest financial names as well understanding closedend funds closedend funds cefs are one of the most misunderstood and underutilized security classes in the markets today there are hundreds of equity and bond cefs trading on the open market exchanges representing over  billion in assets but yet most investors know nothing about them like etfs cefs can trade like a stock during open market hours and have diversified portfolios of us based and international stocks andor bonds unlike etfs however cefs can trade at market prices which are significantly higher or lower than their net worth commonly referred to as the net asset value nav the nav is the funds total net worth and includes all the funds assets minus all its liabilities for etfs and mutual funds investors buy or sell shares at the market price which is designed to trade at the nav price this is because mutual funds and etfs are known as openend funds and can continuously offer new shares to willing buyers and sellers thus funds can match the market price with the nav for closedend funds however the number of shares is set when the security goes public and is closed to issuing new shares as a result the market price for those finite number of shares is determined by investor demand and that demand can result in market prices substantially different from the funds nav price funds which trade at market prices higher than the nav are said to be at a premium whereas funds which trade lower are said to be at a discount this premium and discount feature is unique to cefs and adds a valuation metric that other security classes do not have for example investors who purchase a closedend fund at say a  discount in essence purchase all of the funds holdings at a similar  discount but just because a cef may have holdings which perform one way does not mean that the funds market price has to follow suit whereas a cefs nav is only based on the value and performance of its holdings a cefs market price can be based more on investor emotions and market sentiment and as is often the case investor emotions can be subjective and sentiment can drive cef market prices to under and overvaluation levels for more sophisticated investors who perform due dilligence and analysis on cefs the discount and premium valuation metric can often present opportunities at capital income management we continuously analyze cefs for dislocations in their premiums and discounts looking for opportunities another significant feature of cefs that separates them from most other investments is that cefs generally offer exceptionally high dividend yields this is because cefs often use enhanced income techniques that most mutual funds or etfs do not enhanced income can come from several strategies that the funds use to generate income that the fund then passes on to investors in the form of high distributions and yields though yields are a function of current market prices it is not unusual to see cefs offering  to  or more annualized yields paid monthly or quarterly part of capital income managements analysis of cefs includes the effectiveness of a funds income strategy in current market conditions certain strategies are more effective in up markets and some are more effective in flat or down markets and we manage our portfolios to take advantage of this income efficiency dependent on our market outlook because of their comparative high yields cefs tend to appeal to high net worth investors looking for higher income from their investments but one should not think of cefs as boutique investments only appropriate for wealthy investors cefs represent a broad mix of equity and bond market sectors and indices and cef sponsors come from some of the largest and most progressive financial companies in the world note etfs and cefs are not guaranteed and investors can lose any and all of their investment etf  cef fund sponsors contact for more information on

summary overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to

residents strategy under normal market conditions it is the funds fundamental policy to invest at least  of its total assets which includes the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in california municipal bonds but as a general rule the percentage is much higher the funds duration typically ranges from four to twelve years it is nondiversified risk the municipal market can be affected by adverse tax legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities municipal funds carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities they also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible although statespecific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from federal alternative minimum tax outcomes cannot be guaranteed and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes residency in the state is usually required for the state income tax exemption generally municipal securities are not appropriate for taxadvantaged accounts such as iras and ks additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials if available additional disclosures this description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund read the funds prospectus for more detailed information about the fund duration is a measure of a securitys price sensitivity to changes in interest rates duration differs from maturity in that it considers a securitys interest payments in addition to the amount of time until the security reaches maturity and also takes into account certain maturity shortening features eg demand features interest rate resets and call options when applicable securities with longer durations generally tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with shorter durations a fund with a longer average duration generally can be expected to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than a fund with

avg high below average this fund scores below average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment

invest before considering an investment in the fund you should understand that you could lose money the value of the funds investments may fluctuate because of changes in the markets in which the fund invests which could cause the fund to underperform other funds with similar objectives changes in these markets may be rapid and unpredictable the energy markets have experienced and may continue to experience volatility in recent periods including a historic drop in the price of crude oil and national gas prices such conditions may negatively impact the fund and its shareholders energy companies are subject to certain risks including but not limited to the following fluctuations in the prices of commodities the highly cyclical nature of the natural resources sector may adversely affect the earnings or operating cash flows of the issuers in which the fund will invest a significant decrease in the production of energy commodities would reduce the revenue operating income operating cash flows of mlps and other natural resources sector companies and therefore their ability to make distributions or pay dividends and a sustained decline in demand for energy commodities could adversely affect the revenues and cash flows of energy companies holders of mlp units are subject to certain risks inherent in the structure of mlps including tax risks the limited ability to elect or remove management or the general partner or managing member limited voting rights and conflicts of interest between the general partner or managing member and its affiliates on the one hand and the limited partners or members on the other hand an investment in the fund will involve tax risks including but not limited to the portion if any of a distribution received by the fund as the holder of an mlp equity security that is offset by the mlp’s tax deductions or losses generally will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the fund’s tax basis in the mlp equity security which will cause income or gain to be higher or losses to be lower upon the sale of the mlp security by the fund the fund expects to be treated as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code because of the fund’s previous concentration in mlp investments however the fund was not previously eligible to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company accordingly the fund was taxed as a regular corporation or a “c” corporation for us federal income tax purposes and subject to state and local taxes as a regular corporation changes in tax laws regulations or interpretations of those laws or regulations in the future could adversely affect the fund or the energy companies in which the fund will invest small and midcap stocks are often more volatile and less liquid than largecap stocks smaller companies generally face higher risks due to their limited product lines markets and financial resources funds that invest in bonds are subject to interestrate risk and can lose principal value when interest rates rise bonds are also subject to credit risk in which the bond issuer may fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner high yield securities have speculative characteristics and present a greater risk of loss than higher quality debt securities these securities can also be subject to greater price volatility the fund is nondiversified by concentrating in a
