this offering for the first twelve  months after successful completion of the offering none of the expenditures itemized are listed in any particular order of priority or importance since the company does not intend to pay any offering expenses from the proceeds from this offering and assuming that       or   of the offering is sold the gross aggregate proceeds will be allocated as follows expenditure item     professional fees         dtceligibility fees     automobile inventory     automobile parts and repairs     insurance licenses and registration     website design and development     advertising and marketing     office and miscellaneous expenses     working capital     total         there is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this offering and any funds received will be immediately available to us the above expenditures are defined as follows professional fees pertains to legal services and accounting fees that will be incurred by the company for maintaining fully reporting status with the sec dtceligibility fees pertains to the cost to apply for our shares to be eligible for trading with the depository trust corporation dtc automobile inventory pertains to the cost or purchasing used automobiles for resale we anticipate locating automobiles in the    range automobile parts  repairs pertains to the cost of parts and repairs that are may be required for some of our used automobiles to get them in resale condition insurance licenses and registration pertains to the cost to maintain business licenses insurance on automobiles temporary vehicle demonstration licensing and title transfer  registration costs website design and development pertains to the payments that will be made to design and develop our websites this will be to develop both our corporate website wwwcheetahenterprisescom and our costa rican marketing website wwwcheetahautoscom advertising and marketing pertains to the cost of advertising and marketing our products in the costa rican market office and miscellaneous expenses these are the costs of operating our office including telephone services mail stationery accounting office supplies bank service fees and charges and other miscellaneous expenses associated with running our office working capital pertains to the funds allocated to general working capital funds will be used to cover short falls in other areas if applicable during the next  months there is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire  with this offering therefore the following details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only   or  of this offering if only   of this offering is sold we estimate that this would still provide sufficient capital to purchase  of used automobiles approximately  vehicles significantly develop both our corporate and vehicle sales websites and spend  on advertising and marketing we would not have any funds available in working capital to cover unexpected costs which would necessitate reducing expenses in other areas most likely in website and marketing costs reducing our website and marketing costs would affect our ability to turn over our inventory quickly and could materially affect our ability to generate sales growth in the first year if only   of this offering is sold we estimate that this would provide sufficient capital to purchase  of used automobiles approximately  automobiles only develop a very basic corporate website at wwwcheetahenterprisescom without any development on our wwwcheetahautosalescom website for advertising vehicles and our costa rican based business we would only be able to spend  on advertising and marketing our services and only  for office and miscellaneous expenses under this scenario we estimate that we would be able to generate enough revenues to sustain our business for the next months we would not have any extra funds to allocate for other financial short falls and should we be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business we will have to find other sources of financing if   of this offering is sold we would still incur expected professional legal and accounting fees of  which will have to be paid to maintain reporting status during the next  months we will also pay minimal office and miscellaneous expenses and  will be available for the purchase of one used automobile and related repair and licensing costs based on raising only  or  we will allocate only  to development of our website and only  to advertising and marketing this would seriously hinder the development of our business and our ability to generate sufficient revenues we would not be able to develop the business andor generate sufficient revenues in the first year without additional financing further we would not be able to pay for making our securities dtceligible and thus it is unlikely an investor in this offering would be able to trade his or her shares in a public market should a public market even be achieved if we do not raise sufficient funds to pay professional fees estimated to be  for the first  months we would not be able to remain reporting with the sec and therefore we would not be able to obtain an otcqb quotation we feel we need to raise a minimum of  in offering proceeds in order to implement our business plan and support our operations for the next  months the automotive industry is competitive and has low barriers to entry we compete locally and will eventually compete on a country wide basis with a variety of primarily local companies that offer similar services as ours some of these companies have had many more years of business experience or have greater financial and personnel resources including marketing and sales organizations than we do and may be able to better source product and customers we do not believe any one company holds a dominant share of the local or countrywide market on which we are focused company description cheetah enterprises inc was incorporated in the state
