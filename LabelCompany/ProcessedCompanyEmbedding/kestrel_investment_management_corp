management and individualized client service kestrel investment management corporation is a registered investment adviser located in the san francisco bay area when abbott keller and david steirman founded kestrel in  they did so with a commitment to limiting the amount of capital they would manage recognizing that higher levels of aum can often drag on performance results this continues as a central tenet at kestrel and it enables us to focus on what is most important portfolio management and attentive client service rather than engaging in the time and resourceintensive endeavor of gathering more assets our priority is attending to the individual needs of each client this allows our investment team to focus  on analyzing companies and constructing client portfolios using our internallyderived research single investment approach our strategy is the result of many years of refining and improving upon our original theory that inefficiencies exist in the area of smallcap equities where managements undertake voluntary restructuring programs buybacks spinoffs and asset sales abbott developed this investment strategy over thirty years ago based on the belief that these stocks are more likely to produce superior appreciation small firm culture with big firm infrastructure since executing our first trade for our first client in  our world has changed quite dramatically technology has evolved as has the regulatory landscape within which we operate shifting the way we communicate and partner with our clients what has not changed over that time period however is our commitment to client service we believe in embracing these changes and have found that superior client service requires a welldesigned operations infrastructure we continue to invest in high quality systems that enable us to meet the demands of our most discerning institutional clients our stateoftheart trading portfolio accounting and trade confirmation tools are robust yet flexible and are a reflection of our commitment to delivering the information our clients require at the time they need it and in the format that best suits them   about usstrategyteam our strategy is based on our belief that the stocks of smallcap companies undergoing voluntary restructuring are more likely to produce superior price appreciation abbott established this strategy over  years ago and we have continued to refine it over time   kestrel investment management  home unique strategy history of results kestrel investment management is a smallcap equity manager with a unique valueoriented

gregg was awarded the chartered financial analyst designation in  about usstrategyteam our team focuses on internally sourced ideas built from the bottom up we cull our information from company filings and industry statistics consciously avoiding the pull of wall street opinion and bias because the companies we follow are typically outoffavor with the investment community we seldom get caught up in fads or consensus thinking   kestrel investment management  strategy investment strategy overview kestrel specializes in analyzing restructurings such as corporate share repurchases spinoffs and asset sales in order to identify companies where management is actively working to increase shareholder value our experience and research over more than thirty years convince us that companies selected from this segment are more likely to produce superior longterm returns for their shareholders we invest in companies with managements who have implicitly identified their stock as undervalued and who are taking concrete steps to improve their share valuation for this reason we find the riskreturn relationship of our approach to be particularly attractive   our investment approach a purely bottomup value manager we are often asked to fit the kestrel strategy into a particular defined investment style are we “value” “growth” “sectordriven” while our strategy may include aspects of each at any given time we are a purely bottomup value investor the degree to which our portfolio resembles other designated styles from quartertoquarter is merely the result of our unique investment process rather than that of any preconceived mandate negative screen approach to stock selection when it comes to picking stocks we look at things differently our process is meticulous we follow all the stocks in our defined universe us companies listed on a national exchange with market capitalizations of  million to  billion that are undergoing some sort of voluntary restructuring and then apply a negative screen to eliminate companies that don’t meet our requirements be they fundamental or governance related we’ve found that our negative screening process helps us avoid the bias that occurs when managers become enamored with their stocks we would characterize our approach as objective and systematic this is not to say that we are a quantitative manager we use traditional tools in our analysis with a strong focus on cash flow and thoughtful consideration of companyspecific corporate governance why smallcap orientation kestrel’s smallcap orientation stems from our observation that shares of companies lacking institutional coverage are more likely to be inefficiently priced we also find that companies in the smallcap arena provide us with clearer management signals an important component of our investment process in contrast restructurings at larger capitalized companies are undertaken more regularly and are motivated by a host of other factors unrelated to share valuation unconstrained longterm focus we are not constrained by industry considerations companies undergoing restructuring can be found across sectors and the available opportunity set at any given time tends to reflect where value is present we are not market timers nor are we macroeconomic forecasters we believe that our comparative advantage resides in discerning unrecognized microeconomic trends and identifying misperceived factors we avoid the pitfalls of wall street’s notorious shortterm focus by holding individual stocks for an average period of eighteen months to three years about usstrategyteam we strive to accurately gauge the motivations of senior management in order to identify those companies that are restructuring for the benefit of shareholders we find the smallcap segment to be a rich and fertile environment for investment ideas investment style contrarian smallcap manager highly skilled at evaluating management motivation low beta portfolio
