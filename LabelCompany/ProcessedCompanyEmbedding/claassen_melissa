chief financial officer taylormade golf company by joyce a glazer published   am melissa claassen chief financial officer taylormade golf company sponsored by where are you from i was born in australia but i have lived in several countries i started my adidas career in australia and moved up through the ranks working in china hong kong taiwan and most recently germany my parents were firstgeneration immigrants from holland i grew up speaking dutch but now my german is better than my dutch after spending three years working at adidas headquarters in germany english is my third language how long have you been in san diego i moved here  months ago when i was promoted to my current position fortunately my husband edo fuijkschot is an illustration artist so he can live and work anywhere we have a fiveyearold daughter lana how did you advance your career it was not a planned path for me it was really being flexible and recognizing opportunities when i was in australia i realized the cfo was going to be there for a while so i decided to look beyond adidas he suggested that i stay with adidas and look beyond australia to explore other opportunities my next move was with adidas global who was your role model the managing director of adidas group greater china he encouraged me to learn the marketing side of the business and then i began to think about how to activate the brand to get some commercial sensibilities i believe that the “new cfo” is a business partner and copilot rather than the “numbers cruncher” of the past as a financial professional i interact with the marketing product sales and retail teams i see every facet of the business through the numbers what obstacles have you had to overcome as a woman sports is a maledominated industry but i never defined myself as a woman i am however the first woman board member in taylormade golf company i think they were more afraid than i was what do you consider to be your greatest accomplishment in  i was named one of the top  australian women leaders at the  for the future advance women’s leadership summit the honorable julia gillard australian prime minister addressed the summit then in  i was honored with the “best people leader” voted by financial people from around the adidas group what else should we know about you i believe in the financial world it’s all about transparencies we should present the best information possible i have been with the company for  years i have to feel the company that i am working for is doing a good thing in supporting their community since i moved to san diego i have joined the edc board and the ymca board plus participating in teamsponsored events at the young age of  you were promoted to worldwide cfo where to from here my career was built around innovation and challenging the status quo i am all about moving out of your comfort zone i have no future plan just open to all opportunities edit moduleshow tags

before i recently purchased it from plant therapy i really like it i am prone to panic attacks and just sniffing melissa for a few seconds is very tranquilizing and calming using melissa has helped prevent and deal with the after affects of having panic attacks you do not need a lot of it which will stretch your supply if you use too much melissa or diffuse it for too long it will withdraw maybe too much body mucous dries your body out and relaxes your muscles a bit too much enjoy it in small doses when you need it it is so helpful for those with anxiety disorders like ptsd as well as for daily anxiety the best thing about it you have feelings of joy and peace and your heart begins to sing again so uplifting kristi on january   recommended miracle oil i suffer from occasional canker sores and theres nothing that helps like melissa nothing ive used dentist prescribed mouthwash other eos over the counter medications and the only thing that relieves the pain and quickly heals the sore is melissa i know its expensive but for me its more valuable than a prescription costing the same amount of money because it works its also great for depression calming and soothing i never want to be without this oil ww on january   recommended worth the investment i absolutely love this oil in blends i put a couple of drops on a cotton ball and placed in my guitar case im rewarded with a faint scent of melissa every time i play so soothing and relaxing the price initially scared me but im so glad i made the investment melissa is quickly becoming one of my bedtime favorites melissa on

therapy essential oils all rights reserved ecommerce design  shopping cart software by miva inc questions feedback powered by olark live chat software essential oils  plant therapy faqs your cart is currently empty shop all my account cart product related questions q are plant therapy’s essential oils therapeutic grade a all of plant therapy’s oils are  pure free from any additives adulterants or dilutions they are of the absolute highest quality and are ideal for use in aromatherapy since there is no organization that oversees the quality of essential oils ‘therapeutic grade’ is simply a marketing term any company can say their oils are therapeutic grade some companies use other therapeutic grade terms or other grading or certifying terms for internal quality standards however these terms are often trademarked by the company when looking for the highest quality oils don’t look for terms such as ‘therapeutic grade’ since any company can use this term since there is no actual third party grading or certifying of essential oils it is best to look for a company that ensures the quality of their oils based on test results and experts some tests that are important when ensuring the quality of an essential oil are gcms gas chromatographmass spectrometer tests and organoleptic test please head on over to plant therapy’s ‘quality’ page to read more about what we do to guarantee our oils are of the highest quality q are plant therapy’s essential oils organic a many are but not all we work very hard with our suppliers to provide oils that come from organically grown plants that being said we only carry a small line of certified organic oils these oils are clearly labeled and our line of certified organic oils and synergies is continually growing if you are looking for a guarantee that the oil was grown organically and follows the organic standards we recommend you purchase our certified organic oils since many small farmers cannot afford to certify their organically grown plants the only way to guarantee the oil is organic is to purchase a certified organic oil q can plant therapy’s essential oils be used internally a we do not recommend the general internal use of essential oils essential oils are highly concentrated and have the capacity to cause serious damage if used internally without the necessary expertise required in administering them we do have customers who choose to use our oils internally however we recommend it only be done with great respect for the power of essential oils under the direction of someone who is qualified in the internal use of essential oils and someone who truly understands the chemical makeup of each individual oil and not on a daily basis q are any of plant therapy’s essential oils redistilled st nd rd distillation a most essential oils do not need to be redistilled the only time this happens is if you are trying to remove some of the minor constituents found in the essential oil most often this is done for the food flavoring industry this is also done for toxic substances such as hydrocyanic acid cyanide in bitter almond oil because cyanide is so toxic this oil is legally required to be redistilled in these cases the plant would be distilled and then the essential oil would be fractionally distilled or redistilled to remove these minor constituents the only oil that we carry that has been fractionally distilled is our bergamot bergamot is a highly phototoxic essential oil plant therapy’s bergamot is known as bergapten free this means that the chemical constituent that makes bergamot so phototoxic bergapten has been removed from our bergamot making it safe to use in the sun q how are plant therapy’s essential oils extracted a most of plant therapy’s essential oils are extracted using steam distillation our citrus oils are extracted using cold pressed extraction we also carry a few co extracted oils and also a few solvent extracted absolutes here is some more information about the different methods of extraction steam distillation the most common process of extracting an essential oil is by distillation a process that isolates the aromatic volatile element of the plant with steam cold pressed expression or cold pressing is used primarily for citrus fruits like orange and lemon where the essential oil is obtained in tiny pockets in the peel or rind oils extracted by cold pressing are the most volatile of essential oils and can evaporate quickly when exposed to air co extraction the co extraction method yields a greater number of aromatic compounds than any other distillation process making this extraction method one of our personal favorites in certain conditions at a low temperature carbon dioxide or co can be pressurized to become a liquid this liquid then acts as a solvent and is used to extract the oil from plants after extraction is completed the extraction vessel is brought back to normal temperature and the co rapidly converts to gas leaving behind a high quality oil that is free of solvents solvent extraction only used for absolutes flowers too delicate to be processed with heat are soaked in a solvent usually hexane that extracts the volatile elements the solvent is then evaporated leaving only the most fragrant constituents behind this process produces what is called an absolute here is a more in depth step by step process  plant material is macerated in a solvent usually hexane  after several days the solvent is removed leaving the viscous fragrant concrete  the concrete is dissolved with high proof alcohol  the mixture is chilled and separates into plant waxes and fragrant tincture  the fragrant tincture is vacuum distilled to evaporate off the alcohol leaving an absolute all absolutes are extracted using solvent extraction usage related questions q why are some oils unsafe to use on or around children a there are many reasons why some essential oils are not recommended to be used on or around children some of these reasons are toxicity concerns adverse skin reactions and breathing problems children are more at risk because they are smaller and therefore more susceptible to toxic substances their metabolism is less effective than an adults their skin is thinner and not as mature as an adults and they are more susceptible to respiratory issues to view a list of oils that are safe to use on or around children please visit our kidsafe section q why should certain oils be avoided during pregnancy a certain essentials oils are considered too powerful for use during pregnancy as they may stimulate the production of certain hormones and can encourage bleeding please consult your physician or contact our aromatherapists at aromatherapistplanttherapycom before using essential oils while pregnant q do i need to dilute plant therapy’s essential oils when using topically a short answer yes essential oils are volatile meaning that they evaporate very quickly when you dilute essential oils the evaporation process is much slower because they are diluted in nonvolatile substances the carrier oil then carries the essential oil into the skin which means that you can use less essential oil additionally the therapeutic benefits of a carrier oil often increases the therapeutic benefits of the essential oil policies and procedures q do you offer samples a at this time we do not offer samples we offer a  customers satisfaction along with free shipping and free return shipping with our great prices we recommend that you try out some of our oils that you are interested in trying we
