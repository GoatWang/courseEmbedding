company during its early years the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on mack avenue and later its factory on piquette avenue in detroit michigan groups of two or three men worked on each car assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for ford within a decade the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept and ford soon brought much of the part production inhouse in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era henry ford was  years old when he founded the ford motor company which would go on to become one of the worlds largest and most profitable companies it has been in continuous family control for over  years and is one of the largest familycontrolled companies in the world

being common to both companies later on the ford taunus and ford cortina became identical produced in left hand drive and right hand drive respectively rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the uk switched to elsewhere in europe including belgium and spain as well as germany the ford sierra replaced the taunus and cortina in  drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling which was soon given nicknames the jellymould and the salesmans spaceship in february  ford ended car production in the uk it was the first time in  years that ford cars had not

family cars in europe at the time of its launch but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with british buyers in particular it was still selling well when replaced by the more practical escort in  the third incarnation of the ford escort was launched in  and marked the companys move from rearwheel drive saloons to frontwheel drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector the fourth generation escort was produced from  until  although its successor – the focus – had been on sale since  on its launch the focus was arguably the most dramaticlooking and finehandling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next generation focus at the end of  the  ford sierra – replacement for the longrunning and massively popular cortina and taunus models – was a stylesetter at the time of its launch its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy sharpedged cortina and it was massively popular just

a joint venture with mazda called auto alliance now based in the bowin sub district of the sriracha district in chonburi the factory still produces passenger automobiles the factory built in  in

with israel ford and lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates are the biggest markets ford also established itself in egypt in  but faced an uphill battle during the s due to the hostile nationalist business environment fords distributor in saudi arabia announced in february  that it had sold  ford and lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in november  half of the fordlincoln vehicles sold in that country were ford crown victorias in  ford sold  units in the region falling far short of general motors  units and nissan motors  units south america during much of the th century ford faced protectionist government measures in south america with the result that it built different models in different countries without particular regard to rationalization or economy of scale inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations in many cases new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with or whose factories it had acquired for example the corcel and del rey in brazil were originally based on renault vehicles in  ford of brazil and ford of argentina merged their operations with the brazilian and argentine operations of volkswagen group forming a new jointventure company called autolatina with a shared model range sales figures and profitability were disappointing and autolatina was dissolved in  with the advent of mercosur the regional common market ford was finally able to rationalize its product lineups in those countries consequently the ford fiesta and ford ecosport are only built in brazil and the ford focus only built in argentina with each plant exporting in large volumes to the

cars a day at its factory on mack avenue and later its factory on piquette avenue in detroit michigan groups of two or three men worked on each car assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for ford within a decade the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept and ford soon brought much of the part production inhouse in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era henry ford was  years old when he founded the ford motor company which would go on to become one of the worlds largest and most profitable companies it has been in continuous family control for over  years and is one of the largest familycontrolled companies in the world the first gasoline powered automobile had been created

common to both companies later on the ford taunus and ford cortina became identical produced in left hand drive and right hand drive respectively rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the uk switched to elsewhere in europe including belgium and spain as well as germany the ford sierra replaced the taunus and cortina in  drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling which was soon given nicknames the jellymould and the salesmans spaceship in february  ford ended car production in the uk it was the first time in  years that ford cars had not

family cars in europe at the time of its launch but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with british buyers in particular it was still selling well when replaced by the more practical escort in  the third incarnation of the ford escort was launched in  and marked the companys move from rearwheel drive saloons to frontwheel drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector the fourth generation escort was produced from  until  although its successor – the focus – had been on sale since  on its launch the focus was arguably the most dramaticlooking and finehandling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next generation focus at the end of  the  ford sierra – replacement for the longrunning and massively

vehicles since commencing sales in november  half of the fordlincoln vehicles sold in that country were ford crown victorias in  ford sold  units in the region falling far short of general motors  units and nissan motors  units south america during much of the th century ford faced protectionist government measures in south america with the result that it built different models in different countries without particular regard to rationalization or economy of scale inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations in many cases new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with or whose factories it had acquired for example the corcel and del rey in brazil were originally based on renault vehicles in  ford of brazil and ford of argentina merged their operations with the brazilian and argentine operations of volkswagen group forming a new jointventure company called autolatina with a shared model range sales figures and profitability were disappointing and autolatina was dissolved in  with the advent of mercosur the regional common market ford was finally able to rationalize its product lineups in those countries consequently the ford fiesta and ford ecosport are only built in brazil and the ford focus only built in argentina with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries models like the ford mondeo from europe could now be imported completely built up ford of brazil produces a pickup truck version of the fiesta the courier which is also produced

american to form the south african motor corporation samcor following international condemnation of apartheid ford divested from south africa in  and sold its stake in samcor although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company samcor began to assemble mazdas as well which affected its product lineup and saw the european fords like the escort and sierra replaced by the mazdabased laser and telstar ford bought a  per cent stake in samcor following the demise of apartheid in  and this later became once again a wholly owned subsidiary the ford motor company of southern africa ford now sells a local sedan version of the fiesta also built in india and mexico and the focus the falcon model from australia was also sold in south africa but was dropped in  while the mondeo after briefly

the henry ford company on november   which became the cadillac motor company on august   after ford left with the rights to his name the ford motor company was launched in a converted factory in  with  in cash from twelve investors most notably john and horace dodge who would later found their own car company during its early years the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on mack avenue and later its factory on piquette avenue in detroit michigan groups of two or three men worked on each car assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for ford within a decade the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept and ford soon brought much of the part production inhouse in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era henry ford was  years old when he founded the ford motor company which would go on to become one of the worlds largest and most profitable companies it has been in continuous family control for over  years and is one of the largest familycontrolled companies in the world the first gasoline powered automobile had been created in  by the german inventor carl benz benz patentmotorwagen more efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for the middle class to which ford contributed by for instance introducing the first moving assembly line in  at the ford factory in highland park between  and  ford produced the models a b c f k n r and s hundreds or a few thousand of most of these were sold per year in  ford introduced the massproduced model t which totalled millions sold over nearly  years in  ford replaced the t with the model a the first car with safety glass in the windshield ford launched the first lowpriced car with a v engine in  in an attempt to compete with general motors midpriced pontiac oldsmobile and buick ford created the mercury in  as a higherpriced companion car to ford henry ford purchased the lincoln motor company in  in order to compete with such brands as cadillac and packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market in  ford was contracted by the government of the soviet union to set up the gorky automobile plant in russia initially producing ford model a and aas thereby playing an important role in the industrialisation of that country the creation of a scientific laboratory in dearborn michigan in  doing unfettered basic research led to fords unlikely involvement in superconductivity research in  ford research labs made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or squid ford offered the lifeguard safety package from  which included such innovations as a standard deepdish steering wheel optional front and for the first time in a car rear seatbelts and an optional padded dash ford introduced childproof door locks into its products in  and in the same year offered the first retractable hardtop on a massproduced sixseater car in late  ford established the continental division as a separate luxury car division this division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous continental mark ii at the same time the edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the  model year due to limited sales of the continental and the edsel disaster ford merged lincoln mercury and edsel into mel which reverted to lincolnmercury after edsels november  demise the ford mustang was introduced in  in  ford introduced the seat belt reminder light with the s ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world during the s ford began using the advertising slogan have you driven a ford lately to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern in

and low fuel prices with the dawn of the new century legacy health care costs higher fuel prices and a faltering economy led to falling market shares declining sales and diminished profit margins most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through ford motor credit company st century william clay ford jr greatgrandson of henry ford serves as the executive chairman at the board of ford motor company by  both ford and gms corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status as a result of high us health care costs for an aging workforce soaring gasoline prices eroding market share and an over dependence on declining suv sales profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased incentives in the form of rebates or low interest financing to offset declining demand in the latter half of  chairman bill ford asked newly appointed ford americas division president mark fields to develop a plan to return the company to profitability fields previewed the plan named the way forward at the december   board meeting of the company and it was unveiled to the public on january   the way forward included resizing the company to match market realities dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models consolidating production lines closing  factories and cutting  jobs ford moved to introduce a range of new vehicles including crossover suvs built on unibody car platforms rather than more bodyonframe chassis in developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the ford escape hybrid suv ford licensed similar toyota hybrid technologies to avoid

systems will work with the electrical grid under the multimilliondollar multiyear project ford will convert a demonstration fleet of ford escape hybrids into plugin hybrids and sce will evaluate how

independently run voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the companys books thereby improving its balance sheet this arrangement took

prepaid us million of its future liabilities to the fund the agreement also gives hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories the automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in  of  billion and estimated that it would not return to profitability until  however ford surprised wall street in the second quarter of  by posting a  million profit despite the gains the company finished the year with a  billion loss largely attributed to finance restructuring at volvo on june   ford sold its jaguar and land rover operations to tata motors for  billion during congressional hearings held in november  at washington dc and in a show of support fords alan mulally stated that we at ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity but we also must prepare ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions mulally went on to state that the collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on ford and that ford motor companys supports both chrysler and general motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the  financial crisis together the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry mulally stated that in addition to our plan we are also here today to request support for the industry in the nearterm ford does not require access to a government bridge loan however we request a credit line of  billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive

crown victorias in  ford sold  units in the region falling far short of general motors  units and nissan motors  units south america during much of the th century ford faced protectionist government measures in south america with the result that it built different models in different countries without particular regard to rationalization or economy of scale inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations in many cases new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with or whose factories it had acquired for example the corcel and del rey in brazil were originally based on renault vehicles in  ford of brazil and ford of argentina merged their operations with the brazilian and argentine operations of volkswagen group forming a new jointventure company called autolatina with a shared model range sales figures and profitability were disappointing and autolatina was dissolved in  with
