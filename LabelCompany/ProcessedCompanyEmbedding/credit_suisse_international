orders payment of penalties totaling  by credit suisse international for violating the speculative position limit for wheat futures and by credit suisse securities usa llc for submitting false or misleading information mar   the us commodity futures trading commission cftc issued an order filing and settling charges that credit suisse international csi of london uk exceeded the cftc allmonths speculative position limit for the chicago board of trade cbot wheat futures contracts on several days in april and june  despite having been granted an increased hedge exemption by the cftc the cftc order also finds that credit suisse securities usa llc cssusa based in new york ny submitted to the cftcs division of enforcement enforcement in its investigation of this matter materially false or misleading information reflecting certain inflated swap positions and thus inflated hedge exemptions for cbot wheat futures contracts for cssusa csi and other affiliates for several days in april and june  the order finds that despite having received an increased hedge exemption that increased its allmonths position limit in cbot wheat futures contracts csi nevertheless exceeded its increased allmonths position limit on several days in april and june  for example on april   csi had an allmonths cbot wheat future net long position of  contracts which exceeded its increased position limit by  contracts the order further finds that in march  cssusa submitted to enforcement through counsel documents purporting to reflect among other information credit suisses futures position related to its credit migratory exemption for the relevant days in april and june  while the march  submission purportedly reflected that credit suisse had larger credit migratory swap positions and thus larger hedge exemptions in april and june  than had been previously reported to the cftc the submission in fact reflected inflated credit migratory swap positions and thus inflated hedge exemptions making them materially false or misleading the cftc order requires csi to pay a  civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from further violations of section ab of the commodity exchange act cea and cftc regulation  as charged for the false statements charge cssusa is required to pay a  civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from further violations of section c of the cea as charged

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
