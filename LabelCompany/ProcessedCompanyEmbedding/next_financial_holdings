of nxgh and nxtgn inc a subsidiary of nxgh versus defendant viber media inc  the litigation being heard in new york southern district court asserts that viber misused confidential information that the plaintiffs communicated to viber pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement publicly available documents show that on march   district judge richard j sullivan denied vibers motion to dismiss on three of the four claims in the lawsuit in any lawsuit the outcome is always pure speculation but next group holdings intends to share any net proceeds from a favorable ruling with its shareholders this is being committed to through the issuance of a special dividend of newly created class d redeemable preferred stock nxgh shareholders are eligible to receive one share of the new class of stock for each share of nxgh common stock held as of the record date of june   only noninsiders of nxgh are eligible for the special dividend otc markets shows  million shares of nxgh in the public float redeemable

that shorts have been aggressively shorting nxgh on a daily basis with an average of  of daily trading volume being short selling if naked shorting is happening which is always difficult to prove
