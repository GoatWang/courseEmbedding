the past  years vaccines  agenus locations contact us harnessing the immune system checkpoint program vaccines adjuvants combination therapies vaccines at agenus our extensive experience in immunooncology has led us to the forefront of cancer candidates with our three platform technologies prophage™ an individualized vaccine made from a patient’s own tumor tissue autosynvax™ a vaccine uniquely designed and manufactured for each patient based on their tumor profile phosphosynvax™ an offtheshelf vaccine targeting a novel class of tumor antigens all three platforms are designed to treat cancers based on the unique needs of each patient most cancer cells carry unique mutations or biochemical signatures for example protein phosphorylation patterns that are not present in healthy cells our vaccines are either based on these specific mutations found in the tumor cells of the patient or on aberrantly phosphorylated proteins that are specific to different types of cancer andor patient our platforms are designed to alert the patient’s immune system to recognize these differences by targeting mutant protein antigens the result would be to attack cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unaffected prophage™ vaccine the prophage vaccine platform involves extracting peptides protein fragments from a patient’s tumor that are naturally bound to heat shock protein gp hsppc allowing us to identify key proteins of interest subsequently prophage is designed to mobilize multiple immune processes to attack the tumor we are currently conducting clinical trials of prophage vaccines in glioblastoma a form of brain cancer the standard of care treatment for glioblastoma is surgical resection when possible followed by radiation and chemotherapy with today’s treatments the vast majority of patients survive only  months or less at asco in june of  we reported results from a singlearm openlabel multiinstitutional phase  trial of prophage in newly diagnosed glioblastoma ndgbm in combination with the standard of care treatment of surgical resection radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy we reported that patients with ndgbm had a substantial improvement both in progressionfree survival and overall survival with prophage combined with standard of care compared to historical control data in addition it was found that the most significant improvements median progressionfree survival approximating  months median overall survival approximating  months were seen in the seventeen patients with less elevated expression of the checkpoint protein pdl on the circulating cells known as peripheral blood monocytes this suggests that patients who are thought to be less immunosuppressed when first diagnosed with ndgbm could benefit from adding prophage vaccination to standard of care it also raises the possibility that prophage may be beneficial in the other half of patients who are more immunosuppressed those who have greater pdl expression on peripheral blood monocytes at baseline by adding checkpoint modulators that block pd or pdl to prophage plus the standard of care autosynvax™ vaccine the immune system has the capacity to “see” cancer antigens or mutated molecules on cancer cells as foreign or abnormal and unleash an attack that destroys these cancerous cells however the number of mutations varies from one patient’s tumor to another current research suggests that our natural immune defense mechanisms may be insufficient to eliminate cancers in cases where mutations are too few in number even when cancer cells display many mutations they can evade effective recognition by the immune system through a variety of immunosuppressive mechanisms agenus’ autosynvax cancer vaccine is being designed to boost immune recognition of cancer antigens to a higher level than that which is achieved naturally the vaccine therefore may help the immune system better recognize cancer antigens even if there are only a small number of them on a given patient’s tumor autosynvax is expected to work synergistically with other forms of immunotherapy including checkpoint inhibitors and other checkpoint modulators that counteract immune evasion mechanisms autosynvax is an individualized vaccine made by combining synthetic versions of each patient’s own cancer antigens with heat shock protein  hsp hsp is known to transport protein fragments called epitopes and to play a part in displaying them to t cells immune cells that when sufficiently activated can mount a potent antitumor response we identify the unique genetic sequence of an individual patient’s cancer and apply proprietary computational tools to predict which mutations unique to that patient are likely to be displayed by the tumor in the form of “neoepitopes” accurate prediction of these neoepitopes increases the likelihood that our autosynvax vaccine will stimulate a robust t cell response against tumors we then synthesize these neoepitopes in the form of short peptide sequences after linking these peptides to hsp in our gmpcertified manufacturing facility we plan to administer autosynvax vaccine along with our qs stimulon® adjuvant to provide maximum efficacy  by including numerous synthetic cancer antigens in each patient’s autosynvax vaccine we increase the likelihood that tumors will be recognized by the immune system phosphosynvax™ vaccine our third vaccine platform is phosphosynvax based on technology we obtained when we acquired phosimmune phosphosynvax is being designed to induce immunity against a novel class of tumor specific neoepitopes those arising from inappropriate phosphorylation of various proteins in malignant cells in cancer cells the disruption of normal biochemical signaling can result in aberrant protein phosphorylation the addition of phosphate groups on sites that would not be altered in normal cells some of these misphosphorylated proteins can be processed into antigens by the cellular machinery resulting in presentation of this new type of antigen on the cell surface we have a library of more than one thousand proprietary phosphopeptide tumor target antigens characteristic of many different cancers including lung cancer specific leukemias ovarian cancer colon cancer and others we believe that using our phosphosynvax vaccines to teach the immune system to recognize these neoepitopes can lead to the destruction of cancer cells this technology is thus unique to agenus and potentially very powerful in various patients across cancer types careers  agenus locations contact us working

lexington massachusettsbased biotechnology company focused on immunotherapy including immunooncology a field that uses the power of the immune system to control or cure cancer the company is developing checkpoint modulators cpms patientspecific anticancer vaccines and adjuvants that can be used with a range of vaccines cpm development is a particularly fastmoving field since early products have produced unprecedented clinical benefits for patients in light of the advances made science magazine hailed cancer immunotherapy as its  breakthrough of the year contents  history  key partners and deals  product descriptions  references  articles historyedit agenus formerly antigenics inc was founded in  by garo h armen and pramod k srivastava the company has pioneered immunotherapies including heat shock proteinbased cancer vaccines a program that has developed into its prophage series of personalized anticancer vaccines antigenics became a public company in february  on the nasdaq exchange with the ticker symbol agen in  agenus acquired aquila biopharmaceuticals and a year later it acquired aronex pharmaceuticals in february  the company acquired a european firm antibody along with their portfolio of checkpoint modulators cpms and a platform retrocyte display® technology to rapidly and efficiently discover new antibodies ceo garo armen in october  agenus ceo garo armen issued a press release revealing that after an month follow up on the rtss malaria vaccine using qsstimulon® is working well enough to support a regulatory filing in  this is the first proof of the efficacy of agenuss patented qs stimulon adjuvant  in april  agenus inked a deal with merck potentially worth  million under the terms of that deal agenus is using its proprietary retrocyte display technology to discover antibodies against a pair of undisclosed checkpoint targets for the treatment of cancer agenus has advanced two of its own cpm candidates into early drug development and the company is planning to advance several more antibodies in clinical trials today agenus is focused on developing a range of immunooncology products including the prophage vaccines multiple checkpoint modulators also known as checkpoint inhibitors or checkpoint antibodies and its qsstimulon adjuvant the company’s personalized heat shock proteinbased vaccines are in phase  studies the qs stimulon adjuvant platform is partnered with glaxosmithkline and janssen several of those collaborations involve phase  trials altogether the company and its partners are sponsoring approximately  clinical trials of agenus products key partners and dealsedit merck april  agenus announced a deal worth potentially  million with merck the deal involves the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies to two undisclosed merck checkpoint targets both thought to be relevant for cancer treatment agenus will use its proprietary retrocyte display® platform to discover and optimize antibodies against the targets antibody february  agenus acquired european biotechnology firm antibody along with its retrocyte display technology and a portfolio of checkpoint modulator antibody candidates  ludwig cancer research antibody had been working on the checkpoint targets for several years in collaboration with ludwig cancer research one of the world’s most renowned institutions for research into cancer and the immune system the leader of the ludwig collaborative laboratory at memorial sloan kettering cancer center jedd wolchok is recognized as one of immunooncology’s leading pioneers glaxosmithkline gsk march  gsk paid agenus  million to include additional rights to the two firms’ agreement around agenus’ qs stimulon® adjuvant the deal amended license and manufacturing terms it also included royalty payments to agenus for an undisclosed indication upon commercialization of a vaccine product descriptionsedit checkpoint modulators cpms interfere with cancers’ ability to “hijack” natural immune defense systems to protect the body against disease but without attacking healthy cells the immune system uses multiple “checkpoint” systems some checkpoints stimulate immune responses while others inhibit them cancer cells can evolve means to evade checkpoints and cpms can reverse that effect helping the immune system better fight the cancer agenus currently has programs targeting the checkpoint modulators gitr ox ctla lag tim and pd the company is expanding that portfolio by using its proprietary retrocyte display® discovery

pharmaceutical company founders garo h armen pramod k srivastava headquarters  forbes road lexington massachusetts website wwwagenusbiocom agenus is a lexington massachusettsbased biotechnology company focused on immunotherapy including immunooncology a field that uses the power of the immune system to control or cure cancer the company is developing checkpoint modulators cpms patientspecific anticancer vaccines and adjuvants that can be used with a range of vaccines cpm development is a particularly fastmoving field since early products have produced unprecedented clinical benefits for patients in light of the advances made science magazine hailed cancer immunotherapy as its  breakthrough of the year contents  history  key partners and deals  product descriptions  references  articles historyedit agenus formerly antigenics inc was founded in  by garo h armen and pramod k srivastava the company has pioneered immunotherapies including heat shock proteinbased cancer vaccines a program that has developed into its prophage series of personalized anticancer vaccines antigenics became a public company in february  on the nasdaq exchange with the ticker symbol agen in  agenus acquired aquila biopharmaceuticals and a year later it acquired aronex pharmaceuticals in february  the company acquired a european firm antibody along with their portfolio of checkpoint modulators cpms and a platform retrocyte display® technology to rapidly and efficiently discover new antibodies ceo garo armen in october  agenus ceo garo armen issued a press release revealing that after an month follow up on the rtss malaria vaccine using qsstimulon® is working well enough to support a regulatory filing in  this is the first proof of the efficacy of agenuss patented qs stimulon adjuvant  in april  agenus inked a deal with merck potentially worth  million under the terms of that deal agenus is using its proprietary retrocyte display technology to discover antibodies against a pair of undisclosed checkpoint targets for the treatment of cancer agenus has advanced two of its own cpm candidates into early drug development and the company is planning to advance several more antibodies in clinical trials today agenus is focused on developing a range of immunooncology products including the prophage vaccines multiple checkpoint modulators also known as checkpoint inhibitors or checkpoint antibodies and its qsstimulon adjuvant the company’s personalized heat shock proteinbased vaccines are in phase  studies the qs stimulon adjuvant platform is partnered with glaxosmithkline and janssen several of those collaborations involve phase  trials altogether the company and its partners are sponsoring approximately  clinical trials of agenus products key partners and dealsedit merck april  agenus announced a deal worth potentially  million with merck the deal involves the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies to two undisclosed merck checkpoint targets both thought to be relevant for cancer treatment agenus will use its proprietary retrocyte display® platform to discover and optimize antibodies against the targets antibody february  agenus acquired european biotechnology firm antibody along with its retrocyte display technology and a portfolio of checkpoint modulator antibody candidates  ludwig cancer research antibody had been working on the checkpoint targets for several years in collaboration with ludwig cancer research one of the world’s most renowned institutions for research into cancer and the immune system the leader of the ludwig collaborative laboratory at memorial sloan kettering cancer center jedd wolchok is recognized as one of immunooncology’s leading pioneers glaxosmithkline gsk march  gsk paid agenus  million to include additional rights to the two firms’ agreement around agenus’ qs stimulon® adjuvant the deal amended license and manufacturing terms it also included royalty payments to agenus for an undisclosed indication upon commercialization of a vaccine product descriptionsedit checkpoint modulators cpms interfere with cancers’ ability to “hijack” natural immune defense systems to protect the body against disease but without attacking healthy cells the immune system uses multiple “checkpoint” systems some checkpoints stimulate immune responses while others inhibit them cancer cells can evolve means to evade checkpoints and cpms can reverse that effect helping the immune system better fight the cancer agenus currently has programs targeting the checkpoint modulators gitr ox ctla lag tim and pd the company is expanding that portfolio by using its proprietary retrocyte display® discovery system to generate fully human therapeutic antibody drug candidates the platform is a highthroughput approach incorporating igg format human antibody libraries expressed in mammalian blineage cells the prophage series of patientspecific cancer vaccine candidates can also enhance the immune system’s response to tumors because each cancer is unique the vaccine is derived from the patient’s own tumor sample to process these samples agenus has established a multiproduct good manufacturing practices gmp facility which has already helped process over  tumor samples from across the globe the companys qs stimulon® adjuvant platform strengthens and broadens immune responses to antigens on cancers or foreign invaders’ surfaces agenus has multiple partnerships around this product to study its effects with vaccines for diseases including alzheimer’s melanoma and malaria in october  glaxosmithkline and agenus announced positive data from an month followup of gsk’s rtss malaria vaccine with qsstimulon gsk stated that the treatment was working well enough to support a regulatory filing rtss is the most advanced vaccine for malaria in development referencesedit  httpwwwnaturecomnaturejournalvnsuppfullsahtml

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
