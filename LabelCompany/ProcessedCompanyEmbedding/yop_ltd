wwwuopcom honeywell uop formerly known as uop llc or universal oil products is a multinational company developing and delivering technology to the petroleum refining gas processing petrochemical production and major manufacturing industries the companys roots date back to  when the revolutionary dubbs thermal cracking process created the technological foundation for todays modern refining industry in the ensuing decades uop engineers generated thousands of patents leading to important advances in process technology profitability consultation and equipment design contents  history  facilities  products  technologies  adsorption separation technology  renewable fuels technology  catalytic converter  see also  references  external links historyedit uop was founded in  to exploit the market potential of patents held by inventors jesse a dubbs and his son carbon petroleum c p dubbs perhaps because he was born in pennsylvania oil country jesse dubbs was enamored with the oil business he even named his son carbon after one of the elemental constituents of oil later carbon added the p to make his name euphonious he said people started calling him petroleum for fun and the name stuck c ps son and grandson were also named carbon but each had a different middle initial when founded in  it was a privately held firm known as the national hydrocarbon company j ogden armour provided initial seed money and kept the firm going the first years it lost money most of the losses were incurred during lengthy legal battles with petroleum firms that were using technology patented by dubbs in  the firms name became universal oil products by  petroleum firms saw a possible competitive advantage to owning uop a consortium of firms banded together to purchase the firm these firms were shell oil company standard oil company of california standard oil company of indiana standard oil company of new jersey the texas company and n v de bataafsche petroleum maatschappij this worried oil firms that were not part of the group and it helped prompt the justice department to begin an investigation of this arrangement as a possible violation of antitrust laws the oil firms placed the assets of uop into a trust to support the american chemical society in  uop went public and the income from that sale still provides monies to the american chemical society to administer grants to universities worldwide in august  union carbide corporation and alliedsignal formed a joint venture combining the latters wholly owned subsidiary uop inc and the catalyst adsorbents and process systems caps business of union carbide alliedsignal acquired honeywell in  and assumed the latters name in  what was now known as honeywell acquired union carbides stake in uop making it again a wholly owned subsidiary the reported payment to union carbide was  million valuing uop at  billion facilitiesedit a honeywell refinery producing green diesel from natural oils in pasadena texas the uop riverside research and development laboratory was conceived in  by hiram j halle the chief executive officer of universal oil products now simply uop as a focal point where the best and brightest scientists could create new products and provide scientific support for the oil refining industry between  and  riverside research resulted in  us and foreign patents and provided the foundation on which uop built its success the company benefited immensely by the addition to its research staff of professor vladimir ipatieff famous russian scientist known internationally for his work in highpressure catalysis his contribution in catalytic chemistry gave uop a position of leadership in the development of catalysis as applied to petroleum processing the first being catalytic polymerization vladimir haensel a student of ipatieff’s joined uop and developed platforming in the s this process used very small amounts of platinum as a catalyst for the high yield of highoctane gasoline from petroleumbased feeds the riverside facility was recognized as a national historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society in  productsedit uop products fall into two groupings physical products that can be seen and technology products that provide knowledge and design physical products tend to be items used within a refinery or petrochemical plant to help convert chemicals into a desired product technology products tend to be based upon the ability to convert one chemical into another refine crude oil and separate chemicals from each other for example one area of uops expertise is fluid catalytic cracking that breaks longchain hydrocarbons from crude oil into shorter compounds technologiesedit adsorption separation technologyedit distillation is the most common way to separate chemicals with different boiling points the greater the difference in boiling points the easier it is to do however when boiling points are too similar this isnt feasible adsorption separation might be possible in adsorption separation a mixture of chemicals flows past a porous solid called the adsorbent and some chemicals tend to hang out longer a valid analogy is to imagine a busy street with people walking in the same direction past great places to eat the hungriest people will tend to stop right away the people that were pretty full will make it far down the street now imagine flooding the whole town with water and everyone runs out where you can collect them according to how hungry they were in technical terms the liquid flush is called the desorbent this type of separation was first commonly used in the laboratory to separate small test samples uop pioneered a method of separating large volumes of chemicals they call the countercurrent embodiment of it the sorbex family of processes these are the major ones designed by uop parex separation of paraxylene from a mixture of xylene isomers mx sorbex separation of metaxylene from a mixed of xylene isomers molex linear paraffins from branched and cyclic hydrocarbons olex olefins from paraffins cresex paracresol or metacresol from other cresol isomers cymex paracymene or metacymene from other cymene isomers sarex fructose from mixed sugars renewable fuels technologyedit in  uop revealed its ecofining process which takes vegetable oils or lipids and converts them into replacements for diesel and jet fuels the resultant fuels from this refining process are indistinguishable from existing fossilbased petrodiesels and jet fuels catalytic converteredit most of uops work is not known to the general public since most applications are within refineries and petrochemical plants however one technology uop helped developed is familiar to automobile owners during the s uop worked on pioneering a combined muffler catalytic converter to help publicize their work they sponsored canam and formula one teams the race cars used were developed by shadow racing cars many race fans were drawn to the teams innovative designs and underdog status uop finally achieved a goal when california adopted the catalytic converter after the uop governmental relations rep donald gazzaniga helped push legislation through the state senate and assembly  see alsoedit catalytic reforming penex referencesedit  universal oil products retrieved    a b c d universal oil products uop riverside laboratory
