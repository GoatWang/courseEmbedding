chairman and chief executive officer abbott laboratories nationality american born  in minneapolis minnesota education stanford university bs  mba  family married wifes name unknown career mckinsey and company – management consultant abbott laboratories – sales manager in medical diagnostics then various management positions – senior vice president of diagnostic operations – executive vice president – chairman and ceo address abbott laboratories  abbott park road abbott park illinois  httpwwwabbottcom ■ as chairman and chief executive officer of the major pharmaceutical and healthcare products company abbott laboratories miles d white aggressively pursued new research and acquisitions strategies for his firm he oversaw a substantial increase in research funding for the development of new pharmaceuticals while trimming abbotts drug portfolio to focus on the most promising therapies under his leadership abbotts management team was restructured and working conditions were improved in order to attract and retain the best scientific talent analysts and colleagues described white as creative and driven and as an intelligent strategist who was a catalyst for change developing as a leader white gained his earliest experiences as a leader when he was a highschool student at culver military academy in indiana there white was taught leadership skills based on the servantleader model which emphasized the importance of serving others before taking any directive action he was able to miles d white stefan zaklingetty images  put these skills into practice in his roles as captain of a sports team and club president such opportunities inculcated white with the keen awareness that being an effective leader entailed acquiring an understanding of the needs of others whether they be fellow team members or stakeholders and then working to meet those needs although he majored in mechanical engineering at stanford white was drawn to leadership positions that inevitably led him in different directions as a senior white served as the financial manager for all student businesses at stanford—he was the first undergraduate to ever hold that position whites taste for executivelevel work led him to attend business school though he remained uncertain about the direction in which he would ultimately go rather than accepting a managerial position directly after earning his mba white joined mckinsey and company in  as a consultant he honed his skills in critical thinking at mckinsey and then looked for management positions in silicon valley he interviewed with the chicagobased abbott only as a favor to a mentor yet abbott proved to be the first company to offer white a management position and in  he became sales manager in abbotts domestic diagnostics division with responsibility for eight people and  million in sales race to the top white was then promoted through a series of management positions in abbotts diagnostics division including in marketing and research before being named head of the division in  as revenues from diagnostics had been growing at less than  percent annually when he took charge white was aggressive in pushing the division into new markets in  he spearheaded the  million acquisition of medisense allowing abbott to move into the expanding area of bloodglucose monitoring for diabetics under his guidance abbotts diagnostic sales grew  percent in —four times the industry average—and the divisions overall business grew from  billion in  to  billion in  in an increasingly competitive market amid concerns about the firms earnings growth and its position in relation to larger competitors such as pfizer abbotts chairman and ceo duane burnham as well as the president and coo thomas hodgson announced their planned retirements in  abbott set up a horse race for succession by elevating white and two other divisional chiefs to executive vice president positions the performance of whites diagnostics division was viewed by analysts as relatively flat in comparison to abbotts growing pharmaceuticals business which accounted for almost half of the companys sales and profits white also lacked any pharmaceutical experience and was regarded by many observers as the candidate least likely to be awarded the top job despite such predictions whites detailed plan for invigorating abbott and his confidence in handling pressure impressed the companys board of directors who ultimately tapped him for the post in  white assumed leadership of the  billion firm where he would face the challenge of reenergizing a company that analysts saw as vulnerable the challenges of reviving abbott although the company white inherited had produced steady earnings for decades it had also failed to keep pace with competitors in terms of spending on research and acquisitions at the time of whites appointment abbott spent  million on pharmaceutical rd well under the – billion analysts thought the company needed to spend in order to maintain a steady pipeline of new drugs abbotts existing pipeline was especially tight when white took the reins with one drug hytrin going generic and production of another abbokinase being halted by the fda because of manufacturing problems—the two situations together would lead to losses of about  million in sales unlike other pharmaceutical and healthcare product companies abbott had yet to pursue any large mergers to either expand its product line or ease pricing pressures white quickly took action to address abbotts research problems indicating that he would double rd funding for pharmaceuticals within the first three years of his tenure to bring discipline to the previously fragmented research program white restructured abbotts management team to coordinate research at the companywide level and recruited the wellknown scientist jeffrey leiden to head the pharmaceuticals group whites high expectations for results shaped his decision to cut back in fields of drug development that were less promising for abbott including cardiology urology and renal disease most controversially white halted the majority of abbotts basic research on hiv—beyond the one protease inhibitor already in the pipeline—an area in which he thought the company could not successfully compete he remarked i think if we are going to spend  billion on research and development i should expect scientists who think they are exceptional to do better than come up with a metoo product klein january   in order to quiet talk of a looming takeover and further fill abbotts weak drug pipeline white pursued an aggressive acquisitions strategy completing over  acquisitions licensing agreements and marketing arrangements in the early years of his tenure the deals included an option to buy  percent of supergen a developer of cancer drugs and a  million payment to neurosearch as for the right to develop its drugs for nervoussystem disorders not all of whites acquisitions went so smoothly however in june  he sought to acquire alza corporation a company with several drugdelivery technologies for  billion the deal collapsed due to antitrust concerns and a drop in abbotts share price in the wake of fda sanctions the failed alza acquisition along with continuing regulatory problems at abbotts manufacturing facility raised concerns about whites leadership although praised for bringing vitality and initiative to the historically conservative abbott culture analysts noted whites rough start and questioned his ability to effectively change the companys direction in a highly competitive environment white and abbott turn a corner although doubts lingered about whites leadership abbotts stock rebounded by  rising to  a share from a low of  company earnings rose as well hence despite the collapse of the alza deal white was in a position to continue aggressively pursuing acquisitions in  he successfully engineered a nearly  billion agreement with basf to buy its knoll pharmaceuticals division with the purchase of knoll abbott became the ninthlargest pharamceutical company in the world up from its prior rank of th although the deal dramatically increased abbotts debt while adding only  million to its operating income knoll brought an interesting drug pipeline that included humira a notyet launched therapy for treating rheumatoid arthritis as appealing as drugs like humira were white had also sought knoll out in order to provide abbott with a global infrastructure and expanded rd capacity including a new manufacturing facility in massachusetts after the acquisition white and his management team were under pressure to quickly integrate the two firms in order to move humira quickly to market as described in pharmaceutical executive  analysts credited white and other abbott executives with facilitating a smooth transition through their careful handson approach and commitment to preserving and empowering personnel december  humira was successfully launched in early  with sales projected to reach  million in  along with acquiring other firms white strongly emphasized the importance of attracting and retaining the best scientific talent he improved working conditions at his company by increasing vacation time and adding childcare services as was consistent with his own informal style white ordered the construction of volleyball and soccer fields at abbott headquarters to create a workforce that better reflected the companys stakeholders white oversaw a number of diversity initiatives increasing the number of minority personnel in management positions by  percent in five years and fostering leadership opportunities for women abbott was named to fortune s list of the  best companies for minorities every year since the list was conceived in  the firm was also placed among the top  on working mother s list of the best companies for working mothers after several years of acquisitions and a ramping up of research operations in  white announced that no new major purchases lay in abbotts immediate future still white began the year with the  billion acquisition of therasense the maker of diabetic testing tools moving abbott from the numberfive to the numberthree position in the bloodglucose monitoring market in lieu of looking for more external opportunities white then focused on consolidating abbotts operations to concentrate resources on core areas of strength—a strategy which entailed spinning off the  billion hospitalproducts division hospira after years of struggling to meet regulatory standards abbott was informed by the fda in  that its manufacturing facility was largely in compliance with industry regulations allowing the company to move forward with its medicaldiagnostics division although analysts remained uncertain about the longterm effects of whites strategies several agreed that abbott was strong enough to no longer be considered a serious takeover target and that whites aggressive and creative leadership had made a substantially beneficial impact on the company see also entry on abbott laboratories in international

■ as chairman and chief executive officer of the major pharmaceutical and healthcare products company abbott laboratories miles d white aggressively pursued new research and acquisitions strategies for his firm he oversaw a substantial increase in research funding for the development of new pharmaceuticals while trimming abbotts drug portfolio to focus on the most promising therapies under his leadership abbotts management team was restructured and working conditions were improved in order to attract and retain the best scientific talent analysts and colleagues described white as creative and driven and as an intelligent strategist who was a catalyst for change developing as a leader white gained his earliest experiences as a leader when he was a highschool student at culver military academy in indiana there white was taught leadership skills based on the servantleader model which emphasized the importance of serving others before taking any directive action he was able to put these skills into practice in his roles as captain of a sports team and club president such opportunities inculcated white with the keen awareness that being an effective leader entailed acquiring an understanding of the needs of others whether they be fellow team members or stakeholders and then working to meet those needs although he majored in mechanical engineering at stanford white was drawn to leadership positions that inevitably led him in different directions as a senior white served as the financial manager for all student businesses at stanford—he was the first undergraduate to ever hold that position whites taste for executivelevel work led him to attend business school though he remained uncertain about the direction in which he would ultimately go rather than accepting a managerial position directly after earning his mba white joined mckinsey and company in  as a consultant he honed his skills in critical thinking at mckinsey and then looked for management positions in silicon valley he interviewed with the chicagobased abbott only as a favor to a mentor yet abbott proved to be the first company to offer white a management position and in  he became sales manager in abbotts domestic diagnostics division with responsibility for eight people and  million in sales race to the top white was then promoted through a series of management positions in abbotts diagnostics division including in marketing and research before being named head of the division in  as revenues from diagnostics had been growing at less than  percent annually when he took charge white was aggressive in pushing the division into new markets in  he spearheaded the  million acquisition of medisense allowing abbott to move into the expanding area of bloodglucose monitoring for diabetics under his guidance abbotts diagnostic sales grew  percent in —four times the industry average—and the divisions overall business grew from  billion in  to  billion in  in an increasingly competitive market amid concerns about the firms earnings growth and its position in relation to larger competitors such as pfizer abbotts chairman and ceo duane burnham as well as the president and coo thomas hodgson announced their planned retirements in  abbott set up a horse race for succession by elevating white and two other divisional chiefs to executive vice president positions the performance of whites diagnostics division was viewed by analysts as relatively flat in comparison to abbotts growing pharmaceuticals business which accounted for almost half of the companys sales and profits white also lacked any pharmaceutical experience and was regarded by many observers as the candidate least likely to be awarded the top job despite such predictions whites detailed plan for invigorating abbott and his confidence in handling pressure impressed the companys board of directors who ultimately tapped him for the post in  white assumed leadership of the  billion firm where he would face the challenge of reenergizing a company that analysts saw as vulnerable the challenges of reviving abbott although the company white inherited had produced steady earnings for decades it had also failed to keep pace with competitors in terms of spending on research and acquisitions at the time of whites appointment abbott spent  million on pharmaceutical rd well under the – billion analysts thought the company needed to spend in order to maintain a steady pipeline of new drugs abbotts existing pipeline was especially tight when white took the reins with one drug hytrin going generic and production of another abbokinase being halted by the fda because of manufacturing problems—the two situations together would lead to losses of about  million in sales unlike other pharmaceutical and healthcare product companies abbott had yet to pursue any large mergers to either expand its product line or ease pricing pressures white quickly took action to address abbotts research problems indicating that he would double rd funding for pharmaceuticals within the first three years of his tenure to bring discipline to the previously fragmented research program white restructured abbotts management team to coordinate research at the companywide level and recruited the wellknown scientist jeffrey leiden to head the pharmaceuticals group whites high expectations for results shaped his decision to cut back in fields of drug development that were less promising for abbott including cardiology urology and renal disease most controversially white halted the majority of abbotts basic research on hiv—beyond the one protease inhibitor already in the pipeline—an area in which he thought the company could not successfully compete he remarked i think if we are going to spend  billion on research and development i should expect scientists who think they are exceptional to do better than come up with a metoo product klein january   in order to quiet talk of a looming takeover and further fill abbotts weak drug pipeline white pursued an aggressive acquisitions strategy completing over  acquisitions licensing agreements and marketing arrangements in the early years of his tenure the deals included an option to buy  percent of supergen a developer of cancer drugs and a  million payment to neurosearch as for the right to develop its drugs for nervoussystem disorders not all of whites acquisitions went so smoothly however in june  he sought to acquire alza corporation a company with several drugdelivery technologies for  billion the deal collapsed due to antitrust concerns and a drop in abbotts share price in the wake of fda sanctions the failed alza acquisition along with continuing regulatory problems at abbotts manufacturing facility raised concerns about whites leadership although praised for bringing vitality and initiative to the historically conservative abbott culture analysts noted whites rough start and questioned his ability to effectively change the companys direction in a highly competitive environment white and abbott turn a corner although doubts lingered about whites leadership abbotts stock rebounded by  rising to  a share from a low of  company earnings rose as well hence despite the collapse of the alza deal white was in a position to continue aggressively pursuing acquisitions in  he successfully engineered a nearly  billion agreement with basf to buy its knoll pharmaceuticals division with the purchase of knoll abbott became the ninthlargest pharamceutical company in the world up from its prior rank of th although the deal dramatically increased abbotts debt while adding only  million to its operating income knoll brought an interesting drug pipeline that included humira a notyet launched therapy for treating rheumatoid arthritis as appealing as drugs like humira were white had also sought knoll out in order to provide abbott with a global infrastructure and expanded rd capacity including a new manufacturing facility in massachusetts after the acquisition white and his management team were under pressure to quickly integrate the two firms in order to move humira quickly to market as described in pharmaceutical executive analysts credited white and other abbott executives with facilitating a smooth transition through their careful handson approach and commitment to preserving and empowering personnel december  humira was successfully launched in early  with sales projected to reach  million in  along with acquiring other firms white strongly emphasized the importance of attracting and retaining the best scientific talent he improved working conditions at his company by increasing vacation time and adding childcare services as was consistent with his own informal style white ordered the construction of volleyball and soccer fields at abbott headquarters to create a workforce that better reflected the companys stakeholders white oversaw a number of diversity initiatives increasing the number of minority personnel in management positions by  percent in five years and fostering leadership opportunities for women abbott was named to fortune s list of the  best companies for minorities every year since the list was conceived in  the firm was also placed among the top  on working mother s list of the best companies for working mothers after several years of acquisitions and a ramping up of research operations in  white announced that no new major purchases lay in abbotts immediate future still white began the year with the  billion acquisition of therasense the maker of diabetic testing tools moving abbott from the numberfive to the numberthree position in the bloodglucose monitoring market in lieu of looking for more external opportunities white then focused on consolidating abbotts operations to concentrate resources on core areas of strength—a strategy which entailed spinning off the  billion hospitalproducts division hospira after years of struggling to meet regulatory standards abbott was informed by the fda in  that its manufacturing facility was largely in compliance with industry regulations allowing the company to move forward with its medicaldiagnostics division although analysts remained uncertain about the longterm effects of whites strategies several agreed that abbott was strong enough to no longer be considered a serious takeover target and that whites aggressive and creative leadership had made a substantially beneficial impact on the company see also entry on abbott laboratories in international
