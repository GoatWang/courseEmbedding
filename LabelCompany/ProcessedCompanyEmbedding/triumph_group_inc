standard corporation a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields including office supplies by the latter half of the decade officers of alco standard corporation were concentrating on office supplies paper products and food services their three core competencies the former was the fastest growing market for the company in  alco was considering selling triumph group and its distribution businesses the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under  of alco standards revenue sedit in addition to its aerospace factions triumph also had a stake in the us steel industry because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality alco standard formed a new organization named alco diversified services out of the  companies that comprised the triumph group the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary richard ill who led triumph group for several years was promoted to president of alco diversified services in  alco sold their food division in  the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell alco diversified services and purchase  percent of imm office systems holding in  triumph group took over alco diversified services in a leveraged buyout triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul industrial machining paper converting and steel converting the companies employed  people at  us locations with aviation accounting for just over  of total sales in  due to department of defense cutbacks triumph sold otto konigslow manufacturing company which manufactured aerospace components to two of its supervisors in the middle of the s commercial aviation sales went from  million to  million in three years with forecasts indicating that sales would reach  million before the end of the decade the aviation businesses provided  of the companys revenue with neverbeforeseen demand for airline travel around  boeing produced close to  aircraft per annum to meet this unprecedented production rate boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services in  the corporation had  workers and yearly earnings of  million six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials the company went public at that time which provided over  million in revenue the company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by  per annum and extend their product lines such acquisitions included air lab  teleflex controls  hydromill company  dv industries  dg industries  chase aerospace limited  and hartford tool and die  the company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviationfocused strategy such as quality park products  and air lab  in  when ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at boeing company he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new boeing  this was an excellent fit for triumph air repair as much of their work consisted of servicing the boeing  and  aircraft it was at this time that boeing company purchased mcdonnell douglas the first company to manufacture the kc aircraft which was the aerial refueling version of the boeing dc soon to follow would be triumph air repairs largest contract ever a twelvemonth deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the united states air force kc tankers boeing had several options to renew increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold in  triumph acquired four additional companies bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early  it was at this time that triumph purchased ralee engineering a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies this gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft in  triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries the company produced flight control surfaces control systems and metal parts while providing mro for almost every aircraft system except cabins communications devices landing gear engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks sedit in  the boeing companys failing spokane washington facility was acquired which is now known as triumph composite systems the conglomerate now stood at  companies in the same quarter of that year the company restructured by discontinuing its metals group and combining its five aviation segments into three the control systems and structures groups were combined into triumph aerospace systems group the gas turbine services and operational components groups were unified becoming triumph components group triumph aftermarket services group added advanced materials technologies and aerospace technologies to its portfolio shortly thereafter triumph acquired the parker hannifin corporation united aircraft products division and rollsroyce gear systems the company then reorganized into two groups triumph aftermarket services and triumph aerospace systems it also combined several of its arizona subsidiaries into triumph engineered solutions which was decommissioned at the end of  in  triumph group purchased mexmil company kongsberg automotive merritt tool company and saygrove defense  aerospace group sedit in june

historyedit sedit triumph group was formerly one of the companies in alco standard corporation a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields including office supplies by the latter half of the decade officers of alco standard corporation were concentrating on office supplies paper products and food services their three core competencies the former was the fastest growing market for the company in  alco was considering selling triumph group and its distribution businesses the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under  of alco standards revenue sedit in addition to its aerospace factions triumph also had a stake in the us steel industry because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality alco standard formed a new organization named alco diversified services out of the  companies that comprised the triumph group the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary richard ill who led triumph group for several years was promoted to president of alco diversified services in  alco sold their food division in  the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell alco diversified services and purchase  percent of imm office systems holding in  triumph group took over alco diversified services in a leveraged buyout triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul industrial machining paper converting and steel converting the companies employed  people at  us locations with aviation accounting for just over  of total sales in  due to department of defense cutbacks triumph sold otto konigslow manufacturing company which manufactured aerospace components to two of its supervisors in the middle of the s commercial aviation sales went from  million to  million in three years with forecasts indicating that sales would reach  million before the end of the decade the aviation businesses provided  of the companys revenue with neverbeforeseen demand for airline travel around  boeing produced close to  aircraft per annum to meet this unprecedented production rate boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services in  the corporation had  workers and yearly earnings of  million six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials the company went public at that time which provided over  million in revenue the company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by  per annum and extend their product lines such acquisitions included air lab  teleflex controls  hydromill company  dv industries  dg industries  chase aerospace limited  and hartford tool and die  the company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviationfocused strategy such as quality park products  and air lab  in  when ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at boeing company he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new boeing  this was an excellent fit for triumph air repair as much of their work consisted of servicing the boeing  and  aircraft it was at this time that boeing company purchased mcdonnell douglas the first company to manufacture the kc aircraft which was the aerial refueling version of the boeing dc soon to follow would be triumph air repairs largest contract ever a twelvemonth deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the united states air force kc tankers boeing had several options to renew increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold in  triumph acquired four additional companies bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early  it was at this time that triumph purchased ralee engineering a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies this gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft in  triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries the company produced flight control surfaces control systems and metal parts while providing mro for almost every aircraft system except cabins communications devices landing gear engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks sedit in  the boeing companys failing spokane washington facility was acquired which is now known as triumph composite systems the conglomerate now stood at  companies in the same quarter of that year the company restructured by discontinuing its metals group and combining its five aviation segments into three the control systems and structures groups were combined into triumph aerospace systems group the gas turbine services and operational components groups were unified becoming triumph components group triumph aftermarket services group added advanced materials technologies and aerospace technologies to its portfolio shortly thereafter triumph acquired the parker hannifin corporation united aircraft products division and rollsroyce gear systems the company then reorganized into two groups triumph aftermarket services and triumph aerospace systems it also combined several of its arizona subsidiaries into triumph engineered solutions which was decommissioned at the end of  in  triumph group purchased mexmil company kongsberg automotive merritt tool company and saygrove defense  aerospace group sedit in june  triumph group acquired vought aircraft industries a leading producer of aerostructures from the carlyle group this acquisition close to doubled the company workforce and created a tier one capable supplier in january  the company sold its division lee aerospace back to the its original founder jim lee triumph had owned lee aerospace for  years in december  triumph group inc announced that daniel j crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective  january  crowley succeeds richard c ill ceo from  ill left

that operated across a large number of unrelated fields including office supplies by the latter half of the decade officers of alco standard corporation were concentrating on office supplies paper products and food services their three core competencies the former was the fastest growing market for the company in  alco was considering selling triumph group and its distribution businesses the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under  of alco standards revenue sedit in addition to its aerospace factions triumph also had a stake in the us steel industry because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality alco standard formed a new organization named alco diversified services out of the  companies that comprised the triumph group the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary richard ill who led triumph group for several years was promoted to president of alco diversified services in  alco sold their food division in  the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell alco diversified services and purchase  percent of imm office systems holding in  triumph group took over alco diversified services in a leveraged buyout triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul industrial machining paper converting and steel converting the companies employed  people at  us locations with aviation accounting for just over  of total sales in  due to department of defense cutbacks triumph sold otto konigslow manufacturing company which manufactured aerospace components to two of its supervisors in the middle of the s commercial aviation sales went from  million to  million in three years with forecasts indicating that sales would reach  million before the end of the decade the aviation businesses provided  of the companys revenue with neverbeforeseen demand for airline travel around  boeing produced close to  aircraft per annum to meet this unprecedented production rate boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services in  the corporation had  workers and yearly earnings of  million six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials the company went public at that time which provided over  million in revenue the company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by  per annum and extend their product lines such acquisitions included air lab  teleflex controls  hydromill company  dv industries  dg industries  chase aerospace limited  and hartford tool and die  the company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviationfocused strategy such as quality park products  and air lab  in  when ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at boeing company he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new boeing  this was an excellent fit for triumph air repair as much of their work consisted of servicing the boeing  and  aircraft it was at this time that boeing company purchased mcdonnell douglas the first company to manufacture the kc aircraft which was the aerial refueling version of the boeing dc soon to follow would be triumph air repairs largest contract ever a twelvemonth deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the united states air force kc tankers boeing had several options to renew increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold in  triumph acquired four additional companies bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early  it was at this time that triumph purchased ralee engineering a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies this gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft in  triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries the company produced flight control surfaces control systems and metal parts while providing mro for almost every aircraft system except cabins communications devices landing gear engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks sedit in  the boeing companys failing spokane washington facility was acquired which is now known as triumph composite systems the conglomerate now stood at  companies in the same quarter of that year the company restructured by discontinuing its metals group and combining its five aviation segments into three the control systems and structures groups were combined into triumph aerospace systems group the gas turbine services and operational components groups were unified becoming triumph components group triumph aftermarket services group added advanced materials technologies and aerospace technologies to its portfolio shortly thereafter triumph acquired the parker hannifin corporation united aircraft products division and rollsroyce gear systems the company then reorganized into two groups triumph aftermarket services and triumph aerospace systems it also combined several of its arizona subsidiaries into triumph engineered solutions which was decommissioned at the end of  in  triumph group purchased mexmil company kongsberg automotive merritt tool company and saygrove defense  aerospace group sedit in june  triumph group acquired vought aircraft industries a leading producer of aerostructures from the carlyle group this acquisition close to doubled the company workforce and created a tier one capable supplier in january  the company sold its division lee aerospace back to the its original founder
