kühlwhile kühl is known today for great fitting pants and wool sweaters the origins of the kühl story can be traced back to the snowy wasatch mountains of  with a peruvianinspired polar fleece cap known as the “alf hat” the hat was the brainchild of john “alf” engwall who partnered with a young conrad anker and brothers jay and kevin boyle to market the “alf” to serious skiers and mountaineers driven to build a business around the mountain lifestyle they loved as well as to fund the obsession with climbing and skiing that they all shared they founded a company called alfwear the alf hat became the goto choice of avid powder skiers in the ‘s and the fledgling company enjoyed a relative amount of success then tragedy struck when a car accident took the life of john engwall the three remaining partners continued to run the business for several more years until in  following the loss of several key accounts the original alfwear partnership was dissolved conrad anker went on to pursue his legendary career as a professional mountaineer and jay boyle began to attend graduate school what remained of the company several boxes of the original alf hat was left to kevin boyle who went to work transforming the brand drawing on his passion for skiing art and mountain life kevin envisioned a new line of clothing and in  he turned alfwear into the company we know today as kühl the first product kühl introduced was the jacquard jacket a fleece top featuring thumbloop cuffs a first in outdoor clothing and underarm gussets for freedom of movement the jacket rapidly became popular in the outdoor community and even won the polartec apex award for design excellence as the company began to build on the success of the jacquard jacket careful attention was paid to ensure that the skiing and climbing lifestyle lived by the founders would continue to inspire and guide the brand—an initiative that is maintained to this day design work continued and the line expanded to include pants shirts shorts and hats for both men and women today the kühl line of clothing features unique weaves carefully selected fabrics vintage washes and renowned attention to fit—especially with their pants you’d be hard pressed to find a genuine disciple of mountain culture who doesn’t have a pair of kühl pants in their weekly rotation evidence of the likeminded designers who bring each kühl garment into existence for great fit freedom of movement and a sense of style that is truly “born in the mountains” look no further than kühl mens clothing on sale  backcountrycomforgotsign insigning

ventilating strategically placed hightech knit mesh panels and kühl’s exclusive articulated panel sleeves patent pending deliver ultimate range of motion for outdoor pursuits about kühlwhile kühl is known today for great fitting pants and wool sweaters the origins of the kühl story can be traced back to the snowy wasatch mountains of  with a peruvianinspired polar fleece cap known as the “alf hat” the hat was the brainchild of john “alf” engwall who partnered with a young conrad anker and brothers jay and kevin boyle to market the “alf” to serious skiers and mountaineers driven to build a business around the mountain lifestyle they loved as well as to fund the obsession with climbing and skiing that they all shared they founded a company called alfwear the alf hat became the goto choice of avid powder skiers in the ‘s and the fledgling company enjoyed a relative amount of success then tragedy struck when a car accident took the life of john engwall the three remaining partners continued to run the business for several more years until in  following the loss of several key accounts the original alfwear partnership was dissolved conrad anker went on to pursue his legendary career as a professional mountaineer and jay boyle began to attend graduate school what remained of the company several boxes of the original alf hat was left to kevin boyle who went to work transforming the brand drawing on his passion for skiing art and mountain life kevin envisioned a new line of clothing and in  he turned alfwear into the company we know today as kühl the first product kühl introduced was the jacquard jacket a fleece top featuring thumbloop cuffs a first in outdoor clothing and underarm gussets for freedom of movement the jacket rapidly became popular in the outdoor community and even won the polartec apex award for design excellence as the company began to build on the success of the jacquard jacket careful attention was paid to ensure that the skiing and climbing lifestyle lived by the founders would continue to inspire and guide the brand—an initiative that is maintained to this day design work continued and the line expanded to include pants shirts shorts and hats for both men and women today the kühl line of clothing features unique weaves carefully selected fabrics vintage washes and renowned attention to fit—especially with their pants you’d be hard pressed to find a genuine disciple of mountain culture who doesn’t have a pair of kühl pants in their weekly rotation evidence of the likeminded designers who bring each kühl garment into existence for great fit freedom of movement and a sense of style that is truly “born in the mountains” look no further than kühl mens clothing on sale  backcountrycomforgotsign insigning in
