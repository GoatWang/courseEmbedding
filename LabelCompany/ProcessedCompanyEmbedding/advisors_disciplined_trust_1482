life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business this wisdom brings financial rewards sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same longrange vision yet when it comes to investing in the market seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons unknowingly their investments are commingled with approximately  of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear this herd mentality drives
