responsible fund insight outlook newsletters multiscenario contact insight outlook newsletters multiscenario q  q  q  q  investment outlook q  market commentary given the slow but steady improvement in economic conditions for many world economies in the first half of  second quarter results were still surprising in a number of ways in late june both the us and european central banks announced they would not be as easy in managing the supply and outlook for the worlds currencies in addition a number of incidents and political statements in some of the largest countries particularly in france the uk and the us shook up the expectation s for an improvement in the economies as well as the political practices of many of the governments in spite of these jolts financial markets continued their improvement in the second quarter the now clichéd trump bump in the us — which was based on the presumption of a resurgence of animal spirits and a major improvement in economic policies proposed by the new republican administration — morphed into the trump slump as it has become apparent that neither new tax policies nor the speed of their adoption is going to be as easy and timely as expected the outlook for the domestic economy was downgraded due to the uncertainty regarding these beneficial changes and it is believed that the us gdp growth will have a difficult time accelerating from the  rate we have been stuck in for the past seven years interest rates retraced much of the postelection rise and incipient price inflation pressures faded as a result sectors in the market with commodityprice exposure or cyclical sensitivity reacted negatively in the quarter yet the trump slump appeared to have run its course by the end of may and in june largecap value benchmark returns improved relative to largecap growth as some of the most popular most richlyvalued growth technology stocks saw shortlived but sharp periods of price decline interestsensitive stocks like utilities also weakened whereas economicallysensitive stocks strengthened again at this point in the year the federal reserve boards policy seems clear — expect another rate hike later in  it is also clear that the fed is determined to adhere to its change in money supplydollar stance as reflected in its discussion of the timing of the planned reduction in the banks balance sheet rather than continuing to focus on micro managing fed policy with its large holdings of securities the greatest surprise for us and european bond markets was the statement by the ecbs mario draghi that the risk of deflation in europe was considerably reduced bond prices sold off and yields rose dramatically as investors understood that the long period of extraordinary monetary ease in europe might be coming to an end overall the stock markets current valuation no longer looks inexpensive particularly among the highgrowth tech companies and many perceived safe havens investors are in a show me mood which indicates it will take more than hope to drive the market significantly higher corporate decisions not to invest in new plant and equipment are a negative for more robust domestic economic outlook therefore it looks like real positive change on regulation and tax policy in other words fiscal policy will be needed to create more confidence in the economy for the balance of the year amid all of this noise the wide swings in stock markets around the world widened valuation spreads among sectors our emphasis on the quality of companies selling at reasonable prices seems appropriate to continue to meet our clients needs the consensus seems to be torn between hoping for strengthening in the us without triggering a round of higher inflation this would be reason for optimism for investors if the politicalsocial issues facing many economies dont reemerge it would be nice if both wall street and main street here in the us could be celebrating as the year progresses the analysis and opinion
