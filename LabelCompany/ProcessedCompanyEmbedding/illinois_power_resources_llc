forest il charles r schmadeke  j william roberts  hinshaw  culbertson springfield il for defendants opinion  order joe billy mcdade united states senior district judge this matter is currently before the court on plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment doc  and defendants motion for summary judgment doc  each motion is fully briefed and the court held oral argument on july   so the motions are ready for decision for the reasons explained below each motion is granted in part and denied in part background in this case three notforprofit environmental organizations — natural resources defense council respiratory health association and sierra club inc — have sued illinois power resources generating llc iprg which is the owner and operator of the ed edwards power plant edwards and iprgs parentcompany illinois power resources llc ipr on behalf of themselves and their members plaintiffs have alleged that edwards was out of compliance with certain clean air act emissions standards on thousands of occasions between  and  they have brought the lawsuit pursuant to the clean air acts citizen suit provision  usc §  which allows any person to commence a civil suit against among others persons alleged to be in violation of an emission standard or limitation edwards is a threeunit coalfired power plant located in bartonville illinois two of its units — units  and  — exhaust through a common smokestack the third exhausts through a second smokestack the center of which is less than  feet from the center of the common stack these units are subject to a variety of emission requirements that are designed to ensure compliance with ambient air quality standards established by the united states environmental protection agency us epa pursuant to the clean air act see  usc §§  edwards emission requirements at issue in this case derive from two sources  the illinois state implementation plan sip which is a set of regulations intended to implement the ambient air quality standards and  an operating permit permit issued by the illinois epa on june   both the permit and the sip limit the amount of particulate matter that edwards can emit while it is operating see  ill admin code §§   limiting particulate matter emissions from certain power plants that existed prior to april   permit condition  doc  at  they also subject to certain exceptions that are discussed more fully below limit the opacity of the plume emanating from edwards two smokestacks see  ill admin code §  limiting opacity for certain power plants that existed prior to april   to thirty percent permit condition  doc  at  because there is a correlation between opacity and particulate matter emission levels regulators use the degree of opacity as a proxy for the amount of particulate matter that a plant emits the permit and the sip require that edwards continuously monitor its opacity to ensure compliance with the thirtypercent limit and also make quarterly reports to the illinois epa that provide information about periods of excess opacity see  ill admin code §§   permit condition  doc  at  these reports shall be based on six minute averages of opacity and must contain the percent opacity for each continuous opacity excess period and the start and stop time in six minute increments of any opacity measurements in excess of the limitation  ill admin code § c the quarterly reports must also identify the cause of the excess emissions if known see permit condition aid doc  at   ill admin code § a to comply with permit condition aid edwards includes in its reports reason codes for opacity exceedances including codes such as excess emission — startupshutdown  — excess emission — control equipment problems  — excess emission — process problems and  — excess emission — other known causes between april   and june   edwards reported to the illinois epa  instances in which it had an average opacity of greater than thirty percent for six minutes or longer plaintiffs seek partial summary judgment on their first three claims based on these reports in count one plaintiffs have alleged that edwards violated the opacity standards on those reported occasions in which it was not in a state of startup malfunction or breakdown in count two plaintiffs have alleged that edwards violated the opacity standards on those reported occasions in which it may have been in a state of startup malfunction or breakdown and in count three plaintiffs have alleged that edwards violated its particulate matter standards they rely upon the opacity exceedances established in the first two claims in order to establish a derivative violation of the particulate matter standards see  ill admin code § da explaining that for certain power plants opacity exceedances may also be deemed particulate matter exceedances on the merits defendants primarily rely upon two regulatory defenses first they argue that edwards was in compliance with its particulate matter limits at all times including when it was out of compliance with its opacity limits if correct this would provide a complete defense to plaintiffs first second and third claims second they argue that a great number of the opacity exceedances should be excused because they occurred during periods of malfunction or breakdown plaintiffs concede that defendants may be able to prove a defense in some instances so they have excluded certain exceedances from their motion these include  each exceedance identified in the quarterly reports as being associated with a startup  eight exceedances in which edwards submitted to the illinois epa a malfunction report indicating that opacity exceedances occurred during a malfunction or breakdown and  with respect to only the third claim for relief each exceedance that occurred within sixty days prior to a particulate matter stack test conducted by defendants for the remaining exceedances however plaintiffs argue that the defenses fail as a matter of law legal standard summary judgment shall be granted where the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law fed r civ p a in ruling on a motion for summary judgment the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party sms demag aktiengesellschaft v material scis corp  fd   th cir all inferences drawn from the facts must be construed in favor of the nonmovant moore v vital prods inc  fd   th cir to survive summary judgment the nonmovant must show through specific evidence that a triable issue of fact remains on issues on which it bears the burden of proof at trial warsco v preferred technical grp  fd   th cir citing celotex corp v catrett  us    sct   ledd   if the evidence on record could not lead a reasonable jury to find for the nonmovant then no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law see mcclendon v ind sugars inc  fd   th cir at the summary judgment stage the court may not resolve issues of fact disputed material facts must be left for resolution at trial anderson v liberty lobby inc  us    sct   ledd   crossmotions for

plaintiffs rely upon the following evidence to establish standing nrdc has provided declarations and deposition testimony from members linda andrews robert jorgensen and mary ann schafer sierra club has provided a declaration and deposition testimony from member david pittman and rha has provided declarations and deposition testimony from alicia high and tracy meints fox defendants have provided the deposition testimony of most standing witnesses in an effort to undermine their credibility the evidence is summarized below  nrdc witnesses linda andrews lives less than  miles from edwards and describes herself as very outdoororiented doc  at  she explains that she regularly runs marathons and half marathons and runs outside as much as possible throughout the year id she avers that air pollution from edwards can impair her ability to do the activities she enjoys she does much of her training  miles to the north of her home because she believes her strenuous activities are safer and knows they are certainly more enjoyable in the country where the air is cleaner id at  she avers that she wishes she could run closer to home but that she avoids doing so in view of her health concerns and the unpleasantness of running in dirty air id she also avers that she is concerned about the impact of poor air quality on her husbands health as he has emphysema id during her deposition andrews described the smoke that she saw coming out of edwards as ugly and explained that she has an issue with particulate matter being released above and beyond the regulations repeatedly doc  at  her knowledge of edwards emissions effects on air quality is limited to the allegations that were pleaded in the complaint mary ann schafer lives in near edwards in peoria and avers that she is very concerned with edwards impact on air quality around her because she suffers from asthma and loves fresh air doc  at  she explained that she used to open her house up when the weather was good but does not do so anymore because of her concerns about air quality id at  she is also concerned about the impact that pollution from edwards will have on her grandchildren id during her deposition she expressed concern over particulate matter in the air — which she defined as tiny things that are in the solid state and cause problems for people with asthma like myself — and said she has grown more concerned about particulate matter as her asthma has gotten worse she did explain though that particulate matter is caused by many sources and said that it is the worst during leaf burning season doc  at   robert jorgenson lives in east peoria illinois and has concerns about the impact of poor air quality on his health edwards is a short distance from where he lives and he also goes to bartonville five or six times a year because his daughter works there doc  at  he is especially concerned about breathing particulate matter because he has a history of significant cardiac problems id at  he is aware of the impact that particulate matter has on cardiovascular health and he also is aware that edwards exceeds its particulate matter limits id at  jorgenson regularly goes outside either to ride his bike walk or do house work id during his deposition testimony jorgenson said he would be concerned about edwards even if it operated within its particulate matter limit and identified other particulate matter concerns such as the fact that he lives close to a highway  sierra club witness sierra club is basing its standing on only one member david pittman pittman lives in west peoria illinois and his house is less than eight miles downwind of edwards doc  at  he is concerned about the health impacts that particulate matter from edwards will have on his wife who suffers from a variety of cardiovascular health issues id at  he also spends a large amount of time outdoors and edwards particulate matter diminishes his enjoyment during that time id during his deposition pittman said that he is most concerned with sulfurdioxide emissions at edwards and he also identified other sources of particulate matter that concern him such as trash burning and wood smoke doc  at  but he affirmed that he is also concerned with particulate matter emissions from edwards id at   rha witnesses rha is basing its standing on the declarations of two individuals each of whom claims to be an rha member tracy meints fox lives in chillicothe illinois approximately  miles north of the plant doc  at  alicia high lived in bloomington illinois approximately  miles from edwards when the lawsuit was filed but she lives in texas now the parties dispute whether high and fox should be considered members of rha article vi of rhas  bylaws defined how individuals become members of the rha at the time this lawsuit was filed it provides that any person who concurs with the purposes of the association and who makes an active contribution to the work of the association may become a general member upon election by the board or executive committee and the payment of an annual membership fee to be determined by the board doc  at  there is no evidence in the record that high or fox were elected by the board or executive committee nor is there evidence that they paid an annual membership fee because rha cannot show membership that complies with the bylaws defendants argue that it lacks standing there is however evidence that fox made donations to rha in  and  that high participated in rha events beginning in  for which she personally paid  and that both high and fox approve of the organizations purpose rha argues that this evidence of membership is enough especially in light of an undated resolution passed by the rha board that provides it is hereby further resolved that alicia high and tracy fox could properly consider themselves members of the association because they have made contributions of money to the association and have demonstrated through their actions in a peoria area power plant litigation matter that they concur with the purpose of the association and have made an active contribution to the work of the association doc  the resolution explains that the  bylaw was not intended to require the board or executive committee to expressly elect each person to membership or to require a contribution of a particular size to the association id instead the resolution explains that it was appropriate to treat any person who concurred with the purposes of the association and who made a financial contribution as a member as that term is used in the bylaws id this dispute raises a number of thorny legal questions first should the court secondguess rhas interpretation of its bylaws when a reasonable juror could conclude that rha adopted a convenient litigation position to allow it to establish standing after the lawsuit was filed see dannhausen v bus publns audit of circulation inc  fd   th cir  illinois law does not permit courts to adjudicate the merits of private associations decisions but see friends of the earth inc v laidlaw envtl servs inc  us    sct   ledd   explaining that standing should be measured at the outset of litigation pollack v us dept of justice  fd   n  th cir a plaintiff must establish standing at the time suit is filed and cannot manufacture standing afterwards second if a person has failed to comply with bylaws that govern membership but demonstrates certain other indicia of membership should a court consider that person to be a member of the organization for standing purposes compare citizens coal council v canestrale contracting inc  fsuppd   wdpa with california sportfishing prot alliance v diablo grande inc  fsuppd   edcal ultimately it is unnecessary to resolve this dispute because as discussed below both nrdc and sierra club have standing and that is all that is required for plaintiffs to proceed with this lawsuit see bond  fd at  b nrdc and sierra clubs undisputed evidence is sufficient to confer standing defendants have challenged the sufficiency of nrdc and sierra clubs standing witnesses affidavits to establish standing for the organizations they argue that each of the

windows closed to keep the outside air out and reduce her exposure to particulate matter robert jorgenson the third nrdc witness regularly goes outside to hike bike and do yard work and is concerned about his cardiovascular health when he does so david pittman of the sierra club spends a large amount of time outdoors and is concerned about the impact on his health that exposure to particulate matter has during that time he is also concerned about his wifes cardiovascular health these standing witnesses — other than linda andrews and mary ann schaeffer — do not claim that they changed their behavior because of their concerns it could therefore be argued that they did not suffer the sort of recreational harms that laidlaw held give rise to standing see  us at   sct  however the standing witnesses need not show that they abandoned recreational activities because of pollution they just need to show that their pleasure was diminished because of the pollution see am bottom conservancy

cognizable injury so long as it is reasonable see id franklin cnty  fd at  texans united  fd at  defendants argue that the standing witnesses fears are unreasonable they have provided expert testimony from lucy fraiser who opines that the emissions at issue cannot cause the health consequences that concern the standing witnesses specifically fraiser opines that edwards did not cause shortterm or longterm atmospheric pm concentrations sufficient to cause or contribute to injury of human life or health and thus the magnitude of the potential exposures do not support the fears alleged doc  at  she further opines that edwards did not cause shortterm or longterm atmospheric pm concentrations sufficient to cause visibility impairment or other welfare impacts and the emissions were not of a characteristic frequency or duration that presents a reasonable likelihood of future harm id she therefore concludes that the standing witnesses fears are not supported by reliable medical or scientific evidence id at  defendants have set the bar for reasonableness too high a fear need not be based on medical or scientific evidence of probable consequences in order to be reasonable rather a fear cannot be so irrational that it can simply be discredited franklin cnty  fd at  the relevant question is not whether pollutants are present in such a high concentration that they will assuredly cause health problems rather it is whether pollutants that can be attributed to defendant could cause harm and are present in the geographic area in which the standing witness has an interest see pollack  fd  am canoe assn  fd  and gaston copper  fd  th cir in pollack a resident of highland park illinois alleged that he was harmed by the discharge of lead bullets from a firing range into lake michigan among other things the plaintiff based his claim for standing on the fact that he drinks water drawn from lake michigan for highland park  fd at  the court concluded that his intention to drink water and his fear that his water has been contaminated by lead from bullets does not give rise to standing id it explained that his fear was unreasonable because it was unclear from the record whether any pollution from bullets discharged into lake michigan would travel the thirteen miles from where they were discharged to where the plaintiffs drinking water was drawn id the court suggested however that the outcome would have been different had pollack actually used the areas affected by pollution id indeed in a concurring opinion judge cudahy noted that the plaintiff had only pointed to a small amount of lead in his drinking water but concluded that it would have been sufficient to establish injuryinfact if the plaintiff had provided competent evidence that the lead was from the firing range id at  cudahy j concurring in american canoe a standing witness asserted that he was harmed by the illegal discharge of hog waste because he used a stream fourmiles downstream from the discharge site for swimming drinking and fishing  fd at  he asserted that his fear of pollution has kept him from swimming in bathing in or drinking the water from the creek id at  he based his fear of pollution on expert testimony that the pollutants in the swine waste may have severe adverse environmental and human health effects and that the pollutants traveled downstream id without discussing whether the concentration of pollutants in the creek was sufficient to cause those health effects the court concluded that the standing witnesss fear was reasonable because he used an area subject to contamination from the discharge id at  indeed the court suggested that the contamination itself was relatively insignificant as it noted the minimal number of discharges at issue id finally in gaston copper a homeowner who lived downstream from a smelting factory plainly demonstrated injury in fact by testifying that he and his family swim less in and eat less fish from his lake because his fears of pollution from the factorys permit exceedances  fd at  he was anything but a roving environmental ombudsman seeking to right environmental wrongs because he was a real person who owns a real home and lake in close proximity to the defendant id at  the court explained that there was ample evidence that his fears are reasonable and not based on mere conjecture because the record is replete with evidence that gaston copper is fouling its receiving waters id indeed there were over  violations of the companys discharge limits including unlawful releases of cadmium copper iron lead and zinc as well as ph violations and also epa studies and expert testimony of the adverse health and environmental effects of these chemicals id as in both american canoe and pollack in gaston the courts injuryinfact analysis focused on the presence of pollutants that are known to cause harm to human health in an area in which the standing witness has an interest here there is no dispute that particulate matter of the type emitted by edwards can be harmful as discussed in greater detail below the record establishes that edwards regularly exceeded its particulate matter limitations during the relevant time period see infra at  and at oral argument the parties conceded that each of the standing witnesses for nrdc and sierra club live work or recreate in a geographic area where edwards particulate matter emissions were and are present in light of this the standing witnesses concerns were reasonable see pollack  fd at  am canoe assn  fd at  gaston copper  fd at  see also laidlaw  us at   sct  explaining that fears of pollution are reasonable when there is evidence of continuous and pervasive illegal discharges of pollutants into a river defendants argue that this sort of injury is at best a possible future injury that is insufficient to establish standing doc  at  to support this argument they rely upon clapper v amnesty intl usa  us   sct   ledd   in clapper a variety of attorneys and human rights labor legal and media organizations sought declaratory and injunctive relief from a provision of the foreign intelligence surveillance act that they argued was unconstitutional the plaintiffs primarily based their standing on the objectively reasonable likelihood that their communications with targets of the fisa law will be acquired  at some point in the future id at  the supreme court held that the plaintiffs did not suffer an injury in fact that conferred standing it explained that the threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact and rejected the plaintiffs injury as a highly speculative fear that their communications would be intercepted by government agents who relied upon the challenged statute for authority id at  here the standing witnesses have stipulated that they did not suffer any health harms because of edwards emissions doc  and defendants argue that all fear of future harm is too speculative defendants however seek to extend the holding of clapper too far the line of cases beginning with laidlaw remains good law and was unchanged by clapper in fact the supreme court expressly distinguished clapper from laidlaw it explained that in laidlaw the standing was based upon harm caused by unlawful discharges of pollutants that were concededly ongoing whereas it was dealing with a challenge to a law in which there was no evidence of ongoing surveillance  sct at  it was the ongoing discharge of pollution in laidlaw and the pollutions impact on recreational and aesthetic interests that created actual and not speculative injury id for the above reasons the court finds that the undisputed material facts establish that nrdc and sierra clubs members have shown injury in fact  traceability in addition to showing injury in fact plaintiffs must show a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of lujan  us at   sct  in other words the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court id defendants next argue that any injuries suffered by the standing witnesses cannot be traced to the challenged activities they argue that plaintiffs cannot show that there is a substantial likelihood that edwards caused plaintiffs harm because there is no evidence that edwards exceeded the particulate matter violations doc  at  citing pub interest research grp of nj inc v powell duffryn terminals inc  fd   d cir defendants argument fails for two reasons first as explained below plaintiffs have established through derivative opacity violations that edwards did violate its particulate matter limits second the standing witnesses need not even demonstrate such a violation in order to prove standing injuries are not fairly traceable when they are the result of independent action of some third party not before the court texas indep producers  royalty owners assn v epa  fd   th cir where a plaintiff has pointed to a polluting source as the seed of his injury and the owner of the polluting source has supplied no alternative culprit the fairly traceable requirement can be said to be fairly met gaston copper  fd at  franklin cnty  fd at  however where a defendant has pointed to an alternative culprit that is responsible for all of the pollution at issue the injury is not fairly traceable to the defendant see pollack  fd at  cudahy j concurring pollacks limited evidence that lead has traveled or will travel south to highland park and enter the plaintiffs drinking water was outweighed in the view of the district court by the defendants evidence of an alternative cause for lead in the water — the corrosive pipes in this case it is undisputed that there are a variety of sources of particulate matter in the air that the standing witnesses breathe this includes particulate matter from edwards and also includes for example particulate matter from leaf burning and highway traffic when multiple sources contribute to the pollution at issue plaintiffs are not required to show to a scientific certainty that defendants emissions and defendants emissions alone caused the precise harm suffered by the plaintiff see powell duffryn terminals inc  fd at  instead plaintiffs must merely show that a defendant discharges a pollutant that causes or contributes to the kinds of injuries alleged in the specific geographic area of concern gaston copper  fd at  internal quotation marks omitted see also sierra club v cedar point oil co inc  fd   th cir the fact that third parties could also have contributed to the alleged injuries does not mean that the injury is not fairly traceable to a defendants conduct am canoe

plaintiffs must prove that their fairly traceable injuries are redressable a plaintiff need not show that a favorable decision will relieve his every injury mass v epa  us    sct   ledd   rather a plaintiff simply needs to show that a favorable decision will relieve a discrete injury to himself id in this case plaintiffs allege that edwards engaged in opacity and particulate matter violations that began before the lawsuit was filed and continued thereafter they seek declaratory relief injunctive relief and civil penalties this evidence — of past continuing wrongs — is sufficient to establish that plaintiffs injuries are redressable by injunctive relief see gaston copper  fd at  explaining that a plaintiff seeking injunctive relief shows redressability by alleging a continuing violation or the imminence of a future violation of the statute at issue and concluding that postcomplaint violations demonstrate a continuing violation that is redressable by injunctive relief internal quotation marks omitted concerned citizens around murphy  fsuppd at  explaining that past violations together with violations that continued after the filing of the complaint sufficiently establish that unless some action is taken to prevent the illegal conduct there is a real threat that such violations will continue to occur plaintiffs have also established that their injuries are redressable by civil penalties civil penalties do more than promote immediate compliance by limiting the defendants economic incentive to delay its attainment of permit limits — they also deter future violations by encouraging defendants to discontinue ongoing illegal conduct laidlaw  us at   sct  see also sierra club v tennessee valley auth  fd   th cir civil penalties  redress injuries by abating current violations and preventing future ones internal quotation marks omitted therefore civil penalties redress plaintiffs injuries for the same reason that injunctive relief does defendants make one additional argument that must be addressed they argue that plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of future particulate matter violations because the regulatory provision that establishes edwards particulate matter violations would not apply to future violations defendants are correct plaintiffs rely upon  ill admin code § d to prove that edwards violated its particulate matter limits and plaintiffs concede that they could not prove future particulate matter violations in that way however this confuses the issue just because a plaintiff could no longer prove particulate matter violations through § d does not mean that particulate matter limits no longer apply to edwards it simply takes one way to establish the particulate matter violations off the table in this case plaintiffs have alleged that edwards continued to violate particulate matter limits and have as discussed below proven that continuing violation just because the method of proof the plaintiffs have relied upon does not apply to future violations does not negate that proof of past continuing violations or suggest that future violations will not occur as discussed above the undisputed facts show that members of nrdc and the sierra club have suffered an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to edwards emissions and would be redressed by a judgment in favor of plaintiffs as nrdc and sierra club have standing the courts subjectmatter jurisdiction is secure ii the merits with the threshold matter of standing addressed it is now appropriate to address the merits of plaintiffs claims plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment on their first three claims against iprg each of these claims is based on selfreported incidents of excess opacity if iprg cannot produce evidence that would allow it to prove an affirmative defense for these exceedances summary judgment for plaintiffs is appropriate see us v bw inv prop  fd   th cir explaining that the caa is a strict liability statute concerned citizens around murphy  fsuppd at  granting summary judgment based on the defendants selfreports of emission violations defendants have raised three defenses that the court will consider in turn first they argue that they were in compliance with their particulate matter limitations at all times second they argue that many of the exceedances occurred during periods of excusable malfunctions or breakdowns third they argue that the particulate matter limits and opacity limits do not apply during times in which edwards is not operating the first two defenses fail the third succeeds with respect to count three but fails with respect to counts one and two a particulate matter defense one regulatory defense established by the illinois pollution control board ipcb to opacity violations that is available to defendants is the particulate matter defense which is codified at  ill admin code § d this defense provides in relevant part compliance with the particulate regulations of this part shall constitute a defense  for all emission units which are not subject to chapters  or  of the caa and certain particulate matter limits to which edwards is subject but which are subject to opacity limitations the opacity limitations  shall not apply if it is shown that the emission unit was at the time of such emission in compliance with the applicable particulate emissions limitations of subparts d through t of this part  for all emission units which are not subject to chapters  or  of the caa but which are subject to certain particulate matter limits to which edwards is subject a an exceedance of the opacity limitations shall constitute a violation of the applicable particulate limitations it shall be a defense to a violation of the applicable particulate limitations if during a subsequent performance test conducted within a reasonable time not to exceed  days under the same operating conditions for the unit and the control devices and in accordance with method   cfr part  incorporated by reference in section  of this part the owner or operator shows that the emission unit is in compliance with the particulate emission limitations b it shall be a defense to an exceedance of the opacity limit if during a subsequent performance test conducted within a reasonable time not to exceed  days under the same operating conditions of the emission unit and the control devices and in accordance with method   cfr part  appendix a incorporated by reference in section  of this part the owner or operator shows that the emission unit is in compliance with the allowable particulate emissions limitation while simultaneously having visible emissions equal to or greater than the opacity exceedance as originally observed  ill admin code § d defendants rely upon the first sentence of § d to argue that they have a complete defense to both the opacity violations alleged in counts one and two and the particulate matter violations alleged in count three their expert ralph roberson correlated particulate matter emissions from edwards to contemporaneous opacity readings he concluded that there is no evidence to support a claim that the edwards power station either unit  or  which exhaust through a common stack or unit  has exceeded the allowable pm emission limits on the individual units doc  at  roberson reached this conclusion by utilizing stack testing data from edwards but as explained below this method did not comply with the method prescribed under § d plaintiffs however argue that in proving the particulate matter defense edwards is restricted to the method established in § d this would make robersons testimony irrelevant under § d a covered power plant satisfies the particulate matter defense for opacity exceedances by within sixty days of the exceedance conducting a stack test to show that it is within the applicable particulate matter limitations while the unit is both operating under the same conditions and with opacity equal to or greater than the originallyobserved opacity see  ill admin code § db a covered power plant satisfies the particulate matter defense for derivative particulate matter exceedances by within sixty days of the opacity exceedance conducting a stack test that shows it is within the applicable particulate matter limitations while the unit is operating under the same operating conditions as it was during the exceedance id § da the record shows that edwards conducted a stack test on one unit on november   stack tests on all units on july   and stack tests on all units on april   during these tests edwards opacity did not exceed thirty percent plaintiffs argue that these stack tests cannot support a defense for the first two counts and can only arguably provide a defense for the third count for those exceedances that occurred within sixty days of the stack tests as the facts here are not in dispute whether and to what extent defendants can rely upon the particulate matter defense is a question of law that is wellsuited for summary judgment its resolution depends upon resolving two separate issues first whether edwards is even subject to § d and second whether § d provides an exclusive way for edwards to prove the particulate matter defense  section ds application to edwards section d does not apply to emission units that are subject to chapters  and  of the caa although the parties agree that edwards was not subject to section  of the clean air act during the relevant period they dispute whether edwards was subject to section   usc §  for purposes of § d defendant argues that edwards was subject to section  because the us epa listed coalfired electrical generating units like edwards under section c plaintiffs however argue that edwards was not subject to section  because the us epa had not issued any regulations that pertained to edwards during the relevant time period the court must determine what subject to chapter    of the caa means for the purpose of § d courts interpreting a regulation first look to the regulations text and look past it only when it is ambiguous or where a literal interpretation would lead to an absurd result or thwart the purpose of the overall statutory scheme first natl bank of chicago v standard bank  trust  fd   th cir internal quotation marks omitted the text of § d is susceptible to both parties readings so understanding both how section  of the clean air act operates and the regulatory history of § d is necessary to make this determination section  is the codification of the national emissions standards

section  if it found that regulation is appropriate and necessary after considering the results of the study id the appropriate and necessary finding is only the beginning of a regulatory process — a kickoff finding that lists plants like edwards and eventually leads to the promulgation of emissions limits for certain listed pollutants see michigan  sct at  kagan j dissenting following the appropriate and necessary finding coalfired power plants are listed under section c and the us epa must then promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category or subcategory of major sources and area sources of hazardous air pollutants listed for regulation  usc § c d a decision to list a category of sources pursuant to section c is not a final agency action that is subject to immediate judicial review id § e instead judicial review must wait until the us epa has issued regulations pursuant to section d id the us epa completed the study required by section na and in  concluded that the regulation of coaland oilfired power plants is appropriate and necessary environmental protection agency notice of regulatory finding  fed reg   dec   however it did not promulgate any regulations until  and those regulations did not apply to existing coalfired power plants until  see  cfr §  plaintiffs rely upon this statutory structure in arguing that edwards was not subject to section  of the clean air act for purposes of § d although they acknowledge that edwards was listed pursuant to section c they point out that edwards did not need to comply with any regulatory obligations under section  during the relevant period listing under section c does have certain legal consequences however and defendants seize onto them in arguing that edwards was subject to section

following construction reconstruction or modification  usc § g memorandum from robert j meyers to regional administrators jan   doc  at  coal and oilfired egus which were a listed source category

a plants construction reconstruction or modification wildearth guardians  fsuppd at  edwards — which was in operation at the time that coalfired power plants were listed — was not immediately subject to any emission standards under section  instead at the time of listing any obligations that edwards had under section  were necessarily abstract or conditional edwards only became subject to promulgated section  regulations after the relevant time period at issue further under section g edwards would only have needed to meet certain established emission standards if it was modified or reconstructed but it was not thus the structure of section  suggests that edwards was not subject to it even though it was listed a review of regulatory history confirms that a power plant is only subject to section  for purposes of § d if it is subject to standards promulgated pursuant to it see first natl bank  fd at  explaining that the regulatory history of a regulation is relevant in

language to clarify that section d does not apply to sources subject to new source performance standards ie subject to section  or  of the clean air act id it also added language to clarify that section d does not apply to sources subject to new source performance standards id at  this indicates that the ipcb understood the regulatory language at issue to be equivalent to subject to standards issued pursuant to section  or  of the clean air act as with section  section  does not itself establish standards rather it simply establishes the manner through which standards shall be set section  of the clean air act authorizes the us epa to either develop regulations governing new sources new source performance standards regulations or to require states to regulate existing sources see  usc § b d so the ipcbs explanation that § d does not apply to sources subject to regulatoryestablished standards — and its acknowledged shorthand for that sources subject to section  or  of the clean air act suggest that the ipcb does not consider listed sources to be subject to section  of the clean air act unless the listed source is subject to emission standards established through section d or g in light of the foregoing the court concludes that for purposes of § d edwards was not subject to section  of the clean air act during the period of exceedances at issue in this case therefore it was subject to § d  section d provides edwards with its sole method of proving the particulate matter defense the next issue is whether defendants can prove the particulate matter defense in any way other than that provided by § d as shown by the text structure and regulatory history of § d edwards is limited to the method provided in § d to establish the particulate matter defense defendants argue that the first sentence of § d — compliance with the particulate regulations of this part shall constitute a defense — provides a general particulate matter defense that they can prove with any admissible evidence they suggest that subsections da and db provide operators of power plants with a particular method for proving compliance as a safe harbor that aids but does not otherwise restrict the particulate matter defense this argument is contrary to the structure of § d it is a basic tenant that a regulation ought upon the whole to be so construed that if it can be prevented no clause sentence or word shall be superfluous void or insignificant see trw inc v andrews  us    sct   ledd   internal quotation marks omitted defendants reading of the regulation would render § d superfluous section ds two major subsections apply to mutually exclusive sets of emission units section d only applies to a subset of coalfired power plants while § d applies to a broader range of power plants but does not apply to those covered by § d while subsection d describes a particular way of proving compliance with the particulate matter regulations subsection d provides a general particulate matter defense the opacity limitations  shall not apply if it is shown that the emission unit was at the time of such emission in compliance with the applicable particulate emissions limitations as established above edwards is subject to subsection d and therefore cannot be subject to subsection d if edwards could mount a general defense based upon the first sentence of subsection d it would essentially be mounting the same defense established by subsection d in that case the division between subsections d and d would collapse and it would be superfluous to explicitly allow emission sources subject to d a general defense a review of the rules regulatory history confirms this reading of the text see first natl bank  fd at  in its final order and opinion the ipcb explained that section d and  are defense provisions for different types of sources final order illinois pollution control board in re particulate emission limitations rule g of chapter   ill env lexis  at  the stack testing method described in subsection d is clearly designed for accurate measurement of stack particulate emissions and is even the preferred method of demonstrating compliance under section d id at  however subsection d provides a broader defense than d because sources subject to it  may not have a stack or  may be allowed to use other methods in lieu of the stack test to show compliance id the ipcbs explanation of the difference between d and d establishes that its decision to divide § d into two subsections and provide subsection d with a general defense was purposeful it also establishes that the ipcb did not intend for the method described in d to be a safe harbor rather the method in subsection d is the method through which an emission unit subject to subsection d must establish the defense and only units covered by subsection d are allowed to use other methods in lieu of the stack test see id the us epas understanding of § d is consistent with the ipcbs as it commented on the clearly defined criteria for a sources use of compliance with the particulate regulations as a defense to a violation of the applicable opacity standards approval and promulgation of implementation plans illinois  fed reg  dec   in light of the clear structure of the regulation and the compelling regulatory history defendants arguments to the contrary must be rejected defendants primarily argue that § d does not restrict them because the text of the regulation is framed permissibly they note that subsection d provides a defense to opacity exceedances pointing to other regulatory provisions defendants argue that the ipcb knows how to draft exclusive defenses but elected not to use that sort of language in § d it did not describe the defense in § d as the defense the only defense the exclusive defense the sole defense or the single defense doc  at  this textual argument is right in a sense but it does not prove what defendants want it to prove the particulate matter defense is not the exclusive defense available for opacity exceedances indeed §  itself provides for defenses other than the particulate matter defense at issue here compare  ill admin code § a the startup malfunction and breakdown defense with id § d the particulate matter defense it is for that reason that the first sentence of subsection d generally states that compliance with the particulate regulations of this part shall constitute a defense  ill admin code § d emphasis added subsection d which uses parallel language to the first sentence of § d and also refers to itself as a defense can be read naturally to clarify the particulate matter defense defined in the first sentence by referring back to it see ratzlaf v united states  us    sct   ledd   a term appearing in several places in a statutory text is generally read the same way each time it appears the fact that the text of subsection d refers to the specific particulate matter defense as a defense does not mean that § d is broader it just means that § d itself is not an exclusive defense  fair notice finally defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on the particulate matter defense on the basis of the fair notice doctrine the fair notice doctrine prohibits courts from validating the application of a regulation that fails to give fair warning of the conduct it prohibits or requires gates  fox co v oshrc  fd   dccir when regulations and other policy statements issued by the relevant regulator are unclear  and where the agency itself struggles to provide a definitive reading of the regulatory requirements a regulated party is not on notice of the agencys ultimate interpretation of the regulations and may not be punished gen elec co v epa  fd   dccir courts assess whether a regulated entity had fair notice of the reach of a regulation by considering whether by reviewing the regulations and other public statements issued by the agency a regulated party acting in good faith would be able to identify with ascertainable certainty the standards with which the agency expects parties to conform united states v southern indiana gas and elec co  fsuppd   sdind quoting gen elec co  fd at  defendants contend that their reading of § d is reasonable and they argue that they lacked fair notice of any contrary interpretation that would subject edwards to § d this argument however does not contend with the ipcbs public statements defendants acting in good faith could have reasonably ascertained that edwards was subject to § d based upon the public statements issued by the ipcb at the time that it promulgated §  see southern indiana gas and elec co  fsuppd at  the ipcbs order definitively explained that § d does not apply to sources subject to  standards issued pursuant to sections  or  of the clean air act see in re particulate emission limitations  ill env lexis  at  defendants had fair notice that edwards was subject to § d during the relevant time period because it was not subject to any standards during that time defendants could have also reasonably ascertained that the method provided by § d was edwards sole available method of proving the particulate matter defense as explained above defendants could have looked to the text and structure of the regulation itself they could have also relied upon the ipcb and the us epas public statements which were consistent with the regulations text and structure see eg id at  explaining that one reason for the different defense provision between subsections d and d is that the performance test conducted in accordance with subsection d may not apply to sources subject to subsection d and sources subject to subject to d unlike those subject to d may have other methods for proving the defense available approval and promulgation of implementation plans illinois  fed reg  praising the clearly defined criteria for the particulate matter defense  conclusion section db provides the sole particulate matter defense available to defendants on counts one and two to satisfy it edwards needed to conduct a stack test while operating with an opacity that was equal to or greater than the original exceedance within sixty days of that exceedance there is no evidence that edwards conducted any such tests so plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on defendants particulate matter defense for those counts section da provides the sole particulate matter defense available to defendants on count three to satisfy it edwards needed to conduct a stack test under the same operating conditions that were present during the initial exceedance within sixty days of that exceedance plaintiffs are also entitled to summary judgment on defendants particulate matter defense for all exceedances on count three except for those that occurred within sixty days prior to a stack test which plaintiffs excluded from their motion defendants are not entitled to summary judgment as to counts one two and three because they have not shown through undisputed evidence compliance with § d b the startup malfunction and breakdown defense next defendants argue that the vast majority of the exceedances at issue are excusable because they occurred during periods of malfunction and breakdown defendants would need to rewrite the contours of this defense in order to take advantage of it for nearly all of the exceedances at issue the illinois sip provides that edwards may operate during periods of malfunction and breakdown if its permit allows it to do so see  ill admin code §§   a edwards permit does see permit condition a doc  at  operation in excess of applicable opacity particulate matter and carbon monoxide emission standards is allowed during periods of startup malfunction and breakdown when the illinois epa has granted permission to operate during periods of malfunction and breakdown full compliance with any terms and conditions connected with the permission shall be a prima facie defense to an enforcement action alleging violation of  the emission and air quality standards in the sip  ill admin code §  edwards permit imposes certain conditions on the plants ability to operate during malfunction and breakdown including requirements that the permittee  notify the illinois epas regional office by telephone as soon as possible during normal working hours upon the occurrence of excess emission due to malfunctions or breakdowns and maintain records of excess emissions during malfunctions and breakdowns  that include  the steps taken to prevent similar malfunctions or breakdowns permit conditions c dv doc  at   it is undisputed that edwards only notified the illinois epa of malfunctions or breakdowns on eight occasions during the relevant time period plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on this defense for all exceedances that they have not excluded from their motion because edwards needed to notify the illinois epa about each of them see permit condition c doc  at   ill admin code §  defendants however relying on an agreement with the illinois epa that is dehors the permit argue that they only needed to report exceedances that lasted longer than thirtyminutes to invoke this defense rather than reporting all of the emissions that fall outside of edwards opacity limitations as discussed below defendants arguments cannot be reconciled with the text of the sip or the permit condition c which requires that edwards report all opacity exceedances due to malfunction and breakdown therefore it must be rejected defendants have produced some evidence that edwards has a sideagreement with the illinois epa to only report exceedances that last longer than thirty minutes this includes edwards stayed and nonoperative title v permit which would require that edwards only report exceedances that are greater than thirty minutes doc  at  an internal email that predates the operative permit in which an environmental manager for edwards former operator discusses opacity related requirements and writes we have to report all periods when we exceed  on a unit for more that sic  consecutive minutes doc  and opacity operational guidance dated march   doc  such an agreement — if it existed — could not be reconciled with the text of the currently operative permit which says nothing about the duration of emissions and straightforwardly requires reporting upon the occurrence of excess emissions due to malfunctions or breakdowns permit condition c doc  at  defendants argue that the two could be squared because the permit requires that edwards comply with the illinois epas reasonable and safe directives with respect to malfunctions and breakdowns id but this argument reads the language of edwards permit out of context permit condition c requires that edwards first notify the illinois epas regional office by telephone when there are excess emissions and then comply with all reasonable and safe directives  regarding such malfunctions and breakdowns id the phrase such malfunctions and breakdowns naturally refers to the subset of malfunctions and breakdowns that edwards has already reported to the illinois epa regional office see such definition oxford english dictionary httpwwwoedcomviewentry last visited june   such refers to the character degree or extent described referred to or implied in what has been said the directives anticipated by the permit are specific directives regarding alreadyreported exceedances and not general directives with respect to all future excess emissions defendants also argue that edwards complied with the sip because most of the excess opacity emissions due to malfunction and breakdown were short and quickly corrected and the sip requires reporting during periods of continuous emission see  ill admin code §  this argument is also unpersuasive the text of §  states that its terms are preempted by contrary terms in the operating permit see id requiring reports during continued operation of an emission source in certain circumstances except if otherwise provided in the operating permit edwards permit requires reporting upon the occurrence of excess emission due to malfunctions or breakdowns permit condition c doc  at  this language in the permit controls over any arguably contrary language in the regulation see  ill admin code §  defendants attempt to rewrite the text of the permit through informal agreement must be rejected the purported agreement between edwards and the illinois epa is dehors the permit so it is immaterial no matter how longstanding the agreement may have been or its merit the agreement cannot modify or supplement permit condition c the court previously held that third parties like plaintiffs can independently enforce the terms of edwards permit under the clean air act see nat res def council v ameren energy resources co case no   wl  cdill oct   in such a context courts and plaintiffs alike should be able to rely upon the language of the permit and regulators reasonable interpretations of the language in the permit see nat res def council inc v texaco ref  mktg inc  fsuppd   n  ddel affd  fd  d cir in the clean water act context explaining that the agencys interpretation of the permit should be considered if not in conflict with the plain language of the permit emphasis added allowing for informal amendments to the text of the very document that the clean air act allows plaintiffs to enforce would undercut the purposes of the clean air acts citizen suit provision if edwards and the illinois epa wished to amend the permit they should have complied with the provisions of the illinois sip that allow for amendment see  ill admin code §  the agency may revise any permit issued  or any condition contained in such permit  upon reapplication by the permittee or  upon the revision of the statute or regulations defendants argue as a fallback that they can prove the malfunction and breakdown defense even if they have not complied with the conditions associated with the permit they say that the prima facie defense provides the easiest method if the record reflected that edwards complied with the terms and conditions of the malfunction and breakdown defense in its permit it would presumptively establish the defense but they argue that this doesnt preclude the opportunity to establish a malfunction and breakdown defense the hard way without the presumption provided for by the prima facie defense however compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit provides the only method through which edwards can prove the malfunction and breakdown defense here a prima facie defense is synonymous with an affirmative defense see lutz v chesapeake appalachia llc  fd   th cir  explaining that only once a defendant has made a prima facie defense will the burden shift  to the plaintiff to establish an exception premier capital mgmt llc v cohen no  c   wl  at  ndill mar   thus plaintiffs need only rebut if the defendants make out a prima facie affirmative defense and do not need to preemptively offer facts to overcome the defenses as part of their case in chief allowing defendants to prove the malfunction and breakdown defense in some way other than compliance with the permits conditions would present an unworkable legal problem there would be no clear boundaries on the defense in other states the malfunction and breakdown defense is often defined by regulation for example georgia regulations provide that excess emissions resulting from startup shutdown or malfunction of any source which occur through ordinary diligence is employed shall be allowed so long as  the best operational practices to reduce emissions were used  pollution control equipment was operated properly and  the duration of excess emissions was minimized sierra club v georgia power co  fd   th cir discussing ga comp r  regs ai and in texas power plants must meet ten criteria in order to establish the defense including showing that opacity was properly documented and reported to the regulator see sierra club v energy future holdings corp no wcv  wl  at  wdtex march   discussing  tex admin code § d e illinois has not promulgated these sorts of standards through regulation instead the standards are included in the permits issued to power plants therefore without reference to the permit conditions there would be no obvious elements to the malfunction and breakdown defense that edwards would need to satisfy finally defendants argue that they would be denied fair notice if the court concluded that they were liable for clean air act violations because they failed to comply with the permits reporting requirements for malfunctions and breakdowns as previously explained courts determine whether a regulated entity had fair notice by reviewing the regulations and other public statements issued by the agency and determining whether a regulated party acting in good faith would be able to identify with ascertainable certainty the standards with which the agency expects parties to conform southern indiana gas and elec co  fsuppd at  quoting gen elec co  fd at  defendants fair notice defense is unpersuasive because they cannot point to any textual ambiguity in the permit that was issued by the illinois epa nor can they point to any public statements by the illinois epa that are contrary to the language included in the permit defendants fair notice argument is better conceived of as an argument that plaintiffs should be estopped from enforcing the permit because defendants reasonably relied upon private statements made by the illinois epa that are contrary to the language of the permit to establish an estoppel defense defendants would need to among other things show that they reasonably relied upon statements made by plaintiffs see edgewater hosp inc v bowen  fd   th cir they have not done so and at oral argument counsel for defendants conceded that they were not making an estoppel argument edwards cannot satisfy the malfunction and breakdown defense for those unreported exceedances therefore plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment as to the malfunction and breakdown defense is granted for those exceedances at issue in their motion to the extent that defendants have sought summary judgment on the eight properlyreported exceedances their motion is denied because they have not provided evidence of compliance with each of the other conditions associated with permission to operate during periods of malfunction and breakdown c offline defense finally the parties dispute the applicability of the opacity regulations during periods in which the emission units at edwards were not operating approximately  of the opacity exceedances for which plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment occurred during periods when the operating unit was offline and undergoing maintenance activities the parties agree that edwards visible emissions exceeded thirtypercent opacity during these periods of maintenance indeed defendants expert richard mcranie opined that opacity excursions can occur during offlineshutdown periods for a variety of reasons most of the reasons revolve around maintenance activities inside the boiler ductwork and esp doc  at  plaintiffs conceed that edwards particulate matter limitations do not apply to units during these periods defendants argue that opacity limitations should not either in sierra club v georgia power no cvjtc  us dist lexis  ndga jan   a district court in georgia determined that opacity limits do not apply to coalfired power plants in georgia when a unit is not operating id at  that court examined both the record and the georgia sip which exempts maintenance activities from emissions standards and concluded that nothing in the record indicates that the opacity regulations are intended to control offline exceedances as opposed to those exceedances relating to the combustion of fuel which occur while the unit is operating id at  defendants argue that this logic should apply here especially because opacity goes handinhand with particulate matter limitations they point primarily to the structure of § db for support section db as discussed earlier allows power plants to excuse periods of heightened opacity by showing compliance with particulate matter emissions under the same operating conditions defendants argue that by framing the particulate matter defense in these terms § db implies that actionable opacity exceedances only occur when a unit is operating otherwise there would be opacity exceedances for which the particulate matter defense could not apply unlike in georgia power however other aspects of edwards permit and the illinois sip imply that opacity limits apply even when a unit is offline certain other states limit the applicability of opacity limits during periods of maintenance see georgia power  us dist lexis  at  pub citizen v am elec power co no cvdf  wl  at  edtex dec   sierra club v energy future holdings corp  fsuppd   wdtex  but defendants cannot point to an analogous section of the illinois sip that limits the applicability of opacity regulations during periods of maintenance or shutdown indeed edwards opacity limitation is framed as a uniform thirtypercent limit with no reference to whether the unit is operating or undergoing maintenance see  ill admin code § a permit condition  doc  at  in light of this the court concludes that opacity limits continue to apply during periods of maintenance defendants are correct that opacity is most often used as a proxy for particulate matter that is why the particulate matter defense in § db exists but just because particulate matter emissions cannot be measured during times of maintenance or shutdown does not mean that the opacity limits should not apply during those times indeed there are strong policy reasons that it should opaque clouds that edwards emits during maintenance activities could have preventable and high amounts of unmeasured particulate matter it is sensible then to subject those emissions to the opacity limits even if the particulate matter defense cannot apply if illinois wished to create explicit exemptions from generally applicable opacity limits during periods of maintenance it could have see eg georgia power  us dist lexis  at  it did not and interpreting the illinois sip to imply that it did would conflict with the epas determination that units are not exempt from opacity regulations during periods of offline maintenance see state implementation plans response to petition for rulemaking  fed reg   june   the epa does not agree with commenters that total exemptions from opacity emission limitations during maintenance activities are consistent with caa requirements for sip provisions  maintenance activities are predictable and planned activities during which sources should be expected to comply with applicable emission limitations for these reasons defendants motion for summary judgment on this issue is granted as to count three the fact that edwards was offline however is not a defense to counts one and two conclusion for the foregoing reasons plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment doc  is granted in part and denied in part the court concludes that plaintiffs have standing to bring this lawsuit grants summary judgment to plaintiffs on all opacity exceedances in counts one and two for which they have moved for summary judgment and grants summary judgment to plaintiffs on all exceedances for which they have moved for summary judgment with respect to count three except for those opacity exceedances that occurred while the relevant unit was offline defendants motion for summary judgment doc  is granted with respect to those particulate matter exceedances in count three that occurred while the relevant unit was offline but otherwise denied plaintiffs motion to strike doc  is denied as moot plaintiffs motion to exclude certain expert testimony doc  remains pending by september   plaintiffs shall notify the court whether this order has mooted any of the issues raised in that motion it is so ordered footnotes  unless otherwise noted the facts in the following section are taken from the undisputed facts as determined by the court from the parties summary judgment briefing see docs    and   a fourth plaintiff environmental law and policy center was voluntarily dismissed on february   doc   plaintiffs brought their original complaint against ameren energy resources generating company aerg which owned and operated the plant from the start of the relevant time period until december   and its parent company ameren energy resources company doc  iprg the current owner and operator of the plant assumed aergs liabilities following a merger in their motion for partial summary judgment plaintiffs have only moved for summary judgment against iprg and have not moved for summary judgment against ipr both defendants however have moved for summary judgment in their crossmotion for simplicitys sake the court may refer to edwards rather than iprg at points in this opinion  the sip was adopted by the illinois pollution control board and approved by the us epa pursuant to  usc §   the sip requires that plants like edwards obtain an operating permit see  ill admin code §  edwards permit bears an expiration date of june   and the illinois epa issued edwards a subsequent operating permit pursuant to title v of the clean air act however the title v permit has been stayed by order of the illinois pollution control board see ameren energy generating co edwards power station v iepa pcb  feb   so the permit issued on june   remains in effect see  ill comp stat b the court has previously held that the terms and conditions of the permit are federally enforceable under the citizen suit provision of the clean air act see natural res def council v ameren energy res co case no   wl  cdill oct    particulate matter is any solid or liquid material other than water which exists in finely divided form  ill admin code §   opacity is the degree to which particulate matter emissions reduce the transmission of light and obscure the view of an object in the background  ill admin code §   it is undisputed that these  exceedances do not qualify for a regulatory exemption that the parties refer to as the minute exemption the minute exemption provides that edwards emissions can have an opacity between thirty and sixty percent for a period or periods aggregating  minutes in any  minute period see  ill admin code § b the exemption does not apply if heightened emissions occur from both of edwards stacks during the sixtyminute period or if the heightened emissions occur more than three times in  hours id  subparts d through t of part  of the illinois sip establish particulate matter limitations for a variety of different types of emission sources including sources that are different from edwards edwards particulate matter limits are included among those in subpart e which establishes limits for emissions from fuel combustion emission units see  ill admin code §§  but subpart d for example covers particulate matter emissions from incinerators see  ill admin code §§   plaintiffs argue that edwards became subject to section  for purpose of the regulation on april   which was the deadline for existing power plants to comply with the us epas mercury and air toxics standard which was issued pursuant to  usc § d see  cfr §  it is worth noting that in arguing that edwards was not subjection to section  of the clean air act plaintiffs are not arguing that edwards was not subject to other clean air act obligations indeed it is edwards clean air act obligations that give rise to this lawsuit edwards was subject to the illinois sip regulations which implement section  of the clean air act see  usc §§   defendants insistence that it is the us epas official policy that edwards was subject to section  is unpersuasive in the meyers memorandum issued on january   the epas principal deputy assistant administrator wrote to the us epas regional administrators regarding the application of caa section g to coal and oilfired electric utility steam generating units that began actual construction or reconstruction between march   and march   doc  at  meyers wrote the memo after the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated a rule that had delisted coalfired power plants see new jersey v epa  fd  dccir  he concluded that since those plants remain on the section c list they are subject to section g doc  at  the memorandum was written in a particular context assessing whether units that began construction or reconstruction following the delisting rule but prior to the delisting rules vacatur needed to comply with section g defendants reliance on this language to suggest that edwards is subject to chapter  of the caa for purposes of § d takes the memorandum out of this particular context which has nothing to do with an interpretation of § d indeed defendants position is inconsistent with the position that the us epa subsequently took in litigation where § d was squarely at issue see complaint united states v midwest generation llc no cv at ¶¶           ndill aug    the us epas understanding of § d is highly relevant as the clean air act required that the us epa approve the illinois sip and any changes to it see  usc §   during oral argument defendants conceded that these conditions in permit condition  were the sort that they needed to comply with in order to establish the prima facie defense provided by  ill admin code §   plaintiffs excluded from their motion the eight exceedances for which defendants notified the illinois epa but do not concede that defendants satisfied the malfunction and breakdown defense for those exceedances  plaintiffs also challenge defendants compliance with permit condition s record keeping requirements it is unnecessary to resolve whether edwards kept proper records of
