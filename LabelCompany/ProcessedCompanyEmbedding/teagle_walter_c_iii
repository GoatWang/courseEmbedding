teagle foundation inc annotate this case  conn   frank e mott et al executors estate of walter c teagle v the teagle foundation inc et al supreme court of connecticut argued april   decided april   king c j alcorn house thim and ryan js everett fisher with whom was charles s bradford for the plaintiffs john s barton for the named defendant william c strong and william a phillips with whom on the brief was frank j coyle for the defendant jane w boggs et al  francis j mcnamara jr with whom on the brief were robert f grele and ridgeway m hall jr for the guardian ad litem for the defendant jayne w teagle et al king c j this is a reservation on an agreed statement of facts seeking the construction of certain portions of the last will and testament of walter c teagle who died on january   a resident of greenwich at the age of eightythree the will was executed march   a little over six months thereafter walter c teagle jr the testators only child died leaving his widow jane w teagle now mrs boggs and three children brenda l teagle now mrs essex jayne w teagle and walter c teagle iii the problems in construction concern the provisions made for the teagle foundation inc hereinafter sometimes referred to as the foundation a taxexempt charitable corporation established by the testator under the laws of connecticut on june   and to which the testator during his lifetime made contributions from time to time in the approximate total amount of  the testator was a man of great wealth with assets at the time he made his will and also at the time of his death amounting to over  before his death he had made provision by trusts or outright gifts for each of his three grandchildren in the amount of over  apiece in article sixth of his will he made abundant provision for his own widow and she takes no position in this suit and was defaulted for failure to appear the foundation makes certain claims as to the proper computation and composition of the balance  of my estate disposed of by this my will as the phrase is used in article twelfth the other defendants mrs boggs and her children are in agreement among themselves as to the proper construction of the will but do not agree with the construction claimed by the foundation article fourth article thirteenth and subdivisions   and  of article twentieth are also involved in the determination of the basic controversy as to the computation and composition of the balance referred to in article twelfth article twelfth reads as follows twelfth i give devise and bequeath a portion of my estate equal in value to twothirds  of the balance of my estate disposed of by this my will and remaining after payment or provision for the payment of my debts funeral expenses administration expenses and bequests hereinbefore made but before the payment or provision for the payment of any taxes referred to in article nineteenth hereof to the teagle foundation incorporated article fourth reads in material part as follows i give devise and bequeath to my son walter c teagle jr if he survives me or if he does not survive me i direct that the same shall be added to my residuary estate to be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of article thirteenth hereof the property referred to in article fourth consisted of a hunting preserve in florida and a second hunting preserve in new york including in each instance all buildings thereon and all rights and easements appurtenant thereto together with all tangible personal property located thereon or used in connection therewith each of these hunting preserves was extensively used by the testator his son and their friends the subject matter of article  fourth had a total appraised value of about  and included the only real estate owned by the testator at the time of his death since walter c teagle jr failed to survive his father the alternative provision of article fourth became operative providing i direct that the  property which would have gone to walter c teagle jr had he survived the testator shall be added to my residuary estate to be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of article thirteenth hereof article thirteenth provided in relevant part that all the rest residue and remainder of my property and estate both real and personal of whatsoever kind and wheresoever situated of which i shall die seized or possessed or of which i shall be entitled to dispose at the time of my death hereinafter referred to as my residuary estate i direct shall be disposed of as follows  b if as was the case my son walter c teagle jr does not survive me but his wife jane will teagle does survive me i give devise and bequeath my residuary estate to the trustees hereinafter named or their successors in trust this residuary trust is to be held for the benefit of the testators daughterinlaw and on her death for the benefit of the testators then living descendants only if there are no living descendants upon the final termination of the trust does the foundation receive any part of the residue although each of the four questions reserved involves the computation and composition of the balance of my estate under the formula set forth in article twelfth the questions fall into two main  classes the first two questions involve the foundations claim that the alternative gift over in article fourth should not be excluded from the formula balance as a bequest hereinbefore made the third and fourth questions involve the foundations claim that the deduction of administration expenses as used in article twelfth applies only to those administration expenses which the executors pursuant to authority admittedly adequately given them under article twentieth subdivisions   and  decide to pay out of principal rather than out of income i there is and could be no dispute that had walter c teagle jr survived his father the property forming the subject matter of article fourth would have been excluded from the balance because it would clearly have been one of the bequests hereinbefore made as provided in article twelfth but the foundation claims that the alternative provision applicable because of the sons failure to survive his father was not itself an operative bequest under article fourth that the only operative bequest in the alternative provision of article fourth was under article thirteenth and that  since this article followed article twelfth in the will there actually was no bequest hereinbefore made within the meaning of article twelfth the foundation claims that the language of the alternative provision in article fourth providing that the property involved shall be added to my residuary estate to be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of article thirteenth hereof disposes of nothing and leaves the disposition of the property to be controlled wholly by article thirteenth subdivision b which did make use of the standard dispositive phrase i give devise and bequeath which was lacking in the alternative provision in article fourth we may assume without so deciding that the foundation is correct in claiming that the phrase bequests hereinbefore made applies only to effective bequests as distinguished from lapsed void or otherwise inoperative bequests cranes appeal  root conn   but we cannot accept the foundations basic claim that the alternative disposition of the property made in article fourth was not a complete and effective disposition so as to fall into the classification of bequests hereinbefore made the property in article fourth falls into the residuum not by virtue of any statute or rule of law nor by virtue of anything in article thirteenth standing alone but by virtue of the express language of article fourth which so provides and incorporates by reference article thirteenth  page wills boweparker rev  §  p  the words shall be added to my residuary estate to be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of article thirteenth constituted an adequate dispositive provision for at least two independent reasons  first it is not necessary to use the words give devise and bequeath or any other classic verbal formula to accomplish an effective testamentary gift all that is required and it certainly existed here is a clear expression of the testators dispositive intent see cases such as angus v noble  conn    a  beardsley v merry  conn    ad  dennen v searle  conn    ad  second the incorporation by reference did carry into article fourth and thereby made part of article fourth the provisions of article thirteenth which defined and in great detail disposed of the residuary estate and which did contain the classic phrase i give devise and bequeath it was wholly unnecessary for the testator to repeat verbatim in the alternative provision of article fourth the lengthy provisions of article thirteenth to incorporate them by reference was not only equally effective but was preferable draftsmanship primarily the residuum in this will is for the benefit of the members of the family of the testator and his descendants this is obviously not true of the balance described in article twelfth the primary gift to the foundation constitutes twothirds of the balance of my estate which is a fund entirely different from the residuum computed and composed according to the formula set forth in article twelfth it is estimated that the foundations primary gift of twothirds of the balance will amount to about  while the entire residuum will amount to about  the very fact that the testator went to the trouble of establishing this special formula balance makes it clear that he treated it as entirely different as in fact it was from the residue established under article thirteenth  both the foundation and the other defendants place considerable reliance on the case of first national bank  trust co v baker  conn    ad  although the will in that case as in this contained a preresiduary trust fund the baker case was concerned in relevant part with a deficiency in assets needed to satisfy all particular gifts we are concerned with no such problem here but we find nothing in the baker case inconsistent with the result which we reach in this case furthermore precedents are generally inconclusive in will construction suits at least unless they lay down general rules for the construction of wills since in each will the language used by the testator and the circumstances surrounding him differ in each case it is the intention expressed by the particular language employed which must be construed connecticut bank  trust co v lyman  conn    ad  in the present case without resort to precedents construing different even though somewhat similar language in portions of other wills it is clear that the property embraced in article fourth is to be excluded as a bequest hereinbefore made from the formula balance established in article twelfth ii another exclusion to be made in computing the formula balance in article twelfth consists of the administration expenses the foundation claims that the phrase administration expenses should not be accorded its primary meaning but should be construed as including only those administration expenses which the executors pursuant to the authority conferred upon them in article twentieth decide to pay out of principal  as a matter of fact the executors have tentatively decided to pay out of principal approximately onehalf of the total administration expenses we find no merit in the foundations claim there is no justification for changing the clear wording and primary meaning of the phrase administration expenses in article twelfth to read such administration expenses as the executors decide to pay out of principal the phrase administration expenses clearly includes in its ordinary and primary meaning all administration expenses properly allowed in the executors accounting to the court regardless of whether the executors pursuant to authority conferred on them in article twentieth pay those expenses from principal or income see cases such as first national bank  trust co v baker supra  burnham v hayford  conn    ad  see also  page wills boweparker rev  §  p  the function of this court is to construe the language used by the testator and thus to ascertain and give effect to his expressed intent we have no power to change that language or to rewrite his will see cases such as first new haven national bank v first new haven national bank  conn    ad  griswold v first national bank  conn     ad  iii the questions upon which our advice is desired are a are the real property and tangible personal property referred to in article fourth or the proceeds thereof included in the phrase bequests hereinbefore made in article twelfth b should the value of the real property and  tangible personal property referred to in article fourth be included in computing the balance of testators estate referred to in article twelfth a portion equal to twothirds  of which is bequeathed to the teagle foundation incorporated c in arriving at the balance of testators estate referred to in article twelfth a portion equal to twothirds  of which is bequeathed to the teagle foundation incorporated should there be deducted only those administration expenses which the executors actually charge to and pay from the principal of the estate as allowed in the judicial accountings of the executors d if the answer to question c is no in arriving at the balance of testators estate referred to in article twelfth should there be deducted all administration expenses however charged or paid as allowed in the judicial accountings of the executors our answer to questions a and d is yes and to questions b and c is no in this opinion the other judges concurred notes  article fourteenth contains provisions to avoid any violation of the rule against perpetuities but is not otherwise involved in this proceeding  parenthetically it perhaps should be pointed out that there is no claim by anyone that the phrase bequests hereinbefore made was inadequate to embrace the real estate referred to in article fourth we think it probable that the quoted phrase was an inadvertance on the part of the scrivener presumably arising because article fourth concerned the only real estate owned by the testator and thus was the only gift which embraced real estate the word bequest while inapt to include a gift of real estate we think quite obviously should be read here as embracing the real estate in each hunting preserve as well as the tangible personal property  respectively used in connection therewith  am jur wills §   page wills boweparker rev  §  search this case google scholar google books legal blogs
