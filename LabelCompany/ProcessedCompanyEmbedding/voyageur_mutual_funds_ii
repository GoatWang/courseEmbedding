prospectus from your investment representative or from voyageur  south seventh street suite  minneapolis mn    local  mktg letter from the president photo andrew m mccullagh jr president dear shareholder since our last report the headline story in the municipal bond market has been the demise of a radical tax reform one of the best ways to illustrate this demise is to look at how municipal bonds have traded in relation to treasury securities at the height of the tax reform scare  when steve forbes was campaigning on his flat tax platform in january   long municipal securities were trading at a very cheap  of treasuries at the time of this report market fears have abated and municipal bonds are trading at a more traditional  we believe the issue of reforming the tax code is far from thoroughly closed and it is likely  in this a us presidential election year  that we may see renewed discussions about less radical tax reforms however as is often the case in the financial markets we believe these times of shortterm volatility and uncertainty represent good opportunities for longterm investors at voyageur we continue to stress the importance of maintaining a longterm view  in both the investment horizons of our shareholders and in our approach to purchasing securities for the voyageur tax free funds in order to select the best longterm securities for the funds we favor purchasing negotiated new municipal issues over those in the secondary or competitive market unlike the taxable bond market where the structure of new bond issues are frequently predetermined and fixed we have more flexibility and negotiating power in determining how a municipal bond issue will be structured in many cases our credit research analysts  who are experienced experts in the area of municipal bond transactions  work closely with municipal bond issuers to determine the appropriate structure for new bond issues our analysts intimate knowledge of whats in the market and their ability to actually dissect individual municipal securities helps us to determine appropriate prices that accurately reflect an issuers strength and value while assisting us in protecting our shareholders interests they also help us pinpoint rising and falling stars  bonds whose credits may be upgraded or downgraded  in the municipal market we remain committed to providing our clients with the best investment products and services available in todays financial markets the voyageur tax free funds allow you access to a wide variety of national and statespecific municipal bonds funds all of which are actively managed to meet their individual fund objectives as part of our commitment to you we have also redesigned our shareholder reports to provide you with more indepth information about your voyageur fund investments in an easiertoread format we welcome any comments you may have about these changes and encourage you to call our voyageur shareholder services at  if at any time you have questions about your voyageur fund investments please contact your personal financial advisor or voyageur shareholder services our voyageur shareholder services  number  known as voyageur on

continued patronage of voyageur funds and look forward to working with you and your financial advisors in creating products and services designed to bring you closer to your investment goals sincerely andrew m mccullagh jr president voyageur colorado tax free fund voyageur colorado tax free fund photo andrew m mccullagh jr is the senior municipal bond manager for the voyageur colorado tax free fund mr mccullagh has more than  years of investment industry experience for the six months ended june   the total return at net asset value nav for the voyageur colorado tax free funds class a shares was  within the fund we maintained our longterm outlook for lower interest rates by keeping our funds durations long as compared to the industry average although this caused the funds performance to lag slightly when interest rates rose we believe the worst is over and are expecting to see a turnaround in interest rates later this year or early  areas of opportunity in the funds holdings we remained committed to purchasing municipal bonds with high credit ratings emphasizing securities in the general obligation and health care sectors during the past six months we continued to search for areas or sectors where we could add value to the portfolios of the voyageur colorado tax free fund one such area has been to include investments that have added income to the fund although we still maintain our commitment to total return we believe this addition of income will allow us to dampen the effects of market volatility while allowing our shareholders to benefit from higher income streams we believe another area of opportunity is our investment in the lowry redevelopment agency which represents  of the funds total assets the lowry redevelopment agency is redeveloping the property that was once lowry air force base before the government shut it down we believe this property  which is  minutes from downtown denver  should prove to be an attractive investment for the fund in order to attempt to protect our shareholders current income level for a longer period of time we have continued to take advantage of opportunities to to extend the funds call protection due to this focus the fund now has an average call protection of approximately eight years outlook for the municipal market unlike the colorado of the s today the state is booming from a broaderbased economy and population growth industries in colorado include telecommunications financial services computers  all in addition to the old mainstays of oil and tourism in the us economy we are still seeing signs of moderate growth with moderate inflation  a trend we expect to see continue for the remainder of the year our outlook for the municipal market continues to be favorable and we expect interest rates to decline over the long term this has caused us to maintain a longer duration in the fund in order to take advantage of this trend past performance is no guarantee of future results enlargedownload table
