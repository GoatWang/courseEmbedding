premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search why the spectranetics corporation shares burst today a tepid first quarter and disappointing guidance caused the spectranetics corporation shares to trade lower todd campbell tmfebcapital apr   at pm although we dont believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements we do like to keep an eye on big changes  just in case theyre material to our investing thesis what shares in the spectranetics corporation nasdaqspnc tumbled by more than  earlier today after the company reported disappointing first quarter earnings after the bell yesterday so what the maker of medical devices used in cardiovascular procedures reported sales of  million during the first quarter the company also reported an adjusted net loss of  per share although sales grew  from last year the companys adjusted net loss was worse than the loss of  reported a year ago due to costs associated with new products revenue and earnings per share also missed analyst estimates by  million and  respectively additionally the spectranetics corporation issued guidance that was disappointing the company kept its forecast for sales growth of between  and  this year unchanged but admitted that its more likely that growth will trend toward the low end of this range its earnings guidance was even less inspiring the company estimates that its net loss will be within a range of  million to  million and thats worse than its prior estimate for a loss of between  million and  million now what the companys conservative sales forecast stems from increasing competition tied to the launch of new products that are vying for share against the spectranetics corporations angiosculpt those introductions have led to the company reducing the low end of its outlook for angiosculpt revenue from a forecast of between  million and  million this year to a range of between  million and  million this year lower angiosculpt sales and increased spending tied to the acquisition and integration of the stellarex program which was acquired from covidien last fall are behind the companys lowered profit guidance overall while patient demographics should support demand for cardiovascular procedures for years to come investors may want to wait to see how the competitive picture develops and for the stellarex headwinds to abate before stepping in and
