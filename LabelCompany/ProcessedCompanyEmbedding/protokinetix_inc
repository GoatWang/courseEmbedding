the institute for scientific application insa of france for her work in this area dr castelotdeliencourt was honored in  with frances highest award for scientific accomplishment  the francinov award protokinetix protokinetix is a biotechnology company that provides medical researchers with a platform for enhancing cell survival and health both in vitro and in vivo at the heart of its technology is its patented antiaging glycopeptide aagp™ this small molecule  daltons displays abilities in resolving challenges confronting medical researchers in such areas as regenerative medicine and as a therapy for diseases relating to tissue inflammation and oxidation stress because of its stability small size and molecular makeup it maintains its function in vivo without triggering the bodys immune system further it can function without toxic side effects common in treatments involving larger and less stable compounds these abilities are verified through testing in such areas as extension of stem cell harvesting purification expansion cryopreservation and reengraftment see test results  protocols  bioactivity assays  effect of aagp™ on maintaining stem cell number and function in mouse

examine the properties of aagp™ to determine how it can accelerate their development of a new generation of treatments cures and cellsurvival solutions it should be noted that currently there is ongoing independent research in such areas as uveitis and in monoclonalantibody production aagp™ is manufactured at facilities in north america europe and asia for shipment worldwide interested

model management  directors bio  kevin gregoryevans news investors aagps™ overview protokinetix antiaging glycopeptide trademarked aagp™ is a small  daltons stable synthetic replicas of the larger  daltons less stable afgp which has been found to have protective properties in nature the small size of aagp™ enables it to penetrate cells and allows it to pass through both cell and capillary junctions in vivo in addition its bioactivity at a variety of phs  and temperatures °c to °c and efficiency at concentrations mgml is well below its toxic dose mgml making it a candidate to enter into the next stages of translational research aagp™ has a chemical formula of chcifno solubility in water of gl and is also soluble in methanol ethanol and dmso the optimal concentration is mgml depending on cell line and stress test the optimal is ph    depending on cell line and stress test cellprotection assays aagp™ has gone through a series of tests in various outsourced laboratories in europe and north america these tests have proven its ability to protect a multitude of cell lines hela cells adult fibroblast neonatal fibroblasts human neuronal stem cells mouse neuronal stem cells mouse islet cells blood platelets cd cells and keratinocytes against uva uvc hydrogen peroxide inflammatory ilβ time temperature °c °c °c °c °c °c and °c and low serum induced cell death at phs from   the average increase in cell survival credited to aagp™ in the face of these conditions was over  this cannot be attributed to aagp™ increasing cell proliferation as it had been found that aagp™ has no affect on cell doubling times in either hela or fibroblast cells in addition to protecting cell survival aagp™ also preserves cell functionality this has been tested via stem cell markers cd functionality tests and in vivo studies where aagp™ treated transplanted islet cells were found to reduce blood glucose concentrations in diabetic mice by  by day  in comparison to islet cells which were transplanted into mice without first being exposed to aagp™ mechanism of action the mechanism of action of aagp™ is now under study however its ability to protect against inflammation induced cell death in exposure to hydrogen peroxide uva and uvc suggests a role for aagp™ in the inflammation pathway in addition when exposed to an inflammatory mediator interleukin β ilβ the presence of aagp™ reduced cox expression three fold inflammation plays a major role in many pathological conditions suggesting aagp™ may not just be usable in cell and organ storage but also in pharmacological treatments the full results of these extensive tests can be found in the test results  protocols section of the website antifreeze glycoproteins afgps to antiaging glycopeptides aagps™ afgps have proven useful in many applications however they are limited by their cost approximately gram instability and size    daltons their large size restricts their use in medicine as they are unable to pass through capillaries into interstitial tissue and are unable to reach target cells molecules must be less than  daltons to diffuse through the capillaries in addition molecules must be less than  daltons to pass through cell junctions into neighbouring cells and less than  daltons to cross the bloodbrain barrier with these issues in mind dr geraldinecastelotdeliencourt invented aagp™ to be a smaller more stable

lines” says jeff schulz ceo proactive immune sciences “we are hoping to prove through our research that aagp will have a positive affect on helping immune cells recover from the cryopreservation process any improvement in cell survival rate or cell function could have significant positive benefits for future treatments using cryopreserved immune cells pending a successful outcome of our research the intent is for proactive to enter into a licensing agreement with protokinetix for the cryopreservation of immune cells this will give proactive customers the benefit of knowing their stored immune cells will perform at the highest levels possible should they require them for any immune cell based cancer or immune system reconstitution later in their life” about immune cell banking

website httpwwwprotokinetixcom  st marys w va  business wire  protokinetix incorporated otc pktx the company or protokinetix wwwprotokinetixcom updates its stockholders on the testing of neuronal retinal cells in living tissue at the university of british columbia “ubc” under the guidance of dr gregoryevans  as explained by dr gregoryevans the research program at ubc will be determining whether aagp™ can help improve the survival of stem cells that are currently being used in human trials to treat retinal blindness we are doing this because of the poor outcome in the current state of play using stem cells in the treatment of blindness proof of principal work has been done in animal models but these successes are few and far between what has been seen most recently is that probably as few as  of injected cells are surviving more than a week although this is adequate for proof of principle work it is not good enough for developing a clinical medical treatment we are looking for ways to improve cell survival in actual living eyes  the researchers at ubc have reached the conclusion that aagp™ should provide the required level of protection to ensure postengraftment survival one reason is theoretical and one is experimental the theoretical basis is that when tissue is damaged that tissue breaks down and releases toxins into its environment we believe that aagp™ can work to reduce the harmful effects of these toxins based on previous tests conducted by the company aagp™ has demonstrated significant antiinflammatory properties the experimental basis for our hypothesis is that we have tested the drug in tissue culture in the lab and found that it improves the survival of cells  the current work that we are doing is taking those results and that theory and looking at it now in living tissue to see if we can reproduce the successes that we achieved before we have established a new type of model for retinal degeneration in a rabbit and are currently working on injecting neuronal cells plus aagp™ to see if we can see any improvement long term in how these cells survive and integrate into the retina and hopefully lead to vision restoration in the animals  “we hope to achieve results in experiments more closely aligned with human disease if that is the case the molecule could become a major advance in the field of stem cells and blindness” dr kevin

incorporated otcqbpktx the company or protokinetix wwwprotokinetixcom is pleased to announce that their molecule aagp an antifreeze glycopeptide that mimics a naturally occurring glycoprotein found in arctic fish is helping to significantly improve the efficacy of cell transplant treatments for diabetes  a procedure that transplants insulin producing islet to render them insulin independent for periods of time antiaging glycopeptide aagp is the focus of a new study published in the journal diabetes researchers from the university of albertas faculty of medicine  dentistry found that by soaking islet cells in aagp for an hour and then washing it off prior to transplantation the cells were protected from tacrolimus an antirejection drug commonly used during transplants that is toxic to islets cells   normally when we expose human islets to tacrolimus in the petri dish they flat line and dont release insulin at all says james shapiro senior author of the study and canada research chair in transplant surgery and regenerative medicine at the u of a when we add the aagp and wash it all off the cells work perfectly normally and are protected in a remarkably durable manner we find we need far fewer cells to treat diabetes in our preclinical models than we would normally  since his creation of the edmonton protocol in  more than  patients have been treated by shapiro through islet cell transplantation a key challenge of the procedure though is that most patients typically need two islet infusions each prepared from a separate pancreas organ donor shapiro says there arent enough organ donors to meet demand through the use aagp a greater number of islet cells will survive the procedure potentially allowing more patients to be treated   just a one hour soak in aagp is enough to protect the islet cells for up to a month or two afterwards it has a very potent and profound effect says shapiro as a direct result of these findings were now moving forward with plans for a first in human clinical trialled at the university of albertatesting this drug in our human islet cell transplant program  this synthetic molecule seems to provide significant protection to cells exposed to multiple deleterious conditions such as uv radiation starvation extreme temperatures andoxidative stress says boris galalopez lead author of the study and a clinicalresearch fellow at the u of as department of surgery we are certainly very excited for the multiple opportunities this finding entails to the field of transplantation research  funding for the study was provided by the diabetes research institute foundation of canada while the drug aagp was provided by protokinetix   we are very excited to have our aagp molecule showcased in this prestigious journal we are also extremely confident in the ongoing success of our collaboration with dr james shapiro and his outstanding team said clarence smith president and chairman of protokinetix if proven successful in human clinical trials shapiro believes the inclusion of aagp could soon become a permanent addition to the edmonton protocol representing a significant step forward in the treatment of type  diabetes

study press release  september    protokinetix otcbb pktx wwwprotokinetixcom is pleased to announce that it has received excellent results from the eye inflammation study conducted by ubc university of british columbia the tests conducted by dr gregoryevans md phd frcs frcophth were designed to determine whether the powerful antiinflammatory aagp™ molecule could be successfully delivered to inflamed areas throughout the eye the result demonstrated that aagp™ penetrates through the extremely protective barriers of the eye without side effects protokinetix has proven the ability of aagp™ to protect human cells against inflammation causing agents there are many forms of eye inflammation that are typically treated with an aggressive course of corticosteroids due in part to the short effective life of topical steroids current treatments involve the application on an hourly basis these powerful drugs can lead to numerous sight threatening complications dr gregoryevans a professor of ophthalmology and leadership chair in macular research concludes that aagp™ penetrates the eye when topically applied as a twice a day or four times a day regimen aagp™ can be detected within the cornea and ciliary body drug was also seen to appear in retinal tissue most convincingly when a four times a day regimen was used these results represent a major step in the development of a potent

pharmaceutical laboratories monoclonal antibodies have proven themselves to be highly effective therapies and diagnostics in a growing list of diseases access to this class of drug is extremely restricted due to the prohibitive cost in order for monoclonal antibodies to be universally available the cost has to be aggressively reduced initial results from these tests demonstrate a  to  increase in monoclonal antibody production in the presence of aagp™ this significant increase in yield will result in major cost reductions for the treatment of cardio vascular disease autoimmune
