alternativemay  about colony northstar clns brad thomas dividend growth investing reits newsletter provider valuemarketplacereit beatsummary“one of the things we try very hard to do at berkshire is to stay within what i call our circle of competence warren buffettnever invest in a business you dont understand warren buffett“in the business world the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield” warren buffettwarren buffett famously said never invest in a business you dont understand thats one reason that i have never hit the buy button for northstar realty finance nrf im sure that the new yorkbased reit is a sound business but the complex structure seems to provide less transparency often distorting the true value of the company ill admit im not an expert when it comes to understanding nrf especially the various components of the reit  from spes vies pes cdos cmos and cmbs i provide explanations for these terms in my newsletter  it gets downright perplexing however i am intrigued with nrf and its diversified commercial real estate portfolio with  of total assets invested in real estate and  is invested in direct real estate investments in  the company generated  of total revenue from real estate and substantially all assets are invested in and revenues are generated from real estate excluding the european portfolio another famous line from warren buffett one of the things we try very hard to do at berkshire is to stay within what i call our circle of competence nrf is a seemingly complicated platform that invests in multiple asset classes across commercial real estate or cre the following table presents nrfs investments as of december   adjusted acquisitions and commitments to purchase real estate through february   on february   nrf announced that its board had approved a plan to spinoff the european real estate business into a newly formed publicly traded reit northstar realty europe corp nre expected to be listed on the new york stock exchange and potentially in europe european spin nre is expected to be completed in the second half of  as part of nrfs real estate strategy the reit explores a variety of real estate investments both directly and through joint ventures in order to purchase real estate bolstered by attractive returns i consider nrf somewhat of an incubator of sorts in which the company provides capital for a diverse platform utilizing equity and nonrecourse non marktomarket financing available through commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs and agency financing markets as i examine nrf as a potential investment i ask myself whether i would want to own an incubator or a reit that invests in a circle of competence its true that warren buffetts berkshire hathaway nysebrka nysebrkb is merely a collection of differentiated businesses that all enjoy circle of competence attributes but each of his businesses also have dedicated management so why wouldnt nrf qualify as a similar berkshire conglomerate that owns a variety of real estate sectors  each demonstrating a uniquely positioned value thesis external management doesnt excite me nrf is externally managed and the company has engaged northstar asset management group inc nsam to provide asset management and other services pursuant to a longterm management agreement and other ancillary agreements last year nsam spunoff from nrf the ability for nrf to achieve investment objectives and to make distributions to stockholders will depend in substantial part upon the performance of nsam and its ability to provide asset management and other services nrf pays nsam an annual base management fee regardless of the performance of the portfolio consequently nrf is required to pay nsam significant base management fees in a particular quarter despite experiencing a net loss or a decline in the value of its portfolio during that quarter also nsam has the ability to earn incentive fees each quarter based on nrfs cash available for distribution or cad which may create an incentive for nsam to invest in assets with higher yield potential which are generally riskier or more speculative or sell an asset prematurely for a gain and pay down borrowings in an effort to increase its shortterm net income and thereby increase the incentive fees to which it is entitled the compensation payable to nsam will increase as a result of future issuances of equity securities even if the issuances are dilutive to existing stockholders nrfs base management fee to nsam is equal to  per annum of the sum of source k • cumulative net proceeds of all future common equity and preferred equity issued by us • equity issued by us in exchange or conversion of exchangeable senior notes based on the stock price at the date of issuance • any other issuances by us of common equity preferred equity or other forms of equity including but not limited to limited partnership interests in an operating partnership excluding equitybased compensation but including issuances related to an acquisition investment joint venture or partnership and • our cumulative cad in excess of cumulative distributions paid on our common stock ltip units or other equity awards beginning the first full calendar quarter after the spinoff overview of northstars real estate nrfs portfolio is primarily comprised of healthcare hotel manufactured housing communities net lease multifamily properties and international real estate with a current focus on europe as of december   approximately  of nrfs real estate investments are concentrated in medical office buildings mobs and other healthcarerelated facilities following the completion of the acquisition of the griffinamerican portfolio nrf significantly increased its ownership of healthcare real estate properties in the portfolio nrfs healthcare portfolio is being run by james f flaherty iii who was previously the ceo of hcp inc nysehcp its worth noting that if flaherty were at hcp today he would be dealing with the difficulties associated with the hcr manorcare exposure it was flaherty who negotiated the hcr deal and now current ceo lauralee martin is having to manage the risks created by flaherty heres a snapshot of the nrf healthcare portfolio nrfs healthcare portfolio should generate around  million in noi in  its important to note that nrf outsources all of its asset management functions thats a key differentiator when you consider the fact that peers like healthcare trust of america nysehta are almost  internalized in its management services in other words i view nrf as an asset aggregator and not much of a risk manager ask yourself what you are actually getting when you invest in nrf nrfs second largest exposure is in the lodging sector recently the company entered into an agreement to acquire a  million hotel portfolio consisting of nine upscale extended stay and premium branded select service hotels containing over  rooms located in new england markets in new hampshire and massachusetts these new investments should produce positive earnings in the months ahead from the seasonality in nrfs  billion hotel portfolio nrf currently relies upon island to manage most of the hotels for this reason nrf is unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of the hotels such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates repositioning of a hotel food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters as a result nrf has limited recourse under its management agreements and the cash flow from the hotels may be affected adversely if managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name also because nrfs management agreements are longterm agreements they may not be able to terminate these agreements if the manager is not performing adequately nrfs manufactured housing business consists of  pad rental sites in  communities in  nrf is expected to generate around  million of noi from manufactured housing around  of noi is generated from pad rental sites nrfs fourth largest asset sector is triple net lease industrial office and retail that should generate a combined  million in noi in  it would be interesting to see if nrf looks to acquire any assets from american realty capital properties arcp also i would not be surprised to see nrf make a run to acquire cole capital from arcp that would provide nrf with a gateway to the net lease sector very quickly rounding out the assetlevel business nrf owns  multifamily units that should generate around  million of noi in  northstars european spin as of the end of the first quarter approximately  of nrfs  billion of total assets are directly or indirectly owned real estate or  if you exclude the european assets that will be spinning off in the european focused reit as illustrated below nrf has an extremely robust pipeline of attractive european real estate investment opportunities and nre will be very well positioned for future growth the spinoff of northstar realty europe is expected to be beneficial for northstar realty shareholders the spread between real estate yields and interest rates in europe is at historically wide levels recent quantitative easing measures announced by the european central bank are expected to drive spreads towards historical averages property price appreciation in the us has outpaced europe as market fundamentals bottomed and began to improve much earlier in us markets european real estate values are still well below the peak from last cycle the spinoff of northstar europe is expected to result in immediate value creation for northstar realty shareholders the  billion european real estate portfolio consists of  predominately office properties located across nine countries approximately  million square feet  occupied and weighted average remaining lease term of  years the european portfolio should generate around  million of noi in  northstars latest results nrfs results for the first quarter of  including cad cash available for distribution of  million or  per share cad is the best indicator of operating performance and is an important factor when evaluating our dividend in q nrfs investments totaled approximately  billion including assets of deconsolidated cdos and investments that northstar has either acquired or in contract to acquire subsequent to quarter end excluding the  billion portfolio expected to be contributed to the european spinoff total investments are approximately  billion nrf had approximately  billion of potential liquidity in q northstar is far from an intelligent reit alternative warren buffett said risk comes from not knowing what youre doing ill admit i now have a headache from researching nrf or maybe its because i have been in las vegas too long regardless i failed to mention that in addition to its real estate portfolio nrf derives other income from pe investments that own limited partnership interests in real estate private equity funds acquired in the secondary market managed by institutional quality sponsors the pe deals referred to as fund interests account for around  of nrfs assets  billion in  essentially nrf is what i would call a spread investor and unlike owning a dedicated reit that has an internalized management team nrf is much more a financial engineering operation for some investors nrf could be a good stock to own however to the less sophisticated investor like me there are many moving parts to consider with this security and i just dont see the value proposition  or the thrill of victory is not worth the agony of defeat take a look at the dividend history thats a good indicator that a value investor wouldnt own this stock but what about the market timers to be fair its important to understand that nrf has evolved from a mortgage reit to an equity reit effective december  and the over complex reit has just over a year under its belt in the equity reit space just last week the company announced it will be added to the msci us reit index effective at the close on may  as i ponder nrf  and its above average dividend yield of   i consider the closest peers the healthcare reits and the fact that these close cousins all have dedicated management teams so all they do is to go to work every day to create shareholder value these peers also have no conflicts of interest like nrf and all they do is invest in one asset class history has shown that owning a reit with dedicated management supported by a circle of competence will outperform perhaps a better option for global exposure will be nrfs spinoff reit in europe as david white wrote once companies are spunoff from their parents the newly traded entity can focus on growth and do whatever management thinks is in the right interest of the spinoff and its shareholders and not in the interest of the parent company the change in incentives can be a powerful catalyst for valuation growth over the last  months nrfs share price has performed well that doesnt mean its a good stock but long investors should be satisfied with the total return prospects its seems ironic perhaps that over the last  years the two worst performers were hcp and nrf as i mentioned hcp was previously led by the current ceo flaherty now vice chairman of the board of northstar healthcare income inc overseeing nrfs healthcare business furthermore i suggest that much of the decline in hcps share price was as a result of hcps previous management team and poor decision to invest in higher risk assets with an overweight exposure in hcr manorcare simply said i would not want to invest in a business where the coachs track record was subpar especially since a majority of nrfs revenue is derived from healthcare as warren buffett said in the business world the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield given the reasons noted  no circle of competence  no dedicated management team  externallyadvised and  unproven track record im not going to pursue the tempting yield associated with nrf im not comfortable with the alignment of interests and there are simply too many moving pieces nrf is a complex reit and even if i could begin to understand how all of the pieces of the puzzle are put together there is no way that i could ever sleep well at night i will be attending recon in las vegas today and i will not be able to reply to messages immediately if youre attending the conference tweet meswaninvestor
