research analyst growth at reasonable price consumer nondurablesa valuedriven bargain hunt summarylong island iced tea is a recent entrant in the beverage industrymanagement believes its claim on the long island iced tea name will help it forge a successful entry in rtd tea categoryhowever its registration of the generic term long island iced tea could still be challenged in courteven if the companys claim to ownership is successful it still faces an uphill struggle in competitive categorylong island iced tea ltea is an earlystage entrant in the american beverage industry the company’s revenues for its last fiscal year were very modest as it is still in the process of scaling its product distribution to a more significant number of retail doors since the beverage industry is notoriously crowded with both very wellestablished brands and numerous new introductions every year the company’s road to success is anything but certain its most significant product is focused on the rtd tea segment which is mature and dominated by incumbent brands like lipton brisk and arizona finding an area of unmet demand in a category as crowded as rtd tea therefore seems like a tough thing to do the brands that have in recent years found growth are overwhelmingly concentrated at the higher end of the category’s price range gold peak honest tea and fuze would be some examples of brands that have found a profitable niche in the marketplace and have been acquired by beverage giant cocacola nyseko as a way to complement its sodaheavy beverage portfolio meanwhile growth in the lower to midlevel price ranges which are dominated by arizona beverage and the pepsi nysepeplipton joint venture un has been more subdued cocacola has even decided to unwind its longstanding but notsosuccessful partnership with nestle otcpknsrgy regarding nestea which was something of an alsoran in this segment despite this the iced tea category has become a battleground for soda giants coke and pepsi both of which have large financial resources and marketing strength i expect this to intensify as soda beverages continue to experience declines in demand long island iced tea is positioned as a betterforyou alternative with a belowaverage price point in effect trying to tap into the higher growth segments by offering a value price this appears to be a somewhat conflicted brand message premium but not priced as such which in my opinion could create confusion among consumers despite the long odds long island is facing in the beverage marketplace the market is valuing this company at close to  million or about x trailing revenues the question is why long island’s marketing shortcut an important reason for long island’s optimistic valuation is that it appears to have found a smart way into the very crowded market for rtd teas through its successful registration of the name long island iced tea of course long island iced tea is a famous term for a cocktail containing among other things a number of spirits including vodka and tequila but no tea managements assumption is that the company can forego significant advertising expenditures to establish consumer recognition for its brand because the term long island iced tea is already wellrecognized among consumers in my opinion there are three significant problems with this assumption which cast doubt on the sustainability of the company’s current valuation the first problem is that long island iced tea is wellestablished as a hard drink which may give rise to confusion when a product carrying this name is found in the supermarket soft drink aisle the second issue is that name recognition in itself is not a guarantee for widespread adoption of a new product the idea that consumers will adopt long island iced tea purely because it sounds familiar is at best doubtful finally the companys registration of the long island iced tea trademark appears somewhat uncertain for instance the company has secured registration for the trademark under class  intended for nonalcoholic beverages in this case beverages based on tea but not for alcoholic beverages and more importantly the trademark has been added to the supplemental registry not the principal registry which among other things means it can still be contested in court by other parties if the company were to succeed in the marketplace i would expect competitors to raise objections over the company’s use of a generic term that has been in use since decades my suspicion is that the company is trying to establish a more credible claim to future use of the term potentially for alcoholic beverages by using its supplemental registration to bring products to market long island’s management may believe they will have a stronger claim to exclusive use of the name long island iced tea in the future if they have had a product named long island iced tea in the marketplace for a considerable time a competitive category the readytodrink tea segment is attractive both for its size and betterthanaverage growth rates but it is also crowded and significantly fragmented a short case study on recent attempts to penetrate the category might be useful to illustrate the longs odds long island is facing arguably one the most successful north american beverage companies of the past two decades has been monster beverage mnst which has managed to establish its monster energy brand as the most credible challenger to category creator red bull since launching in  the man credited with the creation of the monster energy brand is mark hall who prior to his move to then hansen natural worked for arizona beverages which is mostly known for its arizona iced tea brand one could make a credible case that monster energy is the most successful nonalcoholic beverage introduction in the american market of the past  years therefore mark hall has a significant amount of credibility as a marketing executive still his involvement at monster beverage has not prevented the company on numerous occasions of failing to gain traction with other beverage launches over the years monster beverage has launched such brands as hansen energy lost energy hitman energy shots and a rtd tea brand called peace tea and despite the fact that peace tea is still in existence as a brand owned by cocacola it has never had much of an impact on the rtd tea category monster’s executives mostly rodney sacks have in the past reflected on some of the reasons why the peace tea brand did not work as well as they had expected an important part of the explanation is related to the maturity of the rtd tea category which in the case of peace tea’s launch in  was at least several decades old upon category maturity a range of wellestablished brands have taken up a category’s allocated shelf space which makes it much harder to gain distribution especially in the smaller establishments prevalent in the convenience and gas channel within a price range the retailer usually stocks the category leader and perhaps a somewhat cheaper competitor convincing shop operators to reserve shelf space for an untested brand is usually very difficult unless it offers something unique a higher price point for a more premium product can be a way to secure shelf placement promising higher margins for the retailer in the process different product characteristics can be another way for instance a product with different ingredients flavors or packaging in long island iced tea’s case none of those seem to apply making it less likely that the brand will gain significant distribution another commonly employed way to gain distribution is to pay the retailers for shelf space also known as slotting fees this is a common way to gain premium shelf space but usually requires substantial financial investment without certainty of a payoff given long island’s modest financial means this method seems unlikely to serve as a successful tool for expanding distribution of its brand one could argue that peace tea was a fairly successful introduction by any normal standard just not when compared to monster energy it is true that peace tea grew into a brand of modest size certainly at a level that long island iced tea should be more than happy to achieve but there are more than a few differences between then hansen natural and long island iced tea not in the least the amount of executive talent mark hall had experience in running operations for one successful brand invented by others arizona and experience in launching and running operations for one very successful brand whose creation he oversaw monster on top of that hansen had the benefit of having substantial financial means by the time peace tea was launched existing distribution agreements with several strong partners including anheuser busch bud dr pepper dps and several cocacola ko bottlers and the credibility of already having established a very successful beverage brand peace tea’s problem in my opinion was not that it was illconceived or poorly executed but that it came very late to the game perhaps the brand was also not different enough from existing brands like arizona which made it even harder to gain shelf space when we look at long island iced tea it is obvious that the company does not have a highselling brand to spearhead its sales it does not have very substantial financial means and it does not have distribution agreements with powerful beverage distributors this leaves the company’s fortunes depending on the assumed recognition of the term long island iced tea and the beverage industry experience of its management team as widely touted in its financial documents but when we take a closer look at those beverage credentials it appears they are mostly related to the beer and spirits businesses which are entirely different product categories with a very different target consumer and product marketing this leaves ceo philip thomas and his cfo richard allen as the ones with the most experience in soft drinks in richard allen’s case the experience has been primarily in sales and financial functions with cadbury schweppes and snapple and in mr thomas’ case his beverage experience is limited to magnum vending which is his family’s vending machine business vending machine companies like magnum usually sell third party brands they are essentially a distribution business tailored to provide beverage distribution to offices and small retail accounts in other words the two key executives with soft drink experience appear to have very little experience with beverage branding and marketing conclusion the iced tea category is an attractive and growing segment but is also contested by a significant number of established players with very large resources in order to succeed as a newcomer you will need a differentiated product something that offers a better customer proposition from what is currently available in my opinion long island iced tea is not currently in possession of such an advantage it is true that the company is in the process of bringing other products to market like its long island lemonade line and its alo juice aloe vera drink but those may serve to diffuse management’s efforts to grow sales rather than enhance it in their latest annual filing the company also mentions its ambitions to enter the alcoholic beverage market at some point in the future it is possible that the company’s intention is to try to extend its trademark registration at some point to alcoholic beverages if they follow through on that ambition it would put the company in an atypical spot since most beverage companies are either focused on nonalcoholic or alcoholic beverages although i expect the company to continue growing from its currently very modest base i have some doubts regarding its potential to achieve profitability within a reasonable amount of time the company has a habit of frequently releasing information about newly signed distribution agreements but it is difficult to estimate the size of these accounts additionally a substantial amount of these agreements appear to involve the company’s gallon container products which as it has admitted carry very low or even negative margins “sales of our gallon containers have and continue to be sold below their cost in order to drive expanded distribution and brand visibility to consumers on retail store shelves” page  of the company’s latest k it is hard to see a viable business model in selling a product at a negative gross margin it would either imply that they expect to grow it into a profitable product line by expanding its scale and securing significant unit cost declines in the process or alternatively that they intend to use this product as a way of gaining distribution for their more profitable packages a potential problem with the second possibility is that retailers may never choose to stock the more profitable products finally and perhaps most importantly the uncertainty surrounding its claim to the exclusive use of the name long island iced tea casts doubt on the companys ability to secure brand ownership rights to this term combined with the long odds any new beverage entrant faces in the marketplace the overhang this uncertainty creates leads me to the conclusion that long island iced tea is not an attractive investment candidate i fully expect it to secure new distribution agreements with local beverage distributors as it has in the past but the path to a sufficiently large beverage brand that can deliver actual profits will be long and hard for me the odds for long island iced tea are simply too long this article is part of seeking alpha pro pro members receive exclusive access to seeking

iced tea stock brewing success  long island iced tea corp nasdaqltea  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»long island iced tea stock brewing successdec  about long island ltea investor initiatives long only growth special situations momentumsummarytop level management aggressively placing ltea productsfocused on becoming a nationwide brand in purchased alo juice brands to extend market reachwhile many small and emerging companies have tried to navigate their way into the multibillion dollar rtd beverage space only a tiny fraction have been able to advance significantly beyond their local grocery store a welcomed community gesture that can make a local flavor famous long island iced tea corp nasdaqltea on the other hand is an early and emerging success story that is brewing success on both a local and national level well on its way to becoming a stapled brand on the eastern corridor with a strategic vision to stake a national claim within the multibillion dollar beverage industry to capitalize upon these aggressive ambitions ltea is leveraging upon its professional expertise and by engineering multiple strategic and managerial initiatives that are designed to capture a sizable national footprint for its ready to drink tea and beverage products ltea the brand the first and perhaps the most important strategic accomplishment from a branding standpoint was to successfully trademark the iconic name long island iced tea no easy task by the way with legal teams working for over four years before being officially granted the exclusive rights and privilege to use the name the trademark allows for ltea to become the only ready to drink iced tea and beverage company to legally use in any nonalcoholic product mention the reference to long island iced tea while some may argue that a name is just that a name industry experts who have a keen sense of brand and market development will argue that ltea with this trademark has essentially been provided a tremendous shortcut to massive name and product recognition the first major hurdle for emerging retailers to clear the product name in and of itself has immediate name recognition on a national level allowing ltea to take advantage of a preconceived brand and to differentiate itself from a market that is becoming saturated with mimicked bottles and colorful but nonspecific labeling and design with the brand in place ltea then focused on assembling a top notch well respected management team that has demonstrated a history of generating market demand and product dominance in this competitive industry this was major accomplishment number two top management at ltea for those with entrepreneurial roots they know that building a brand from the ground up is no easy task typically ideas begin at the entrepreneurial level where they develop a product and plan intent on making it big in the marketplace from there they work hard to generate brand recognition and to generate product placements in as many locations as they can as fast as they can if successful in that regard the company success becomes so prolific that in more cases than not they can no longer keep pace with demand in a nutshell their success becomes their failure it happens more times than not with early stage projects despite the revenue and phenomenal product placement they ultimately crash and burn because they did not have the managerial infrastructure in place to direct the pace of growth and chart the proper strategic course this clearly is not the case at ltea senior management at ltea is comprised of a whos who of business talent combining over  years of beverage and consumer goods experience philip thomas ceo leads an all star cast of talent that features key industry figures from independent liquor snapple and cadbury schweppes arizona beverage and a coo who has over  years of experience in building iconic brands and developing products for keebler coca cola and thomas english muffins combined the management team at ltea is a powerhouse lineup each proficient at key and strategically important aspects of not only building the brand but having the capability to scale the business quickly and without the usual hiccups associated with brand development and segment penetration most any company would be happy to get just one leader of this caliber but ltea has gone a few steps further securing a vastly talented arsenal of experience setting ltea up for rapid growth in both the near and long term but lets face it a managerial team is a huge asset but if they dont have a great product to present to the market eventually the magic wand runs out of juice that wont be the case at ltea however ltea knocking down barriers its apparent that customers are showing a taste for ltea products evidenced by the extraordinary product trajectory that ltea is currently experiencing as stated earlier its relatively common for a local market to provide the first few product placements to maintain the community relationships however its quite a different story once the company moves outside of its hometown markets ltea has been on a swift pace in securing product placement with ltea products already available in over  states within the usa what makes the placement expansion that much more appreciable is that the ltea team has been successful in aggressively penetrating one of the most competitive markets in the food and beverage industry lteas ability to quickly and efficiently expand placements is where the strength and depth of management at ltea will continue to play a significant role as the company plans its  state rollout consumer demand is in place to support aggressive expansion by ltea the ready to drink tea segment rtd is expected to eclipse  billion by the year  with that market already significant it gets even larger when accounting for the steady change in consumer demand that is demonstrating a consistent shift in preference toward noncarbonated noncola style beverages industry estimates predict an approximate  rise in compounded annual growth for the rtd beverage category this market and its cumulative growth plays well into lteas strategy of securing a  market share in each of the product segments that they intend to serve this  share is already being realized in its existing market placements making the initial goal of  share in a national market quite achievable ltea has already placed the brand in over  food lion stores which will be stocking the shelves in december according to senior management the initial sale to food lion is the largest single sale in the companys history and sets the stage for exponential growth in the coming earnings reports that are filed with the sec on a quarterly basis the food lion sale alone will send revenues soaring year over year however with the company aggressively building relationships for a quick surge in placements ltea may very well be on the verge of announcing several strategic developments in the near future the ltea difference ultimately product makes the difference hence having a great product can make a great difference ltea is well aware of that concept which is perhaps why the company is focused on using only top quality ingredients in all of its beverages ltea uses only real cane sugar nongmo products and includes no artificial additives of any kind in its formulations additionally for its diet beverage alternatives ltea uses a splenda based sweetener standing clear from aspartame and its increasing decline in consumer preference utilizing the best ingredients and remaining focused on product freshness and regional accessibility ltea clearly understands the market well enough to develop the best products to place in specific markets and regions throughout the country for instance although it may seem obvious ltea management is focused on ensuring that a consumer gets what they desire they understand that from a quality standpoint when serving a customer who desires a sweet beverage then by all means give them the best option clean and delicious pure cane sugar isnt it ironic that within a multibillion dollar industry many rtd company executives still take the consumers preference for granted and continue to concoct formulations that are full of chemicals and artificial sweeteners these execs are clearly ignoring the trends and shift in taste not true at ltea management clearly recognizes the shift and is addressing the changes head on to meet both changing demand and consumer preference i dont mean to belittle the senior management that will be competing against the ltea product line but it just seems that the longer some of these guys stay in place the less creative they become maybe that lends good reason as to why ltea has been able to assemble the caliber of talent that it has being committed to meeting and exceeding customer demand without the need to save a few pennies as an obstacle even the slim oz bottle tells a story of distinction with a beverage market now saturated with either the generic vitawater bottle or the flimsy bottled water replica ltea has designed a unique bottle design that offers ease in handling and provides easy consumption while on the move lets face it most people are on the go these days and they eat and drink on the fly creating a package design is about more than good looks it needs to offer form and function that is suitable to the product and i believe that the ltea team has hit a home run on both fronts these guys recognized some design issues early on during the development phase of the brand and undertook an extensive evaluation process to design and implement its new labeling and packaging designs in  the labels are crisp and fresh promoting healthy images and vibrant colors that promote a healthy and natural image for the product the fantastic part of the new labeling and design is that it can have a global reach with easily understood graphics and symbols of quality global reach for ltea since i touched on global its fitting that i mention the fact that ltea recently purchased alo juice brands in an all stock earn out deal ltea will be relying on the expertise of julio ponce who will serve as the vp of southeast and latin american sales while alo juice is clearly a popular beverage that is gaining momentum throughout the united states the primary target market for ltea as it begins its aggressive roll out will target the latin customer embarking on a mission to seize upon a revenue target of between  million and  million for the alo and ltea beverages in that region alone if that primary sales goal were reached it would represent an increase of over  from total company sales in  alone and when the additional counts are tallied from the remaining regions throughout the country the growth rate for ltea can be extremely impressive talking about growth is just chatter but ltea has the distribution channels to back up the rhetoric ltea has product or near product placements with food lion menards acme ingles and supermax just to name a few in the us market from its foreign interests and channels it utilizes the agreements and distribution channels built through unique foods in canada tres mojitas in puerto rico and has similar arrangements for product distribution in bermuda and honduras the good news in all of these channels is that ltea is just now becoming aggressive in taking advantage of every inch of shelf space available that makes both economic and strategic sense to develop thus the growth in these markets is not anywhere near being fully matured national and global reach brews revenue from the revenue perspective ltea is delivering exceptional growth since the company formally launched its product sales in  ltea has generated yearoveryear growth in excess of  as of the q of  this takes into account the seasonal fluctuations within the rtd tea segment yet at the end of the day the trend line is strong and is clearly moving from the lower left corner of the chart higher to the top right corner and with the company poised to add additional product placement in the coming weeks and months the chart may have a blow out to the upside once the company is able to report the progress with just under  million shares outstanding it wont take much in the way of buying pressure to drive the current  per share price substantially higher take into consideration the  billion all cash deal that dr pepper snapple nysedps paid to bai brands providing a x multiple to expected  revenues that deal was backed up by another high multiple deal when pepsi nysepep paid kevita roughly  million to take over its  million company providing them with a x price against revenue these deals demonstrate two things first the market is still hungry for acquisition targets and two the multiples being paid are quite healthy if we look at these two case studies as examples ltea is already trading under its relative value if it was to be acquired today however if the projected revenue of between  million is reached by ltea within the next two years the share price becomes grossly undervalued ltea making its presence known already ltea is making its presence known in several local markets in the eastern region commanding a  market share in the chain stores that currently market the ltea brands suggesting that the ltea team can continue to generate the same  market share which is its shortterm goal ltea can generate revenue in excess of over  million in the us alone and over  million on a global scale then provide the x multiple if a suitor came hopping toward ltea headquarters and the price tag for the company could well exceed  per share these hypotheticals are based on a  market share of the  billion market listen this is not a pie in the sky number ltea is generating both sales and momentum then once that momentum is coupled with a seasoned and deeply experienced management team the goal of meeting a  penetration rate is a very manageable goal my analysis leads me to believe that no member of this management team would be willing to make a career move that brings with it the potential for years of development processes and trial and error placement decisions ltea management came together on this venture because they have a fantastic product with exceptional growth potential for worldwide development acquisition and licensing deals for several of its unique brands the immediate potential for ltea is to take advantage of the low hanging fruit that being the rtd tea and alo beverages beyond that i expect that the company will further advance its product lineup to include alcoholic beverages in their product mix within the next twelve to eighteen months that figure alone based on industry estimates of over  billion a year in ready to drink sales can undoubtedly add explosive revenue to an already blossoming revenue base while the addition of alcoholic beverages may not be too far down the road investors should clearly focus on the undervalued proposition that ltea offers investors at these current levels then consider the addition of alcohol based products a windfall until i see a reason to expect otherwise i am giving this seasoned team more than the benefit of the doubt that they will be successful on targeted strategic fronts and will deliver substantial shareholder value to investors while no investment should be made with the expectation that shortterm results will lead to an overnight run in the stock price investors should be aware that ltea has such a tiny public float of shares that if ltea does surprise on an earnings front the laws of supply and demand can easily take the stock price significantly higher and if investors focus on a x revenue multiple that has been paid to two similar companies in  they can remain grounded to what an appropriate valuation may be and react to trading that provides either under or over valuations hence if ltea delivers revenue results in excess of  million in  and can maintain its outstanding share count at  million shares or less ltea should be able to almost double in price from its current level however if management executes on their aggressive placement strategy the revenue numbers can far exceed the  million full year  target that i believe ltea can already reach investors need to stay focused as to what is transpiring at the company headquarters and should pay close attention to revenue reports forward guidance and additional vendor relationships that i believe may soon be announced although i only know as much as the next shrewd investor i know a little about reading between the lines and doing the diligence required to catch a rising star before it makes it to full orbit with ltea having an outstanding product line boosted by a significantly talented management team that has proven their ability to get things done on schedule the window for investors to catch ltea at these levels may soon be closing from the public documents that i have read i expect some significant announcements within the next three to six weeks ones that will demonstrate the power and capability of both brand and management and if i am correct in my prognostications ltea investors may fare very well in the near to medium term disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions
