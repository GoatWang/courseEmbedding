annyswapo he was an insider who nearly everyone could line up behind known for his long tenure and big ideas the appointment of longtime university of virginia dean carl p zeithaml on tuesday as the school’s interim president surprised many inside and outside the university but those familiar with zeithaml including rivals at other schools say the yearold strategic management expert is wellequipped to step in and lead a campus that is still reeling from the abrupt ouster of his predecessor teresa a sullivan sullivan resigned june  after two years on the job citing “a philosophical difference of opinion” with some members of the school’s board of visitors rector helen e dragas had criticized sullivan for moving too slowly to address “an existential threat” facing the university as a result of the sluggish economy and declining state support in contrast to sullivan who had no prior ties to the university zeithaml is well known to faculty administrators and governing board members he came to charlottesville in  to become dean of the mcintire school of commerce the university’s undergraduate business program a job he still holds he is one of the the longestserving deans at uva during his tenure he has made a name for himself as an innovator and someone who has tackled ­everpresent funding challenges by creating new programs one of his earliest and bestknown accomplishments was a makeover of the undergraduate business curriculum he put more emphasis on realworld experiences having students work in teams on problems facing actual businesses and make presentations to corporate executives that approach helped mcintire land at the top of businessweek’s rankings of undergraduate business programs which began in  last year mcintire was ranked second after the university of notre dame it has also occupied the top spot in the past “he was critical in moving mcintire up the rankings” said norean sharpe undergraduate dean of the mcdonough school of business at georgetown university which was th last year in the businessweek rankings sharpe earned a doctorate at uva and her daughter recently received a masters in commerce from mcintire one of several new degree programs zeithaml helped create that have brought in revenue for the school to help finance some of mcintire’s core undergraduate classes zeithaml helped line up corporate sponsors such as rollsroyce and major league baseball he is also known as a prolific fundraiser a skill some governing board members found lacking in sullivan he helped secure funding for mcintire’s current home a  million stateoftheart addition that opened in  the board’s handling of sullivan’s departure sparked protests on campus and angered the faculty senate which in turn called for dragas and several other board members to resign vice rector mark kington an alexandria businessman who was a key player in sullivan’s ouster stepped down yesterday many in charlottesville see zeithaml’s selection as an attempt by the board to restore a sense of stability after a week of tumult his term as interim president is slated to begin aug  zeithaml who is married and lives in charlottesville was traveling tuesday and not available for comment in a university news release he said “i realize that it is a very difficult time for many people within our community but i look forward to working with our faculty students staff alumni and university leaders to move uva forward” zeithaml’s most recent feat of financial engineering was persuading the administration to charge mcintire students a few thousand dollars a year more a practice known as “differential tuition” the higher cost has not hurt demand applications are up said jim travisano mcintire’s assistant dean of communications zeithaml is known as someone who doesn’t forget a name and who is good at getting people to work together sharpe said in her encounters with him he has been open and willing to share strengths and weaknesses of programs a quality she said has likely helped him hold the same job for so long being dean of a undergraduate business program sharpe said “is very stressful very hard and very political” “he is a very savvy strategist” said mcintire senior associate dean richard netemeyer prior to his appointment yesterday zeithaml had never expressed interest in the job of uva president colleagues said nor has he said he wants the job permanently it is unclear how many contenders there were for interim president the board spoke with edward miller the dean and chief executive of the medical faculty at johns hopkins according to the baltimore sun it appointed zeithaml after  hours of closeddoor meetings he won the vote of every member but one heywood fralin who said in a statement released tuesday that his vote had ”nothing to do with my opinion of carl zeithaml’s leadership abilities” having served on two search committees with zeithaml fralin said he regards him as “an extraordinary and capable leader” and that his vote was an indication of his “dissatisfaction with the process and the decision that lead to the resignation of terry sullivan” zeithaml came to uva after  years at the kenanflagler business school of the university of north carolina at chapel hill he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from the university of notre dame and holds degrees from
