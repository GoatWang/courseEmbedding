highlighting potential valuecreating initiatives and concerns about company’s valuation february    am eastern standard time san francisco  new yorkbusiness wiremarcato capital management llc “marcato” and oskie capital management llc “oskie” together with their affiliated investment funds “the group” announced today that they have sent a letter to the board of directors of lear corporation nyse lea “lear” or “the company” outlining concerns around the company’s valuation describing the group’s ideas for potential valuecreating initiatives and reiterating the group’s interest in meeting with members of the board the full text of the letter follows marcato capital management llc one montgomery street suite  san francisco ca  telephone number        oskie capital management llc  east rd street st floor new york ny  telephone number    february   mr henry wallace chairman of the board mr matthew j simoncini president chief executive officer and director mr thomas p capo  nominating and corporate governance committee chairman mr jonathan f foster ms kathleen a ligocki mr conrad l mallett jr compensation committee chairman mr donald l runkle mr gregory c smith audit committee chairman co lear corporation  telegraph road southfield mi    dear members of the board of directors investment funds affiliated with marcato capital management and oskie capital management are significant stockholders of lear corporation the “company” with holdings together representing beneficial ownership of approximately  percent of lear’s outstanding common equity we share the view expressed in the company’s press release of february   that the company is undervalued and we see what we believe to be a serious discrepancy between lear’s improved operating performance and business prospects and its current market valuation it is our view that this discount is directly linked to a questionable capital allocation strategy by the board specifically we believe the company’s current undervaluation reflects investors’ distaste for the company’s practice of stockpiling an increasing net cash balance along with concern that the company may be willing to make costly acquisitions or invest in other lowreturn projects at a time when the repurchase of lear’s undervalued stock would be far more accretive to the longterm equity value of the company it is therefore no surprise to us that lear’s stock is trading both at a significant discount to its peers and well below its longrun historical multiple of x ebitda it is our contention that the company’s recent announcement – to accelerate the pace of its existing stock repurchase program and raise its dividend – is insufficient simply put we view lear as dramatically overcapitalized with net cash of almost x ebitda we believe lear is approximately x full turns of leverage below the average of a group of its peers – despite lear’s lower capital intensity better pension liability position favorable tax advantages and higher free cash flow conversion further lear’s large cash balance has the effect we believe of increasing the company’s equity value thereby artificially inflating the company’s pe multiple and distorting the value of the core enterprise the board’s choices regarding capital allocation appear parsimonious and are even more disappointing in light of the positive operational progress the management team has made during and since emerging from chapter  reorganization the company is now more diversified by geographical endmarket and customer mix and with its strong competitive position in its core seating business and a lower fixed cost base we believe the company is well positioned to generate significantly improved margins for a given level of production we note that the board has de minimis ownership of the company’s shares all of this gives us serious concerns about the current board’s sense of urgency and alignment of interests with the company’s owners we are aware that our concerns are shared by a number of other large stockholders and are of the impression that there has been little action taken despite these concerns having been voiced directly to members of the board on multiple occasions in the past accordingly we believe that it is important to add new board members who will bring focus and urgency to the implementation of potential valuecreating initiatives including the immediate commencement of a  billion share repurchase program to both take advantage of the current valuation discount and establish a more appropriate capital structure inline with other prudently capitalized industry participants and a review of the company’s growth capital expenditure budget and acquisition and divestiture strategy to ensure that stockholder capital is being directed to those areas that offer the highest possible longterm return we reiterate that we are interested in having a constructive dialogue with mr wallace mr simoncini and the other directors
