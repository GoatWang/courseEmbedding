albert albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp thank you ben good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our earnings call to discuss our first quarter results in this mornings press release we reported quarterly net income of  million or  per diluted share on net sales of  billion our first quarter results are a record for sales of  billion and ebitda of  million and reflect the strength of our business which benefited from improving economic conditions the first quarter saw higher sales prices for our products which follow improving demand that reflects the strengthening of global economies we are pleased with our first quarter results despite the impact of the planned turnaround at our calvert city kentucky vinyls facility the geismar louisiana chloralkali plant other planned outages and integrationrelated items during the quarter we performed maintenance work on a number of our plants to improve operational performance and started the expansion work in our calvert city ethylene plant that along with other incremental projects added  million pounds of ethylene production capacity which we recently completed in april this expansion utilizes lowcost ethane feedstock from the marcellus shale basin thanks to the ongoing dedication and efforts of our employees we continued to make good progress in our axiall integration and remain on track to capture the  million of synergies and cost savings this year that we have previously communicated our operational performance program that was launched after we closed the transaction in august of  to review the axiall assets and identify areas for operational improvements is well underway we are already seeing the benefit from these efforts we continue to focus on improving the safe and reliable performance of our assets and derive the value from these efforts i would now like to turn our call over to steve to provide more detail on the financial and operating results mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp albert and good morning everyone i will start with discussing our consolidated financial results followed by a detailed review of our olefins and vinyls segment results let me begin with our consolidated results this morning westlake reported net income for the first quarter of  of  million or  per diluted share on net sales of  billion our first quarter results were higher compared to the first quarter  due to higher sales prices for our major products resulting in improved margins and from earnings contributed from axiall first quarter results benefited from a lower quarterly effective tax rate that was primarily due to a nonrecurring adjustment of  million or  per diluted share and a lower estimated annual tax rate for  as compared to the prior year the first quarter results also included pretax unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other costs associated with the turnaround and expansion of the calvert city ethylene unit and other planned turnarounds and unplanned outages totaling approximately  million or  per diluted share the lost sales associated with these turnarounds of approximately  million pretax or  per diluted share and pretax transaction and integratedrelated costs of approximately  million for  per diluted share associated with the acquisition first quarter  net sales of  billion were driven by sales contributed by axiall and higher sales prices for all of our major products operating income of  million for the first quarter of  also benefited from higher sales prices for all of our major products which resulted in higher integrated product margins and from the earnings contributed following the axiall acquisition this was primarily offset by unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other cost and lost sales associated with the turnaround expansion of our calvert city ethylene unit and other planned turnaround and unplanned outages that took place in the first quarter of  which totaled to the  million that i previously mentioned compared to the same period last year we saw improved operating performance in the first quarter from our acquired assets as our recent investments to address previously deferred maintenance are already delivering higher operating rates and improved reliability compared to the fourth quarter of  sales revenue in the first quarter of  of  billion and income from operations of  million both increased first quarter  sales benefited from higher sales volumes for all of our major products and higher sales prices for caustic and north american pvc resin the improvement in operating income was due to increased sales volumes for all of our major products higher olefins and vinyls integrated margins and lower integration costs as compared to the prior quarter our utilization of a fifo method of accounting resulted in a favorable impact of approximately  million pretax or  per share in the first quarter compared to what earnings would have been reported on the lifo method this calculation is only an estimate and has not been audited now lets move on to review the performance of our two segments starting with our olefins segment in the first quarter of  the olefins segment reported operating income of  million on net sales of  million net sales increased from the first quarter  as we saw sales prices for our major products improve along with sales volumes for polyethylene and ethylene operating income also increased over the same period driven by higher olefins integrated product margins following the increase in sales prices for our major products and higher polyethylene and ethylene sales volumes partially offset by higher feedstock and energy prices compared to the fourth quarter first quarter net sales and income from operations both increased the improved results followed the increase in average sales prices and from higher polyethylene and styrene sales volumes partially offset by higher feedstock and energy cost now moving on to the vinyls segment the vinyls segment reported operating income of  million in the first quarter of  and net sales of  billion both which improved as compared to the first quarter of  net sales increased due to sales contributed by axiall higher sales prices for pvc resin higher caustic and building products sales volumes and higher european sales prices for pvc resin and caustic soda the improvement in operating income was a result of higher pvc sales prices and earnings contributed by axiall these increases were partially offset by the lower production rates and costs associated with the calvert city planned turnaround and expansion and other planned turnarounds by higher feedstock and energy prices during the current quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of  operating income improved by  million while sales improved by  million the improved results were driven by higher sales volumes from all of our major products and higher caustic and pvc sales prices partially offset by higher energy costs the first quarter  was negatively impacted by the planned turnarounds and expansion of our calvert city ethylene unit and other planned turnarounds while the fourth quarter  was negatively impacted by the planned turnaround of our lake charles vinyls chloralkali unit and other planned turnarounds and unplanned outages the first quarter  also benefited from lower integrationrelated expenses compared to the prior quarter now lets turn our attention to our balance sheet and cash flow for the first quarter of  cash generated from operating activities was  million and we invested  million in capital expenditures at the end of the first quarter we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  million and our total debt was approximately  billion we will continue to prudently manage our balance sheet and continue our planned investments to address deferred maintenance now allow me to provide some updated guidance for modeling purposes we will continue our efforts that began last year to improve our operational performance our current maintenance plan includes several planned outages that will impact our second quarter earnings by approximately  million this number reflects the higher maintenance expenses that will be incurred for these outages along with the associated lost sales also note that the second quarter guidance includes the impact from a recently completed calvert city ethylene unit expansion and turnaround in the second half of the year we expect an impact of  million as we continue our maintenance effort to improve reliability and performance we will continue to assess our planned turnarounds and maintenance activity and we will provide more guidance on our next earnings call moving on to capital spending our current estimate for  capital expenditures remains in the range of  million to  million this includes capital for our calvert city ethylene unit expansion that we recently completed and also includes our investment in the lotte ethylene joint venture these capital and maintenance investments improve our reliability and competitiveness of our plants we estimate that our  effective annual tax rate for the year will be approximately  and our cash tax rate will be approximately  we are on track to capture the synergies and cost savings of  million that we previously announced and remain on track to capture approximately  million of these savings this year while expensing around  million to achieve these savings with that ill turn the call back over to albert to make some closing comments albert albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp thank you steve we saw improving fundamentals in the first quarter as we benefited from higher sales prices and integrated product margins along with solid demand for our end products we continue to focus on capturing synergies related to our axiall acquisition and are investing to improve the operational reliability and competitiveness of our assets looking further into  we expect to see greater ethylene availability as the new ethylene plant starts up and capacity expansions are completed to take advantage of the lowcost north american shalebased oil and gas production we also see favorable underlying demand trends continuing through  for all of our major products including chloralkali we are seeing some chloralkali capacity reductions in north america and there have been no new plans announced additionally the european regulatory authorities have mandated that mercurybased chlorine production must shut down or convert to another technology by the end of the year which will lead to capacity reduction in the region we believe that westlake is well positioned to benefit from these market developments the first quarter marked an important milestone in our efforts to improve the plants reliability performance and competitiveness of our recently acquired assets we still have work ahead of us in  and we have a strong management team in place to deliver the improvements to our operations that will drive growth in our bottom line thank you very much for listening to our earnings call this morning now i will turn the call back over to ben l benjamin ederington  westlake chemical corp thank you albert before we begin taking questions i would like to remind you that a replay of the teleconference will be available starting two hours after we conclude the call we will provide that number again at the end of the call operator we will now take questions questionandanswer session operator and the first question comes from the line of aleksey yefremov from nomura instinet your line is now open matthew s skowronski  nomura instinet morning this is matt skowronski on for aleksey today albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp good morning mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp good morning matthew s skowronski  nomura instinet was your planned threeweek shutdown of calvert city completed in the first quarter or did this extend at all into the second quarter mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp it moved to the middle of the nd of april matthew s skowronski  nomura instinet okay all right and then can you describe what your expectations are for styrene pricing for the rest of the year albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp well as you know the styrene price has benefited from some of the strong demand and supply issues around the world and since then benzene prices has come down and styrene prices has also dropped from its high if youre looking at cdis forecast that theyre looking at styrene prices to remain in this range for the rest of the year maybe a little bit higher than the april price but i think the rest of the year looks like pretty much flat in the area matthew s skowronski  nomura instinet thank you albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre welcome operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of don carson from susquehanna financial your line is now open don carson  susquehanna financial group lllp thank you a question on your deferred maintenance and other spending so steve it looks like its not up that much sort of totals up to  million despite â i would have thought that your lost volumes would have cost you more with the increase in prices that weve seen in the marketplace mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp well don we attempted to give as good an estimate as we could and youre right the increase was close to our estimate of  million for the first quarter came in at  million don carson  susquehanna financial group lllp okay and a question on pricing realization so we saw the march caustic index up  april up  two questions how long does it take you to realize those index increases and how much of your business is tied to indexes now versus how much is nonindex albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp index is a small portion of our business even though it plays an important position in the industry don carson  susquehanna financial group lllp so you should see some fairly meaningful caustic increases in q then albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp yeah we would expect to have â yes mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp thats right don carson  susquehanna financial group lllp okay thank you albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre welcome operator and our next question comes from the line of kevin mccarthy from vertical research your line is now open kevin w mccarthy  vertical research partners yes good morning albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp good morning mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp good morning kevin w mccarthy  vertical research partners weve seen lumber prices increased quite a bit in response to the tariff increase proposals do you expect that to have any impact on pvc resin or building materials either in the us or canada moving forward albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp certainly they will have some advantage as you know most of the pvc goes into the pipe area which lumber would not have impact but on pvc sidings they do compete with lumber and i think now is the season that building constructions going into higher gear with the improving weather so we will see that some of the resin price increases in pvc will pass through more easily into the sidings area kevin w mccarthy  vertical research partners i see and then second question if i may we saw the williams cracker trade since your last conference call what are your thoughts on that particular deal as well as your own short position in ethylene monomer and any options that you see ahead to bridge that gap albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp sure i think the fact that foreign investors are investing in the us ethylene plants at a reasonable price indicates that peoples confidence the us feedstock supply will be adequate and at a good competitive price compared to rest of world so i think its very positive for the us ethylene industry kevin w mccarthy  vertical research partners thank you very much albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre welcome operator and our next question comes from the line of pj juvekar from citi your line is now open pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc yes hi good morning over the last few years axiall and other industry players never made money on caustic with the jump in the export market so as the industry consolidates do you think north american players are looking at caustic differently and they can make money on both sides of the molecule namely chlorine and caustic albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp yeah thats a good question pj i think in the past with the slow global economy growth and with excess capacity in the world the caustic business has not been doing well but since then the economy globally has improved theres been capacity reductions in europe and in us and i think with no new additional capacity being announced in the us or most of the world and with the chinese environmental enforcement i think that dampens supply and demands still growing so we believe that margin will improve in the coming years pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc thank you and as you analyze axiall assets and look at their profitability plant by plant are there any assets that you think you can shut down such as their natrium plant which as we know has been high cost plant albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp certainly as we mentioned earlier we have been reviewing all our assets that weve acquired and the number one goal is to see whether we can improve the facilities and if the investment is not justified then well look at alternatives we did shut down a pvc pipe plant that we acquired from axiall that was not economical to run so we are looking at all the assets very carefully but our primary goal is to see whether we can improve the operations of the plants pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc thank you albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre welcome operator and our next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets your line is now open arun viswanathan  rbc capital markets llc great thanks just wanted to understand some of your expectations on price realization so in pvc what do you guys expect i guess as far as price and margin for q and the rest of  albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp certainly pvc as you know price went up  in february additional  in march and on the table theres another  for april price increase so sometimes large buyers have day price protection so we didnt get the full benefit in the first quarter and the price increases will carry over into the second quarter to get a full benefit and looking forward at least for the next few months at least the industry analysts are not seeing any price reductions in the next few months arun viswanathan  rbc capital markets llc okay great thats helpful and then similarly in polyethylene there was a  increase in february  in march looks like the  for aprils been pushed to may were also seeing some declines in the spot market are you seeing those as well and how do you expect polyethylene pricing and margin to play out for the rest of this year albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp yes certainly yes we did implement the  a pound in february and  a pound in march and the additional  for aprils been pushed to may we are getting the price increase as said other than contractual day price protection so i think second quarter well see the full benefit of price increases the export market price is very high sometimes higher than the domestic market but as the export market has adjusted it has come down so the spot prices reflected some reductions but again looking forward people dont expect the next several months with any price reductions arun viswanathan  rbc capital markets llc and then just lastly on the axiall integration you called out some expenses to get the savings would you characterize the integration going kind of in line with your expectations or better and do you ultimately see any upside to your synergy expectations thanks albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp yes the integration is moving as planned and certainly we are looking at more synergies and costdowns that we had announced before and our management team as well as the whole westlake company team are looking at all the ways to find further improvements so we will inform investors as we progress but its going quite smoothly arun viswanathan  rbc capital markets llc great thanks albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre welcome operator and your next question comes from the line of robert koort from goldman sachs your line is now open ryan berney  goldman sachs  co good morning this is ryan berney on for bob just wanted to ask albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp morning ryan berney  goldman sachs  co around the margins in the olefins segment seems like they were quite strong this quarter especially relative to the top line number you put up which came up but not quite as much so i was hoping you could give us a sense for if there were any special items in there i know you called out a few things but within that olefins piece that you could put some clarity around â especially relative to some of your competitors who are part of the cycle those margins seemed pretty strong mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp no there isnt anything that i would call out ryan that was unusual in that olefins segment the special item and all i think as albert outlined earlier the price increases that were announced and put in well get the full benefit of that in q but there was nothing unusual that i would call out in our olefins or polyolefins pieces of the business ryan berney  goldman sachs  co great thanks and then i was hoping you could provide an update on kind of the axiall cost side and whether or not youve â could take the opportunity to update your guidance around the combined cost savings and the synergies there mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp the synergy number that we expect to achieve this year still remains on track at  million that we believe it will achieve this year and i gave some guidance in terms of how much we thought wed spend this year we think the expenditure will be about  million to achieve that  million and so were still very much on track to achieve the total of  million a year and of course as albert said were looking for opportunities to find synergies beyond that and once we find those and achieve those well talk about those and explain where those are coming from ryan berney  goldman sachs  co thank you very much albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre welcome unknown speaker you didnt see my note to you earlier mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp im sorry ryan ryan berney  goldman sachs  co i said thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank your line is now open david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc thanks albert could you discuss how you see new polyethylene supply coming in to the market this year and how it might impact your business and any impact at all do you think on your ldpe business over the course of the next year or so albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp certainly yes certainly these plants coming on stream are ldpe linear low or high density they are large scale â worldscale plants theyre probably making more commodity grades and probably targeting more the export market since u s is exporting already about  of its polyethylene production westlake trying to focus more on the specialty side of the polyethylene businesses and as you know our ldpe  is autoclave and the us capacity being added are all tubular ldpe technology which is somewhat different from autoclave process so david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc  albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp go ahead please david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc and just out of curiosity in calvert city what do you pay for ethane how much of a discount versus gulf coast prices albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp certainly ethane we purchase comes from the marcellus utica area and our prices is marketrelated david i begleiter  deutsche bank securities inc thank you albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre welcome operator and our next question comes from the line of john roberts from ubs your line is now open john roberts  ubs securities llc thank you nice quarter guys albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp thank you john john roberts  ubs securities llc while ethane has been a more competitive feed more often than not propane has actually become competitive on occasion especially because of propylene coproduct credit did you retain flexibility to go back towards more propane at calvert city and would you even ever consider that given your now short ethylene because of the axiall transaction albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp certainly yes calvert city still has the ability to go back to propane and so is our lake charles petro ii but if we went back to propane well have to produce less ethylene and as you said we are ethylene short so netnet even though maybe propane cracking may be at times a few cents better but the fact that the ethylene volume penalty would not justify running propane for us john roberts  ubs securities llc great and just a followup question as you review the axiall assets and i know youre looking to improve there they were noncore assets for ppg at least part of them were and then axiall was capitalconstrained so i would guess that theres some unexploited debottleneck opportunities at either ppg and then axiall as a subsequent owner just didnt want to put capital towards â or couldnt put capital towards have you come across any yet or its still too early to think about debottlenecks albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp certainly with our improvement programs at all the plants we are identifying areas for debottleneck as well as just reliability improvements that will also increase production so were evaluating all the above and as you said the more work we do we identify more opportunities john roberts  ubs securities llc okay thank you albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre welcome operator and your next question comes from the line of hassan ahmed from alembic global your line is now open hassan i ahmed  alembic global advisors llc good morning albert and steve albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp good morning mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp good morning hassan hassan i ahmed  alembic global advisors llc albert youve talked about curtailment on capacity closures and the like in the chloralkali side of things partly in north america obviously driven by regulation out in europe question is that on the nearer term side of things because obviously you flagged these regulations kicking in by end  so my question is around the pace of these closures are you seeing a deceleration over the next couple of quarters in terms of the pace of these capacity shutdowns or is it the opposite albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp yeah in the european side i think people who are converting are already in progress to convert them those people who plan to shut down theyll run their plants through the end of the year before they have to shut down and those people who are shutting down either they shut down their derivative plants or they are in the process of lining up feedstock supplies for their derivative plants from other sources so all these activities are going on hassan i ahmed  alembic global advisors llc got it got it thanks so much for that and as a followup albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre welcome hassan i ahmed  alembic global advisors llc revisiting one of the questions that was asked earlier about the williamsnova transaction as i sort of ran my numbers on a replacement value basis it seems that those assets were sold at over  a pound so with i would imagine the engineering and construction or the ec market sort of flattening now obviously you guys are sort of building out your cracker with lotte as well how does that valuation stack up to a new greenfield build in a flattening ec market in your mind albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp thats a good question as you know that some company have announced completion of their plants â of new ethylene plant like oxy i think its well over  a pound and certainly in the lotte joint venture they have publicly announced this  billion project for a  billion pounds plant now its yet to be finished so we dont know what the final cost will be and you have certainly exxon chevron dows and sasols plants and so they are all over the place but those are new plants worldscale and the williams plants are older plants and â its still pretty big close to worldscale plants so its hard to say if this is priced high or low but the fact that nova and certainly its parents ipic is investing sizable money in the us which again reconfirms the competitiveness of us ethylene facility and manufacturing for the long term into the future hassan i ahmed  alembic global advisors llc very good thanks so much albert albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre very welcome hassan operator and our next question comes from the line of james sheehan from suntrust robinson humphrey your line is now open james sheehan  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you you mentioned some of your axiall facilities you were able to increase the operating rates that legacy axiall had run at can you comment on where you see the axiall operating rates today albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp yes as we mentioned earlier the production improvement program has been going on some started before we acquired the assets and some started after we acquired the assets and we are seeing those efforts been bearing fruit and we do have turnarounds going on in the first quarter and in second quarter but by and large i think our plants are improving better than in the past james sheehan  suntrust robinson humphrey inc are the axiall facilities running at the same utilization as legacy westlake facilities albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp yes some has done well and some are still ongoing under the performance improvement programs so depend on the plants but by and large things are doing better than the past james sheehan  suntrust robinson humphrey inc all right thank you albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre welcome operator and our next question comes from the line of frank mitsch from wells fargo securities your line is now open frank j mitsch  wells fargo securities llc hey good morning if i could just follow up on that last question albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp good morning frank frank j mitsch  wells fargo securities llc hey albert if i could just followup on that last question are you seeing the better performance out of chloralkali or is it more in the vc and pvc side of things with the axiall assets albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp its throughout all the assets frank j mitsch  wells fargo securities llc across the board youve seen improving in terms of operating rates and reliability albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp yes frank frank j mitsch  wells fargo securities llc awesome and albert you mentioned earlier on that some of the environmental actions taken by the chinese has had an impact on the pvc area can you provide a little more color on what youre seeing there and how long term you think that may be are we looking at permanent shutdowns or are we just looking at shortterm shutdowns and how should we think about whats going on in that part of the world albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp okay well i dont have all the details but what i understand is that the enforcement of environmental rules are more strict than in the past and applies not only to the chemical plants but also applies to derivative fabrication plants so it has impact throughout the chinese industries and the biggest impact have been on the coastal region where the populations are and as well as during the colder months when much coal is burned so i think they may have been less strict in the summer months when theres less coal burning going on but i think by and large on the average the chinese authorities are more strict on environmental compliance in all industries going forward second part is the trucking overloading has been again â are enforcing these rules so the cost of transporting finished goods or carbide  has increased as well so all these have increased costs for the plants and coastal plants are more affected than inland plants frank j mitsch  wells fargo securities llc and so the way we should see this manifest itself is through higher exports of vc and pvc edc and caustic out of north america is that the thought process here albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp certainly north american costs are more competitive with our lowcost ethylene and lowcost power and lowcost chloralkali manufacturing costs so we are more competitive however the chinese  not their only goal and when caustic prices gone up they can allow them to export pvc even the costs have gone up because higher caustic price they can afford some of them to export pvc so we are seeing  chinese prices have come down from its high we saw in early spring but this is also construction season not only in the us and north america but also in china and the rest of the world so second and the third quarter usually are stronger months for the vinyls business and hence the price increase we have into north america as well frank j mitsch  wells fargo securities llc thank you so much albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp youre very welcome operator and our next question comes from the line of matthew blair from tudor pickering holt your line is now open matthew blair  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc hey good morning albert and steve albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp morning matthew mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp good morning matthew blair  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc maybe turning back to the feedstock question at calvert city so some of the marcellus eps are reporting ethane pricing about  or  below gulf coast pricing but theres also some new pipeline coming out of the marcellus both going east and west over the next year or two so how do you see that basis shaping up do you still expect to realize a pretty significant discount to gulf coast ethane pricing at calvert city going forward or do you think that basis is going to narrow due to the new pipeline capacity albert yuan chao  westlake chemical corp yeah as i mentioned earlier that our purchase for ethane at calvert city is market pricerelated matthew blair  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay okay and then i guess a question for steve we saw a little bit of debt repaid in the first quarter how much more should we expect for the rest of  and could you remind us of your longterm targets in this area thanks mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp yeah certainly you can expect it well continue to look to delever the balance sheet so theres certainly opportunity to retire additional debt through the course of this year and even into early next as opportunities permit so our focus really is to keep that strong balance sheet and remain strongly in the investmentgrade spaces we are today and so that remains our focus and you can see with the focus on debt retirement and the focus on spending capital on the deferred maintenance actions thats really how were going to target the use of our capital in the next year or two matthew blair  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay thank you mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp youre welcome operator and our last question comes from of chris perrella from bloomberg intelligence your line is now open christopher silvio perrella  bloomberg intelligence thanks after the completion of calvert city could you just remind us what your net ethylene position would be mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp were at production capacity annualized is  billion pounds christopher silvio perrella  bloomberg intelligence all right and with the lotte whats the timing of the capital spending for the jv cracker mark steven bender  westlake chemical corp well be spending the capital over the next few years with a startup expected in  our total capital commitment is expected to be  million and so youd expect well be spending that as we move forward with an expected startup in  christopher silvio perrella  bloomberg intelligence all

that can be accessed on our website at westlakecom no id like to turn the call over to albert chao albert albert chao thank you ben good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining this call this morning westlake announced the acquisition of axiall this morning and we are very excited over this transaction we also look forward to welcoming the axiall employees into the westlake family and look forward to meeting them all we strongly believe the industrial and strategic logic of this transaction and we believe its compelling the combined company will be a leader in the north american olefins and vinyls business and together well create a larger more integrated and diverse company well be the second largest north american producer of pvc and the third largest chloralkali producer in the north american markets this transaction is consistent with our history of vertical integration which captures the margins across the chain and through the cycles the acquisition greatly extends our manufacturing footprint and positions us for future growth we believe we will achieve annual synergies of  million per year and the transaction will be accretive in the first year after close axiall is a leader in the chloralkali pvc and building products businesses its chloralkali and pvc businesses include seven chemical sites and four pvc compounding facilities with over  billion pounds of chemical capacity per annum its pvc building products businesses include products such as sidings deck trim molding and various pipe products axialls  firstquarter last  months revenue was  billion and ebitda of  million steven bender so turning to the transaction let me provide you an overview of the transaction westlake and axiall announced today that theyve entered into the agreement to acquire axiall stock for  in an allcash transaction the enterprise value is  billion including the assumption of  billion of axiall debt this is a  times cycle average with synergies westlake has in place a  billion bridge loan provided by deutsche bank and goldman sachs and westlake is committed to maintaining a strong investmentgrade credit rating this transaction will require axiall shareholder vote which we expect to be dealt with very quickly as we go through the coming months we do not expect any regulatory issues and thus expect to close by q  so lets review a few of the key highlights of this transaction as albert noted it creates a north american chlorovinyls leader with enhanced scale secondly it highly integrates the chain in the us margin and brings margin stability for the combined company thirdly it creates the opportunity for us to capture value through the synergy opportunities that albert just noted fourth the combination combine of axiall and westlake builds a history built on westlakes history of integration and strategic growth and of course importantly it works off the strong financial profile that westlake brings and our strong financial culture with that ill turn it back over to albert to add some more detail to these particular issues albert albert chao thanks steve the combined entity is a leader in the north american chlorovinyl markets as we said earlier the combination creates the number three north american chloralkali producer and the number two pvc producer in the north american markets it also provides greater scale and synergies with westlakes existing businesses includes vinyls business and olefins business it better positions us in this increasing global competition we also have greater ability to serve customers with the combination and capitalizes on future investment opportunities the combined business will have a broader geographical footprint that will include westlakes vinyls business in europe which is the global leader in specialty pvc resins it is also worth highlighting that westlake is also a leading north american olefins producer being the largest integrated low density polyethylene to ethylene producer in north america finally our sales will also see a significant increase by about  to  billion per annum and a combined company will benefit from this improved scale now lets look at the integration for the businesses we are fully integrated in our olefins chain from ethylene to polyethylene and styrene as shown in the dark blue boxes we are currently one of the most integrated vinyls producer in the us and possibly one of the lowest production cost locations globally as shown in the light blue boxes our strategy is to continue to integrate our businesses throughout the olefins and vinyls chain for example our new qualified facility in geismar louisiana which completed our chlorine integration in  we completed a ethylene destock conversion and expansion project in calvert city kentucky in the first half of  and have another expansion planned in the ethylene business in  that along with smaller improvements will have added some additional  pounds ethylene capacity to calvert city by  we are also currently debottlenecking our petro  unit in lake charles louisiana which will add another  million pounds of ethylene capacity which when combined with our calvert city expansion will give us total of  million pounds of new ethylene capacity by  on the downstream side we will use a significant portion of our pvc to make pvc building products and this acquisition is exactly consistent with our strategy the strategy allows us to not be completely dependent on one single commodity product and profits have been made at different places along the value chain throughout the cycle thus the acquisition of axiall creates a stronger company with significantly increased scale greater product diversity and integration throughout the value chain steven bender our synergy estimate that we mentioned earlier  million reflects the input from westlakes operational and commercial teams based on due diligence that we performed and the synergies fall in four buckets general and administrative procurement and supply chain manufacturing and sales and marketing the synergy opportunities we derived are all from identifiable cost synergies the annual run rate of synergies is  million a year comprised of these cost synergies and the opportunities that we see in front of us westlake is a leading integrated plastics materials company in the olefins and vinyls chain as albert outlined the four points that you see in our mission statement that we use are very important we pursue profitable growth and as a result are always working to create and grow value for our shareholders we are focused in businesses that we understand we do business globally where we can gain a competitive edge and we always act in a financially disciplined manner as i mentioned we are focused in the olefins and vinyls business and our main products in our olefins business is polyethylene polyethylene is the largest plastic material used in the world and its ideal for choices of countless consumer nondurable products largely used in food packaging our vinyls business makes pvc pvc is known as the poor mans plastic because half of that raw material was made from relatively cheap nonhydrocarbonbased chlorine its unique set of properties make it the plastic of choice in many consumer durable applications the chart that you may have seen on our presentation illustrates westlakes growth from inception in  through our planned  sic  see slide   capacity expansions in calvert city that albert just mentioned and of course the acquisition of axiall please note that as we have achieved this growth both through acquisition as well as through organic growth opportunities at westlake we are not just looking for ways to grow the company but to strategically grow the company through the prudent use of our strong balance sheet now as we turn to our financial profile we importantly want to maintain a strong financial profile and generate and we continue to see generation of strong cash flows from the combined companies and we expect this transaction will be accretive in the first year following our close westlake is committed to maintain an investment grade credit rating and the transaction is supported by westlakes large cash balance now id like to turn the call back over to albert for some comments albert albert chao thank you steve in summary we strongly believe the industrial and strategic logic of this transaction and is very compelling the combined company will be a leader in the north american olefins and vinyls businesses well be the second largest north american producer of pvc and the third largest chloralkali producer in the north american markets as well as we are the largest north american producer of ldpe integrated with ethylene and this transaction is consistent with our history of vertical integration which captures the margins across the chain and through the cycles and on a global basis which will create value for our shareholders thank you very much for listening today ben ederington i would like to turn the call over to the operator to see if there are any questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets arun viswanathan good morning congratulations on the deal albert chao good morning arun steven bender thank you arun viswanathan i guess my question is just on the point of integration post close youll be a little but more levered to be in chlorine and caustic i guess how do you expect to kind of bridge the gap on the ethylene side as far as backward integration albert chao well we mentioned earlier we are going through extensions in two of our ethylene plants so we have more ethylene to be used in the integration and secondly we will always look for other opportunities to strengthen our ethylene positions arun viswanathan and there are a couple other options out there i guess as far as crackers available as well as the lotte proposed cracker would those also be on the table as potential increases in ethylene capacity albert chao yes we look forward to working with lotte and its management in the new ethylene joint venture in lake charles arun viswanathan the next question i had was just on the synergies and the overall capacity footprint it looks like there could be some overlap in the gulf coast on some of your facilities and you have the new geismar facility which theoretically is lower cost than some of the facilities that youre acquiring would footprint optimization or actualization be also a consideration that you would consider down the line albert chao i think both axiall and westlake have very good plans along the gulf coast and a very good people and we plan to build upon the strength of each of these plants and grow our westlakes business on a global basis arun viswanathan and then the last question i just had was just strategically many of the acquisitions that youve pursued in the past albert have been a little bit specialty in nature i mean how would you characterize the value proposition here many of axialls products could be construed as relatively commodity in nature thanks albert chao yes we are a commodity company with segments of business in specialty we find the axiall business is very compelling and will be a good match with westlakes businesses and integrate very well going forward arun viswanathan okay thanks albert chao youre welcome operator our next question comes from don carson with susquehanna financial don carson a couple of modeling questions steve what kind of purchase accounting stepup do you expect in the first year as you do your accretion analysis and then can you expand on the timing of the synergies when do you hit that  million and break those synergies out by each of the four buckets that youve outlined steven bender don the  million synergy that we outlined we have not yet given any further detail in how they break out into the four buckets but you would imagine some of the public company cost would disappear as a result of this combination as it relates to doing the work as it relates to the valuation of work obviously well get started on that and i dont yet have any guidance for you but well look and be communicating that as we go forward but again weve just completed this transaction and so well give some better help on that as we go forward don carson and then how about on debt levels and interest rate how much of that  billion facility will you be drawing down what would you expect your average financing rate to be as you fund this acquisition steven bender well you know we have a very conservative financial policy and that remains very much the bedrock of westlake and so as we think about the structure that we look to structure of the transaction around were going to be targeting to maintain that strong investmentgrade balance sheet that weve had and enjoy and expect to continue to enjoy so as we think about how well finance this transaction well be interacting with the agencies and looking back at how weve operated the business historically to make sure that weve done so and weve not given specific guidance yet in terms of how well be financing this or how well be layering in the tranches but certainly well be certainly better communicating that as we go forward but at this stage we wanted to really focus on the business combination and the opportunities that we see don carson thank you operator our next question comes from david begleiter with deutsche bank david begleiter thank you good morning albert maybe you could just talk about why you find chloralkali and pvc attractive at this point in the cycle albert chao well as steve mentioned pvc is a poor mans plastics and they use chlorine as half of the feedstock and it was just relatively cheap and lowcost solid to lowcost power with that lowcost natural gas price in the us so i think us is one of the lowestcost producer to produce ethylene and chlorine and as well as pvc and theres a large growth of demand for pvc going forward especially in the developing nations so i think the us will be a great place to supply the worlds needs going forward david begleiter very good and just lastly maybe for steve as well as you just on synergies whats the potential to exceed that  million target youve laid out today steven bender well certainly i think the  million is a number that we believe we can achieve and certainly as we get into the business well be looking to achieve more if we can find it but certainly i think the  million is the number you should be working with and the number that we will work aggressively to achieve as quickly as practical david begleiter thank you albert chao youre welcome operator our next question comes from roger spitz with bank of america merrill lynch roger spitz thank you good morning albert chao good morning roger spitz can you tell us if westlake will provide a downstream guaranteed to axialls debt and what are your plans regarding axialls bonds and credit facility thank you steven bender what we will do what our expectation is well obviously assume those bonds and well be providing either a guarantee or providing an exchange offer there roger roger spitz either guarantee or exchange offer thank you very much albert chao youre welcome operator our next question comes from hassan ahmed with alembic global hassan ahmed good morning albert and steve albert chao good morning hassan hassan ahmed i just wanted to revisit the whole synergy side of things so if i take a look at what axiall was runrating in terms of ebitda back in  the number was close to  million now you compare that to  and the number had fallen down to  million right then if i do a compare and contrast i look at pvc prices  versus  i look at your alkali prices prices for all of axialls products are flat to up  versus  their raw material costs be it nat gas be it ethylene are down significantly so to me correct me if im wrong they had a series of sort of planned and unplanned outages through the course of this time period so i would imagine operational synergies could run north of  million what am i missing over here steven bender well i think hassan when you think about the synergies that weve outlined i think the  million i think as i mentioned earlier is the number that we believe is deliverable if theres additional opportunity that requires additional capital to improve the business and operate the business those are separate from this transaction but certainly we would certainly look to improve the business and grow the business opportunity set and certainly as you can well imagine well be looking to do what we can to find additional value here but the value of  million a year that weve identified in synergies i believe are deliverable and realistic for this transaction hassan ahmed very fair so if i were to take a look at some of the sort of earlier presentations from the axiall side of things they would consistently point to a midcycle number which was around  million im sure you guys have run your own numbers is that roughly sort of ballpark what youre coming up with for the midcycle earnings power steven bender hassan as you know we dont give earnings guidance and i wouldnt want to use another companys guidance for our business and so i think as you know us well we say what we do and we do what we say and i think what you see is weve not historically given guidance for our business and that has not changed but i wouldnt want to suggest that we should be using someone elses guidance attributable to our business hassan ahmed fair enough and one final one if i may tim mann had basically stated that he would in the second half of the year sort of consider some chloralkali rationalization what are your thoughts about that would you carry on with that or would that be sold steven bender well as albert mentioned we clearly have a strong desire to really understand the operations of axiall and understand the business as well and so certainly there is no plan at this stage to do anything of that sort hassan ahmed perfect thank you so much guys albert chao youre welcome operator our next question comes from aleksey yefremov with nomura aleksey yefremov good morning everyone thank you could you address any potential tax benefits of the deal axiall does have some nols do you think westlake could use some of that and any thoughts on the tax aspect steven bender certainly as we look at the tax nols a large part of those are certainly in canada but well certainly alex be looking to optimize the tax structure as you know we have operations in canada as well but i think for your modeling purposes i would given the scale of our business and the scale of their of axialls business i think still the run rate of  is probably the right rate to use at least for the time being aleksey yefremov and going back to the question of the cycle you address some of that but is it fair to assume that youre at least somewhat bullish on chloralkali cycle here on the caustics and the chlorine prices albert chao well as hassan mentioned three full years ago the ecu value was higher margin was higher and what happened was there were expansions going on in the us chloralkali industry and theres still some going on this year but after this year we have not heard any new capacity expansions so when the global demand for chloralkali improves and absorbs this extra capacity then we believe supply and demand will improve going forward thats not a lot of capacity added in the world and europe with the mercury cell conversion people are estimating between  to  million ton reduction in chloralkali capacity in europe so that could help our future global chloralkali businesses aleksey yefremov and a final question if i may did considerations for putting chloralkali assets into mld enter into your evaluation and what are your current thoughts on that steven bender alex weve never seen anybody do such a thing and as you know theres a regulation being written now by the irs and treasury that would define what does and doesnt qualified so i think its clear to say that from what weve seen of their writings not much qualifies until they define that it does so i think we all have to look back at what worked and what didnt at this stage and say well see what goes forward aleksey yefremov okay thank you very much albert chao youre welcome operator our next question comes from frank mitsch with wells fargo securities frank mitsch good morning gentlemen a deal four years in the making albert i guess good things do come to those who wait axiall made a big point a few weeks ago about a public announcement that they reopened their data room for you to have another look at all their financials et cetera and then obviously we just see a bump a  bump in the price that youre willing to pay i assume that also during that time period and during this whole process that youve been studying the  million synergy number that axiall believes could be achieved from this transaction and yet today youre still talking about this  million deliverable what about that what in the  million synergy number that axiall has thrown out there do not quite agree with or perhaps is there some conservatism going on here steven bender well frank its steve i think when you think about the number that we put forth as you can imagine weve had this discussion with axialls management team and had a chance to understand it and i think that we still were very comfortable with the number that we put forth and thats really where i think we are so weve had that conversation weve had an opportunity to understand those numbers and i think the  million synergy is the number that i believe we can deliver and we will deliver i think some of the numbers that might be above and beyond that may require additional capital and well see but thats separate from this transaction frank mitsch all right thats helpful steve in the press release you talked about the transaction being accretive year one what sort of assumptions were you using in terms of the underlying axiall ebitda and the realization of synergies to make that statement steven bender well as you know we dont give ebitda forecasts but i think its fair to assume that the synergies would be achieved over a couple year time period of course there are going to be costs associated with achieving those synergies at the same time but i think its fair to assume that well achieve those over a coupleyear time period frank mitsch thank you albert chao youre welcome operator our next question comes from john roberts with ubs john roberts thanks congratulations on the deal maybe you can answer my questions steven bender ill try john john roberts steve you mentioned layering tranches of debt here but you didnt mention equity westlake was willing to issue stock in its initial bid here so postclosing if your stock is at or above current levels should we expect you to accelerate that reduction by issuing stock or having a convertible component of your debt or something like that steven bender well john as you know we have always had a historically strong and very consistent financial strategy and our policies our financial policies have been very consistent on that front and so theres nothing contemplated at this stage as it relates to an equity component of that but i think its quite clear that weve maintained a strong and very consistently position on maintaining an investmentgrade stance and that remains here so well continue to work to make sure that we always have a strong balance sheet and an investmentgrade rating from the agencies john roberts okay and then maybe to get to the cycle questions you were being asked earlier on slide  where you have the pie chart showing chloralkali as a larger contributor than ethylene to the vinyls margins over the last cycle obviously in recent years its been more ethylene than its been chlorine or chloralkali to the vinyls market as you modeled the future here or justifying the price that youre paying what kind of ratio were you considering as you kind of model this out do you consider that normal going forward or do you consider something else normal steven bender well as you know we dont give forward projections at all so but what i think is instructive here is when you look back in time whether it be this time period which is a fairly lengthy period over the cycle or you look at any other say shorter period of time what is clear is the mix of chloralkali and ethylene will move as you noted back and forth but what is important and very much so is the integration and i think its that integration strategy that albert spoke to that we think is so very important in this industry and in this business and i think that hallmark of integration is very much how we built our business and how you see us continuing to be focused in building this business john roberts okay thank you albert chao youre welcome operator our next question comes from james sheehan with suntrust robinson james sheehan thank you for taking my question on the integration strategy albert do you see your ethylene position as being balanced with this transaction and what the lotte jv or do you need other ethylene sources in order to achieve that integration albert chao yes as we understand with the supply of ethylene from the lotte jv is only for half of the plant so the axiall business still will be short of ethylene even taking in half of the jvs ethylene james sheehan so what would your strategy be would you be purchasing ethylene at that point or would you consider further expansions in your own system albert chao we will look at all the above as of now axiall is buying ethylene and so eventually we will be balanced or excess for shortterm in the longterm we look at debottlenecking purchasing ethylene potential jv purchasing assets many other alternatives were looking for ways to increase value for our assets james sheehan great and can you comment on where you think chloralkali operating rates will be in north america in  albert chao i hope its better james sheehan great thank you very much albert chao youre welcome operator our next question comes from bob koort with goldman sachs ryan berney good morning this is ryan berney on for bob steven bender good morning ryan ryan berney were there any change of control provisions between the axiall lotte jv that wouldve changed that agreement at all post this deal steven bender no theres nothing that impacts that venture as it relates to our transaction with axiall ryan berney thanks and then secondarily given some of the operating issues that axiall had over the last couple of years would you expect a period of kind of elevated maintenance capex out of the gate steven bender well certainly what well do is well spend time assessing operations as we would do with any asset and do as we have done with our business over time is to make sure that the businesses operate at their peak operability and so as you know we pride ourselves in running operations at consistently good operating rates because of the integration certainly well assess the opportunities to see if these plans can be improved and we know weve got very good people onsite and we look to work with them handinglove in that process ryan berney great thank you very much steven bender youre welcome operator our next question comes from christopher perrella with bloomberg intelligence christopher perrella good morning thank you for taking my call what conversations have you had with the rating agencies so far and is there a longerterm leverage ratio steve that you would like to get back to down to overtime steven bender we have an ongoing dialogue with the agencies of course weve spoken to them recently about this transaction but we also have a very good ongoing dialogue with the agencies and our consistent strong financial policy has been very much the hallmark of that dialogue and so as we think about the transaction in front of us what weve said very consistently and they hear us is that we intend to maintain that investmentgrade rating that we enjoy today and that continues to be where we expect to be with the end of this transaction completed so as we go forward that is very much what we see in front of us and as i say we have a very good relationship with them and an ongoing dialogue christopher perrella all right thank you and is there anything that could cause the transaction to slip into  steven bender we dont contemplate it at this stage as i mentioned earlier we have regulatory filings that will be made in just a couple of countries and weve already given an outline timeframe that we expect these filings to be completed in the transaction close being toward the end of the third quarter early fourth quarter christopher perrella thank you very much operator our next question comes from david wang with morningstar david wang thank you for taking my question i had a followup question on the synergy so within the sales and marketing bucket of that would you consider that a cost or a revenue synergy steven bender well the sales and marketing its actually a  it can be a as i see it it is a cost opportunity not a revenue synergy so when we think about it were looking at ways in which we can operate in our business much more effectively in the sales and marketing arena not necessarily looking at it as a revenue opportunity but managing the cost associated with that opportunity david wang okay great and then for the ethylene cracker with the jv that axiall has i guess do you still value creation from it with the current ethylene margins where they are and considering that its essentially going to be a greenfield expansion as opposed to the brown fields that youve been pursuing albert chao certainly today ethane cracking still enjoy the lowest costs among the various feedstocks and going forward that forecast is that ethane still will be the preferred feedstock in the us and in the world as well so we look forward to understand more about the joint venture and structure and we like to being the shareholder to make this joint venture a very successful joint venture david wang all right great thank you albert chao youre welcome operator our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan q âunidentified analyst good morning its delta cook for jeff albert chao good morning q âunidentified analyst do think the cash costs for the  million synergies will also be  million steven bender weve not given specific guidance but generally rules of thumb tend to be in that order of magnitude q âunidentified analyst okay and in terms of the combined dna do you think is going to be something that is bigger than  million i guess if you have to take a first guess i know not all the variables are known but do you think it would be in that range or it would be significantly higher or lower than that steven bender once weve completed our evaluation analysis we will have an opportunity to have a more broad discussion of what the dna tends to be but once  what we need obviously to complete is our evaluation analysis and then we will have a better opportunity to have a more complete and robust discussion about depreciation q âunidentified analyst okay thanks very much albert chao youre welcome operator our next question comes from simi sea ph with fny capital q âunidentified analyst hello sorry my question has been answered thank you congrats operator our next question comes from sunil sibal with seaport global securities sunil sibal hello good morning guys and congratulations on the transaction albert chao good morning thank you sunil sibal most of my questions have been address but i was kind of curious with regard to your start of the year on the mlp side you clearly have taken a very fluent approach so far in terms of job balancing with mlp and i wondering as you kind of think of deleveraging the pay rate post the transaction how do you think about using the mlp currency steven bender well certainly as weve said from the beginning of the launch of the partnership that we see this as a opportunity to use it as a very cost effective form of capital it is relatively small relative to the parent and so its opportunities itself have to be taken into consideration but we certainly see it as an opportunity to use it as a form of currency for opportunities so certainly as we look forward into the future we continue to expect the partnership to be part of that overall mix sunil sibal got it and then in terms of the latter jv timeline of building the new cracker any changes do you anticipate other than that this transaction i think previously axiall had talked about a lead  as kind of a start up for that albert chao we dont know anything more than whats known to the public so far sunil sibal got it okay thanks guys congrats to you albert chao youre welcome thank you operator our next question comes form bill cambilair ph with seaport group unidentified analyst my questions have been answered thank you very much operator our next question comes from jeff gates with gates capital markets jeff gates i have a couple questions you referenced a  times cycle average i believe that was an ebitda number and im wondering is that a number that includes synergy steven bender yes that does jeff gates so that would be if i did the math right about  million which that would include the  million of synergies so youre saying  steven bender yes its in that neighborhood thats correct jeff gates but do you think the midcycle average for axiall is about  million steven bender yes and we are talking about a period of probably five or six years jeff gates okay and then the second question is what do you think the ongoing capital required to be competitive at axiall is sort of a normalized capex number steven bender well its a good question and as i mentioned earlier well come in and assess all the capital projects not only in axiall but in westlake at this time we want to maintain a very disciplined way in which we are spending capital but where we see opportunities well certainly avail ourselves of those opportunities and so you would imagine that well take a fresh look at the newly combined businesses and look at all those opportunities so i think im going to have to hold an answer until weve had a chance to do that assessment jeff gates but you did diligence and you came up with a price that youre paying for it so what was your base case assumption in getting to the price that you were willing to pay for the asset steven bender well certainly that was an exercise in doing the modeling work for evaluation purposes but to be more specific what id like to do is give you a more refined answer after weve had a chance to meet with the people that are running the businesses and give you a better clearer answer jeff gates okay thank you steven bender youre welcome operator our next question comes from lawrence stalin ph with sinkling capital q â unidentified analyst steve i had a bond specific questions if you dont mind earlier on the call in response to roger spitz question you said your current expectation is to assume the bonds and likely provide either a downstream guarantee or execute an exchange offer im not sure i understand what an exchange offer would be in this situation steven bender well in this situation in a classic exchange offer its exchanging the axiall bonds for westlake bonds at the same terms and conditions q â unidentified analyst okay and as you know most of onerous covenants under the axiall indentures would be stripped upon ig but the financial reporting covenant would not be steven bender that is correct q â unidentified analyst is that enough of a nuisance time and expense to encourage you to seek to take those bonds out and i guess that might be related to the exchange rate offer as well steven bender well if you do an exchange offer then you dont have a separate audit to perform q â unidentified analyst okay thanks steve steven bender thank you operator our next question comes from owen douglas with baird owen douglas thanks for taking the questions here got a lot of good ones been asked already but i just curious so axiall is marketing the building product segment is there any sort of standstill while this transactions waiting to be closed on that steven bender im sorry youre asking whether there will be a standstill on that transaction owen douglas yes while your transaction acquire axialls pending will there be any standstill on the marketing of axialls building products business and if that were to be marketed  oh sorry you answered steven bender yes there will not be a transaction on that front owen douglas okay i see and how do you guys view the building products segment of axiall with regards to the portfolio is that noncore or is that something which you guys want to continue to own steven bender well you may know that we have our own building products division and certainly well be assessing that in terms of how it does fit into in terms of how it fits into our overall business and so as i mentioned we see that as a valued business and well assess it in terms of how it fits into the overall view of our building products divisions owen douglas okay thank you albert chao youre welcome operator ladies
