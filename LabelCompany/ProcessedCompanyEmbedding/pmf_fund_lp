endowment advisers lp �the adviser� or the �firm� and shall be effective on october�  the code shall serve as the code of ethics required by rule a promulgated under the investment advisers act of  and rule j promulgated under the investment company act of  and is applicable to all �supervised persons� as defined in exhibit a of the firm the cco of the firm except as specifically noted herein shall be responsible for maintaining and enforcing this code in our efforts to ensure that the adviser maintains and enhances its reputation for integrity and high ethical standards it is essential not only that the firm and its supervised persons comply with all relevant federal and state securities laws but also that we maintain high standards of personal and professional conduct this code is designed to help ensure that we conduct our business consistent with these high standards and incorporates the primary principles of fiduciary duty integrity and professionalism that are the guiding principles of the cfa institute code of ethics and standards of professional conduct �  standards of business conduct as a registered investment adviser the firm and its supervised persons owe a fiduciary duty to our clients that require each of us to place the interests of our clients ahead of our own interests a critical component of our fiduciary duty is to avoid andor disclose potential conflicts of interest accordingly all supervised persons must avoid activities interests and relationships that might interfere or appear to interfere with making decisions in the best interests of our advisory clients please bear in mind that a conflict of interest can arise even if there is no financial loss to our clients and regardless of the supervised person�s motivation the code is designed to address and avoid potential conflicts of interest relating to personal trading and related activities and is based on three underlying principles � a we must at all times place the interests of our advisory clients first in other words as a fiduciary you must scrupulously avoid serving your own personal interests ahead of the interests of the firm�s advisory clients � b we must make sure that all personal securities transactions are conducted consistent with this code and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential conflicts of interest or any abuse of an
