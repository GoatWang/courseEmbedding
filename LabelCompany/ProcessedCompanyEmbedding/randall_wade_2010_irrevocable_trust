think everyone should have access to good legal advice our services help you solve legal issues learn more about your legal situation and navigate the legal process—all with easeyour guide to online legal researchits tough to know where to start when youre researching legal questions with this guide youll be able to define your legal issue research it and get the help you needstep  define your legal issuewhen youre just getting started there are a few things to figure out about your legal issue—like is it a criminal or civil case which laws apply—municipal state federal and what area of the law represents your issue once you have answers to these questions you can start researching and learning about possible outcomes and next stepsis this a true legal issuefirst you need to determine whether you have a legal issue or simply a problem maybe you dont like your downstairs neighbor playing loud music during the day but if theyre not breaking any laws what you have is a personal matter not a legal onea legal problem is one that can be solved by using the law its an issue thats addressed within federal state or municipal laws and regulationscan i sueif youve determined that your problem is a legal one you might be wondering if you can sue while in theory you can pretty much sue anyone for anything the reality is that doing so is often a waste of time and money its always a good idea to consult with an attorney to determine whether you can take your suit to court you might consider mediation or arbitration firstthe question should not be “can i sue” but “should i sue”consider the followingdo you have a written contract with the party you want to sue if you dont have a written contract do you believe you had a clear agreement even if it wasnt written downcan you demonstrate that the party you want to sue violated their part of the agreement can you demonstrate that you held up your enddo you think you have a good chance of winningis this a good use of your time and resources weigh the cons like time money and stress against the possible pros like justice and compensation its also worth determining if the party youre sueing has enough money to pay your claimis this a criminal matter or a civil matterthere are two main types of legal issues criminal matters and civil matters in criminal cases the government prosecutes the case in civil cases the person bringing the suit hires an attorney to prosecute if youve been arrested youre looking at a criminal matter but depending on the circumstances it could be a civil matter as wellcivil lawsuits are easier to win because the burden of proof is lower and its not necessarily one or the other there can be a criminal case and a civil case for the same matter if youre considering whether or not to sue someone or you have been sued youre looking at a civil matterthere are two main types of legal issues criminal matters and civil matterswhat about municipal state and federal lawsfederal state and local governments each have their own sets of laws your legal issue will likely fall under one of these three categories depending on your issue you may want to research all threefor any legal issue make sure you do it in the correct court and consult with an attorney to figure out which court to file inwhat practice area does it fall underthe best way to research your legal issue is to start by identifying the broad category that it falls under you may have noticed that lawyers almost always associate themselves with “practice areas” these are the areas they have particular experience and knowledge in common practice areas include but are not limited to corporate law criminal law estate planning employment law personal injury and business law you probably wouldnt want to talk to a heart surgeon about a sprained ankle and similarly you probably dont want an attorney in criminal law to handle a divorcefinding the most relevant practice area can be tricky for instance you know that your issue is about medical malpractice but you may not know that it falls under the category of personal injury law or maybe youre in the middle of a situation—like youve asked your landlord to add a disabled parking spot outside your building and your landlord has refused you could be looking into three separate topics tenantlandlord laws discrimination and civil rightsif you still aren’t sure how to categorize your issue you can ask a question about it or read recently asked questions on avvo’s free qa forumstep  research your legal issueonce youve defined your legal issue you can start researching online its helpful to begin by breaking down all the facts—this process will help you identify some important keywords that you can use to kick off your researchwhat are the factswhen researching a legal issue many attorneys get to the facts of the case by using a common legal research method called tarp which stands for thing cause of action relief sought personparties involved you can do the same tthingacause of actionrrelief soughtppersonparties involvedstart with the thing whats the subject matter it could be one thing for example—a divorce or it could be a couple things like divorce plus child custodythen look at the cause of action that is how were you wronged under the law this may be an issue like negligence breach of contract fraud or slandernext is relief sought relief could be monetary compensation for covering costs associated with the issue or for pain and suffering or it could be to prevent the defendant from engaging in certain behavior againfinally personparties involved who are the players what are their roles what are their relationships to each other for example employeremployee fatherson or neighborneighbornow that you know what

created a revocable living trust you are not obligated to continue doing business with anyone you can pick any attorney you like and have them help you with changes if you believe that changes are necessary it sounds like you might have purchased an annuity or other financial product and that the two companies are claiming to own the product  ie they are the company you pay premiums to if thats the case then you are in a bit of a pickle you might still need a lawyer to help sort things out but you might also want to contact the state insurance commissioner too i know you said that you are on a low income but you are swimming in dangerous waters having important legal documents prepared by nonattorneys who also sell financial products for a commission many of these outfits are looking to use lowprice trusts as a way to get your financial information and try to sell you expensive financial products that pay them high commissions as an analogy its like the difference between having your car repaired by your local dealership versus hiring a guy you meet in front of the local car parts store there are some halfway decent as in your house wont explode instantly document preparers out there but i would venture to guess that none of the decent ones sell financial products too thats an instant sign that youre dealing with a scam artist as far as your trust goes you should have it looked at as soon as you can afford a lawyer if there is a financial product involved you might want to talk to the insurance commissioner good luckask a similar questionmore  found this answer
