network device certification is a nonnegotiable requirement for bringing new devices onto existing carrier networks regardless of whether the module modem component within a device has passed certification any new device is required to do so as well prior to allowing commercial deployment the goal of device certification is to identify and fix issues related to the quality of service on the desired network device certification testing ensures maximum device performance and minimum risk of service disruptions that could jeopardize the entire network infrastructure what is device certification device certification is a series of standardized tests with acceptable parameters of results think passing grades these tests are conducted specifically by designated test labs that demonstrate that a device operates properly and within acceptable means when connected to a wireless network device certification is required for new modules and devices as well as whenever any changes are made to an approved module or device the actual time and cost required to complete certification will vary depending on the approval requirements the fastest and often the most costeffective device certification strategy is avoiding the need to go through the process in the first place if at all possible use a preapproved device unless there is a compelling reason to build a new one if a new end device is required make sure a preapproved module from a reputable oem is used in the design you can view a list of preapproved devices here if a preapproved device or module that
