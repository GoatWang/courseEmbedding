resources including the sale of equity or debt securities to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next  months we will require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions finalization and launch of our website implementation of our strategy to expand our sales and marketing initiatives increase brand and services awareness if our own financial resources and then current cashflows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities the sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects offbalance sheet
