of loan do you need share this postbuying land and building a new home can be an exciting experience and if you plan to get financing you need to understand your options related to lot loans land loans and construction loans what kind of loan is right for you even though it may seem obvious this question does not always have a clear answer and the subject often is misunderstood by potential borrowers it’s important to understand that these loans have unique characteristics and the lending options that are available for you will depend on factors like your personal situation the type of property you are buying your level of preparation and your timing for building a home this article will provide an overview of a lot and land loans and b home construction loans to help you consider what fits your needs a related article in this series goes into more detail about the terms for lot and land loans and another describes the terms for construction loans these loans are different most homeowners are familiar with the typical mortgage loan used to finance the purchase of an existing alreadybuilt home referred to by some as a “purchase money” mortgage or loan purchase money loans are the standard of the residential lending industry and entire financial markets mortgage products and automated systems have been created to make these loans efficient and easy for banks to underwrite and process but conventional purchase money mortgages are different from lot land and construction loans – both in how they are structured and how lenders underwrite process and account for them – and understanding these differences is perhaps the most important takeaway that potential borrowers need to grasp before seeking a loan for buying land or building a home  read about why banks treat these loans differently a fundamental basis for this difference is that before providing financing for your purchase of vacant land or a construction loan to build your home a bank needs to understand your plans for the property the purpose and timing for a purchase money loan is known and obvious – you’re buying an existing home of a certain value at your closing – but there is more uncertainty about the facts valuation and what the future holds when working with a vacant land loan or a construction loan details about the property and your overall story will influence the perceived risk to the lender and help the lender decide whether it will approve your loan for this reason land loans and construction loans are often referred to as “story loans” loans to buy vacant land or a lot ready to buy a homesite but not quite ready to build your new home many buyers are looking for – or already have found – the ideal lot or vacant property for building their future home but need to wait before they start construction life and financial situations job children selling an existing home can play a big part in whether someone is ready to start building a home from the ground up and for some the time is not right to take on the task if that is your situation you likely will want to consider some form of “lot loan” or “land loan” to make your vacant property purchase first  and later when you’re actually ready to build a home on your lot you can consider your construction loan options a lot or land loan allows you to secure your ideal homesite so you can continue to get ready to build your home borrowers can use the time after they close to plan their new home and its design if they haven’t partnered with anyone yet then some will use this time period to find their ideal home builder and maybe this time allows you to settle into a new job or your children to graduate from college from a borrower’s perspective lot and land loans are both harder to find and have less favorable terms than a conventional purchase money mortgage for a home although lot and land loans are structured and documented similar to purchase money home loans be prepared to see shorterterm loans higher down payments higher interest rates and additional borrower commitments and underwriting we have discussed both lot and land loans together here but some lenders have different loan terms and programs that distinguish between finished lots readytobuild with utilities and roads and undeveloped vacant land read more details about how lot and land loans work new home construction loans ready to have your new home built right away  if you have or soon will have all your ducks in a row – you’ve found your lot finalized your house plans and are working with a builder – then a construction loan likely is what you’re ready for construction loans typically fund the construction of custom or semicustom homes from the ground up when buying either a “spec” home that already is built or when buying new homes from production builders a buyer usually would not use a construction loan in these transactions if the builder is selling a completed home the borrower should only need a purchase money mortgage to buy the new home and the land on which it sits home construction loans are unique products and involve different paperwork procedures and funding methods when compared to many other loan types a significant difference is that home construction loans are shortterm loans that are funded in periodic advances or draws so they are not fully funded at one time like at the loan closing for the purchase of a lot land or existing home from a borrower’s perspective and much like lot and land loans construction loans usually are more difficult to obtain and will include less favorable financing terms when compared to a standard home mortgage be prepared to be faced with a larger amount of paperwork additional transaction costs a sizable down payment a very shortterm loan period and the possibility of higher interest rates although monthly payments can be interest only during the construction phase you likely will spend more of your time getting a construction loan processed and approved in the past building a new home required two loans the shortterm construction loan for the construction phase and the longterm permanent mortgage used to pay off the construction loan after the work was completed this resulted in two closings duplicate fees high transaction costs and risks for the borrower about what happens when the construction loan matures fortunately the most common option today is the constructiontopermanent loan also called a “single closing” or “allinone” construction loan that allows a borrower to have one loan one closing and the construction loan simply converts to a longterm permanent mortgage after the construction is completed funds from a construction loan can help you build a home either on a lot you already own or it can help finance the purchase of a new lot that you want to buy and then build on if you already own your lot your equity in the property can be included as part of the collateral for the construction loan if you bought the land with a lot loan then the construction loan typically would be used to payoff and refinance that first loan if you are buying a lot with the construction loan you will coordinate the closing for the purchase of the lot with the construction loan closing sometimes a homebuilder already owns lots and will offer to build a turnkey finished home for a buyer on one of its lots for builderowned lots like this the arrangement with the builder and the type of loan can vary in some circumstances a buyer would need to get a construction loan up front and buy the lot from the builder at the construction loan closing but in other cases a builder with a builderowned lot may fund the work and the buyer uses a purchase money mortgage to buy the home from the builder after the residence is completed if you are ready to start building your new home from the ground up it is likely that a construction loan is what you will need – whether or not you already own your lot free and clear you bought your lot with a land loan or you are buying your lot with the construction loan read more details about how home construction loans work finding a lender  related considerations the economic downturn and crash of the housing market continues to affect the availability of financing indeed the market for purchase money mortgages for buying new homes – the typical conventional mortgage – still is in flux and continues to make it difficult for many buyers of existing homes to get loans these difficulties are amplified for the nonconventional lot loans land loans and construction loans and this type of financing may not even be available in some markets but the housing and lending markets steadily have been improving and these issues will continue to work themselves out as time goes on if you are ready to move forward with obtaining financing then test the waters and see what options you will have it goes without saying that you should make sure your financial house is in order so that you can make your loan look attractive to lenders early in the process you should try to find a lender or mortgage broker that understands your needs and has experience in the type of loan that you are seeking getting prequalified will help you understand your budget and other financial limitations not all lenders or mortgage brokers work with loans for vacant land so make sure you are partnering with someone who has the expertise network and resources to deliver if working directly with a lender be aware that it may be more difficult to get these kinds of loans from big banks consider working with a local community bank or credit union that may be more willing to fund these types of loans for properties in their area evaluate other lending options too like va loans that can be used for new home construction or lot purchases as well as potential local and state governmentmanaged lending programs an experienced mortgage broker may have more loan options than a regular bank since they usually work with dozens of lending institutions across the country because of their variety of lending sources a mortgage broker often can get you a better loan deal than if you contacted your local bank directly if you are unable to get a loan from a traditional lender mortgage broker or government program consider alternative strategies some borrowers look to cash loans from family members and home equity loans from their existing residence to fund the purchase of a lot seller financing is another attractive possibility as many motivated land sellers may be willing to allow you to finance your purchase with them instead of making you come up with the full price at the time of the purchase some borrowers try to sell their existing home first and then rent a home so that they can more easily afford a lot purchase loan or construction loan   whether you are considering a loan to purchase a lot a loan to buy vacant land or a
