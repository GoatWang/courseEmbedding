complex litigation with a focus on cases involving the diet drug fenfluramine one half of the fenphen arena we provided a credit line of   of which was used for advertising within a few months this dramatically increased the firms caseload from approximately  to  including  new diet drug cases reinvesting in advertising while ultimately financial results from the diet drug litigation were disappointing the fenphen national settlement agreement allowed our client to obtain financing through our fee acceleration program this was reinvested in advertising for claims related to damage from the drug zyprexa used to treat types of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder the zyprexa cases turned out to be extremely successful generating fees in excess of  million however the firm would not be able to receive these funds for approximately one year this put the firm in a cash shortfall position rather than wait the client once again accessed the fee acceleration program we advanced the  million which the firm immediately reinvested into advertising to generate more zyprexa cases the bottom line though the law firm was effectively out of investible cash it was still able to bring in new cases through fee acceleration financing the result was an additional  million in fees continuing with this strategy the firm has built a large inventory of cases related to other prescription drug product liability claims in total our client has recognized at least  million in fees that would have been unavailable without the financial power of our fee acceleration apply now for your free

financing  legal funding rd legal funding home about our blog legal funding   jul  misc cyber security facta  litigation funding cyber security and identity theft are arguably the biggest issues in the world today someone’s entire life can be destroyed if their identity is stolen a person who has their identity stolen can suffer immediate and future ramifications if the matter isn’t handled in a timely manner it is why we have antivirus software to protect our devices and also why we only shop on websites where the sensitive information we input is secure as information moved into the digital world this new kind of security became a necessity new industries have been created to try to prevent identity theft and catch the individuals engaged in that type of criminal activity as the internet became a bigger part of how the world works best practices have been established for consumers and businesses engaged in commerce online some of these steps for consumers include browsing and shopping on safe and secure websites for businesses it is protecting their customers’ information when transactions take place however recent news stories reported the women’s clothing company donna karan fighting its customers over alleged violations of the fair and accurate credit transactions act facta facta is an act that contains provisions to assist in the reduction of identity theft the act enables consumers to take preventative measures to guard their identity recently law  reported donna karan is appealing to the supreme court about a lawsuit filed by their customers over their alleged lack of diligence allowing full credit card numbers to be displayed on receipts that mistake can cause severe damage to someone in the wrong hands the other issue in this matter regarding facta could be the culpability of the business and what it may mean for them in terms of lawsuits “consumers have the ability to file litigation against companies that are irresponsible with their personal information” says roni dersovitz founder of rd legal funding “litigation funding allows plaintiffs to pursue lawsuits against wellcapitalized defendants that have the ability to overwhelm them in a court of law” huge retailers are currently or have been in litigation for this very issue target walmart and others have been sued for reckless endangering their customers’ personal financial

legislators lobbyists and advocates on both sides some critics of the bill argued that national security was at risk should it pass they said it would leave us military forces open to litigation from foreign citizens and foreign entities supporters of the bill argued that the scope was narrow enough in that they were targeting companies and entities that had something or allowed certain transactions which led to the september th attacks the legislation passed and president obama vetoed it congress then overturned it the bill became law while there are plans for the families of the victims to pursue litigation this lawsuit by the insurance companies is the first since jasta passed osama bin laden and his al qaeda network were behind the september th attacks and many of the

important to a settled case award or settled case fee because the purchasing power of either is part of the evaluation of the overall settlement if there happens to be a settlement that takes place in  and the settled case fee or award is deemed to be  million but it won’t be paid until  that can be a real problem the uncertainty of the economy in  years could have drastic results for the recipients that  year gap between being awarded and actually receiving the fee leaves it susceptible to rising interest rates rising interest rates decrease the purchasing power of that  million which could lead to a plaintiff or their attorney to determine the settlement as not acceptable if interest rates rise a percentage or two that will reduce the amount of money expected settled case awards with annuity type payments structured settlements situations where a settlement occurs and the plaintiffs decide to to defer receiving the entire award at once and receive periodic payments over time periodic payments that is a structured settlement some of the reasons why a plaintiff would decide to use this option include tax liability financial stability and time value of money a plaintiff may leave themselves exposed to a higher tax rate when they take their award the plaintiff may already be financially stable and may not need the money until a specific time in the future structured attorney fees  when an attorney gets their fee after a settlement successful verdict or judgment they have the option to choose to take their fee upfront where they will be taxed at a higher rate by the government there are options plaintiffs’ attorneys have where they can structure the fee and invest their fee into different products where they can earn more on their potential investment companies like metlife millennium settlement consulting and pacific life offer plaintiffs’ attorneys the ability to structure their fees some of the benefits for structuring their fees include reducing tax exposure setting up retirement income structured income over a period of time instead of a lump sum taxes  once a plaintiff receives their settlement after attorney fees have been taken out the medical costs have been paid there is only one entity left to get their pay and that is the united states government through the internal revenue service irs according to the irs’website a plaintiff does not have to pay taxes if they have not deducted medical expenses in the prior years if the proceeds are from a personal injury lawsuit in an employment law settlement the proceeds connected to lost wages are subject to regular wage taxes social security and medicare rates in that year punitive damages from a settlement are treated as other income advice one should consult with

subsidiary of the lannett company and mallinckrodt pharmaceuticals which were both given opportunities to request a hearing by the fda to show why their drugs shouldn’t be withdrawn ordinarily a move like this from the fda would lead to a flurry of lawsuits patients cannot sue the manufacturers relating to efficacy or labeling of the drug also because they are generic manufacturers the companies cannot change the formula or labels on their own even if new information about safety and side effects are discovered the united states supreme court upheld this idea in a  to  decision that

baby powder they market their product for women’s use too studies have been conducted since the s on the negative side effects of talcum powder use in the female genital area but johnson  johnson never informed their consumers about the risk of using their products containing the powder because the results were inconclusive there was no grounding evidence to support the link between ovarian

and paste the code into your website or blog the cfpb and the new york attorney general this week filed an action against rd legal funding llc two of its affiliates and their principal collectively “rd” alleging that a litigation settlement advance product offered by rd is a disguised usurious loan that is deceptively marketed and abusive  in particular the complaint alleges that the transactions were falsely marketed as assignments rather than loans that the transactions violate new york usury laws and that rd misrepresented when the funding would be provided and falsely claimed that it could “expedite funding and ‘cut through red tape’” associated with the settlements being financed  the complaint alleges that the transactions could not be assignments because the underlying settlements expressly prohibit assignment of claimant recoveries in the complaint both the cfpb and the ag allege several deception claims and an abusiveness claim under sections  and  of doddfrank  the ag also alleges state law claims for civil and criminal usury fraud and violation of ny udap statutes  notably one of the deception claims alleged by the cfpb is predicated on alleged state usury law violations implicating one of several issues involved in the pending cashcall appeal the cfpb and the ag issued press releases and prepared remarks trumpeting the rd legal funding action as a defense of  heroes and nfl concussion victims who were “scammed” through “convoluted contracts”  the public statements also focus on the cost of the financing providing examples such as a  first responder who paid  on an advance of  when the settlement funds ultimately were received six months after the advance was made before the lawsuit was filed on january  of this year two of the rd entities filed separate preemptive actions for declaratory and injunctive relief against the cfpb and the ag  among other things these complaints challenge the cfpb’s jurisdiction over rd and the propriety of the ag’s threatened enforcement activity on the basis that rd does not extend credit but rather engages in bona fide purchases of receivables  the complaints quote extensively from the relevant agreements including the assignment provisions and nonrecourse language neither of which appear to be “convoluted” as the cfpb and ag allege  the complaint against the cfpb also attaches a prior civil investigative demand served on rd while the action filed this week may have been driven primarily by the sympathetic facts alleged in the complaint it may foreshadow a broader enforcement effort by the cfpb state attorneys general and other state regulators directed at litigation funding companies merchant cash advance providers and other finance companies whose products are structured as purchases rather than loans  while the cfpb’s jurisdiction over small business finance is limited this is not true of other enforcement authorities such as state ags  notably the cfpb previously has taken action against structured settlement and pension advance companies in the former case leading to a jurisdictional challenge supported by the us chamber of commerce  it therefore is critical for all players in this space to revisit true sale compliance both in the language of their agreements and in the company’s actual practices send print report latest postsupdated oig work plan for

practice where a third party unrelated to the lawsuit provides capital to a plaintiff involved in litigation in return for a portion of any financial recovery from the lawsuit litigation finance unlocks the value of legal claims by providing capital to plaintiffs before their cases are resolved this type of financing has existed for more than  years and is increasingly becoming a mainstream funding solution that helps equalize access to the legal system fortune  companies major universities and businesses of all sizes have benefited from litigation funding the capital provided by monetizing a legal claim may directly pay for some of the costs of litigation including attorneys’ fees expert witness fees and court expenses litigation finance may be used to fund working capital for companies involved in litigation or even help business owners pay for personal expenses unequal access to the legal system in much of the world access to justice requires abundant capital because litigation is expensive many factors contribute to the cost of litigation attorney fees research depositions interrogatories motions conferences witness preparation trials subpoenas appeals as well as expenses associated with court fees consultants and investigations all too often litigants who seek justice are unable to pursue their claims due to the high costs associated with lawsuits many plaintiffs who have a compelling case will choose to defer or ultimately abandon legal recourse a great imbalance of resources exists between average and wealthy litigants creating impediments to judicial access and a distortion of legal outcomes for the undercapitalized parties involved in litigation finance generally there are three principal participants in litigation funding – plaintiffs

litigation finance and the justice system as justice systems around the world seek to facilitate access to courts litigation finance is increasingly viewed as a critical tool for equalizing access and preventing distorted outcomes that favor wealthy litigants litigation finance improves the legal system by filtering out frivolous cases investors will not take on the risk of investing in these types of claims due to their lack of economic value in addition litigation finance can have the effect of encouraging settlement by depriving wealthy defendants of an unfair advantage even when cases do proceed in court the process becomes more streamlined because delay tactics no longer have their intended effect against the plaintiff this helps plaintiffs and attorneys achieve recoveries which are more closely aligned with the case merits and nature of their damages litigation finance offers a number of benefits litigation finance offers a number of important benefits to plaintiffs attorneys and investors plaintiffs helps undercapitalized plaintiffs further meritorious cases by financing litigation expenses provides capital injections for already filed cases that experience funding constraints reduces the risk of premature settlement for less than cases are worth unlocks liquidity for working capital provides  a cushion for personal expenses allows companies to manage how litigation costs affect their balance sheets enables greater access to top legal talent attorneys and law firms allows attorneys to accept cases from plaintiffs who otherwise could not afford their fees provides capital for all litigation expenses including expert witness fees reduces the risk that clients will run out of money during litigation enables attorneys to offer more flexible payment arrangements to prospective clients increases plaintiffs’ effectiveness by providing funding for working capital and personal expenses helps achieve recoveries that are more in line with case merits and damages investors access to new asset class investments in legal claims are uncorrelated to capital markets outsized historical returns compared with other alternative asset classes moderate time to liquidity versus other alternative investments attorneys and litigation finance most states have issued bar ethics opinions that permit litigation finance transactions provided attorneys fulfill certain disclosure requirements and avoid conflicts of interest for example attorneys are allowed to share information about cases with investors after receiving the client’s consent moreover they are allowed to honor a client’s written assignment or lien for a portion of the proceeds from a recovery the new york city bar association has recently recognized the growth of litigation funding and commented that it is a valuable means for paying the costs of pursuing a legal claim” so far twentynine jurisdictions have issued ethics opinions relating to litigation finance we have included ethics opinions from several states below california bar florida bar illinois bar los angeles county bar new york state bar  new york state bar  new york city bar  legal doctrines relating to litigation finance lexshares respects the legal issues and ethical considerations relating to investments in lawsuits several legal doctrines are frequently mentioned when discussing litigation finance in the united states they include the doctrines of maintenance champerty and barratry as well as attorneyclient privilege and work product immunity maintenance champerty and barratry maintenance involves an arrangement where a party supports another to enable him or her to further a legal claim champerty is a specific form of maintenance where an unrelated party strikes a bargain with a litigant to financially support the litigation in return for a share of the proceeds from that claim finally barratry entails the encouragement of another to bring or continue a claim these three medieval english doctrines historically prohibited thirdparty financing of lawsuits in the united states and most other common law countries today the modern view is to permit maintenance champerty and barratry as these doctrines are predominantly viewed by the courts as obsolete in medieval england maintenance and champerty was used by the powerful as a means of settling scores feudal lords and other privileged members of society would often support legal disputes of others against the supporter’s personal or political enemy most colonies that imported their laws from england – including many us states – passed laws designed to protect litigants from “officious intermeddling” and profiteering from the sale of legal claims to third parties over time as other means of controlling abuses of the legal system became more effective the need for the prohibitions on maintenance champerty and barratry became obsolete the american civil justice system increasingly recognized that access to justice depends upon the broad availability of legal representation for all socioeconomic levels the public policy for increasing access to the legal system for those that could least afford it overrode the concerns underlying these doctrines in many states according to the modern view widespread exceptions to these doctrines recognize that financial considerations often influence access to justice most states now permit maintenance champerty and barratry as they refuse to void contracts based on these outdated doctrines attorneyclient privilege and attorney work product immunity the attorneyclient privilege is a legal concept that protects certain communications between attorney and client from disclosure to the opposition in addition the workproduct immunity protects materials prepared by attorneys and third parties in anticipation of litigation from discovery these two concepts are actually two separate legal doctrines but frequently cited together recent cases support the view that litigation finance transactions preserve the protections afforded by both doctrines in mondis technology ltd v lg electronics inc  wl  ed tex a court refused to compel production of documents provided to investors more recently in devon it inc v ibm corp  wl  ed pa a court held that discussions with litigation investors are covered by the workproduct doctrine the judge in that case explained that since the investors and devon shared a common interest in the outcome of the case and had entered into the confidentiality agreement their communications were protected in a practical sense issues regarding the waiver of the attorneyclient privilege apply to only a small class of information the privilege clearly applies only to communications between a client and the attorney not just any communication about the lawsuit the client is free to tell a prospective funder anything other than what the client communicated to the attorney without waiving the privilege an investor can expect to receive substantial information from the plaintiff about the claim without ever creating waiver problems lexshares managing member and broker dealer wealthforge can evaluate the merits of cases without access to privileged information the case evaluation process generally focuses on the legal team’s assessment of the case as well as documents that are already subject to discovery additional
