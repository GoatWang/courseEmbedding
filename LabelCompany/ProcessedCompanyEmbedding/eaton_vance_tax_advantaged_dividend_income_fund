distribution of fund shares and the provision of shareholder services under rule b of the investment company act of  a fund’s b fees are typically paid to the fund’s distributor and generally pass through to intermediaries that sell fund shares permitted b fees are limited to one percent of average fund net assets annually mutual funds are often subject to b fees that vary by share class nextshares and most etfs do not pay b fees a fund’s b fees are disclosed in its prospectus and included in its total expense ratio what are transfer agency expenses the fees paid by a fund to its transfer agent and other intermediaries to process shareholder transactions and maintain shareholder accounts transfer agency costs are normally the largest component of mutual fund expenses other than management fees and b fees nextshares and etfs typically have minimal transfer agency expenses transfer agency fees are characterized as other expenses in a funds prospectus and are included in

potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills whether or not their funds increase in value mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains distributions – and associated taxes – for the funds remaining shareholders in fact sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital gains distributions nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders when market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a nextshares fund they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting through intermediaries called authorized participants here too nextshares work differently than mutual funds like etfs most nextshares funds meet redemptions through authorized participants primarily in kind  meaning that the fund

distributions mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills whether or not their funds increase in value mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by

often a leading cause of fund capital gains distributions nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not
