            water protection introduction some woods have natural durability against decay rot others can be made durable through treatment with preservatives durable species such as redwood and cedar are commonly used for wood exposed outdoors such as siding shakes and shingles decks furniture and fences durability is imparted by natural chemicals which are contained in extractives in the heartwood of these species heartwood is the center part of the wood the outer part is sapwood since only the heartwood contains extractives lumber that contains a proportion of sapwood does not have the natural durability of lumber that contains a high proportion of heartwood nondurable wood species may be factorytreated with preservative for longterm durability for use in ground contact these treatments are done in large cylinders and the preservative chemicals are forced deep into the wood using high pressure preservative chemicals include creosote pentachlorophenol ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate acza ammoniacal copper quaternary compound acq and chromated copper arsenate cca wood treated with cca is one of the most common types of preservativetreated lumber available today several other preservatives are currently used and still others are under development preservative treatments of wood are done under carefully controlled factory conditions and the wood usually has a manufacturers guarantee a number of wood preservatives certify their treatment with a tag on each piece of lumber water repellents wrs and waterrepellent preservatives wrps are penetrating wood finishes that increase the durability of wood by enabling the wood to repel liquid water this ability to repel liquid water is imparted by a wax an oil or a similar waterrepelling substance by repelling water wrs and wrps enable wood to resist decay and discoloration by wooddecay fungi which need moisture to live the addition of a fungicide to the water repellent which converts the wr to a wrp further enhances the effectiveness of the finish by inhibiting the growth of mildew and decay fungi water repellents and wrps also decrease the swelling and shrinking that lead to cracking and warping they protect the painted wood from blistering cracking and peeling in wood species that contain colored watersoluble extractives such as redwood and cedar wrs and wrps help reduce the discoloration caused by extractive bleed wood is the material of choice for many structures as with any building material the use of wood depends on its properties such as strength and stiffness as well as the finishing characteristics and maintenance requirements problems such as poor finish performance mildew checking and splitting and wood decay can be controlled with proper care and maintenance such problems can be avoided or attenuated through knowledge about the factors that affect wood particularly wood exposed outdoors if wood structures are given proper care initially and are maintained periodically they can be functional and structurally sound as well as aesthetically pleasing for decades this report includes a discussion of the effects of outdoor exposure on wood characteristics of wr and wrp formulations and methods for applying wrs and wrps effects of outdoor exposure properly seasoned wood that stays dry is not subject to decay premature failure of paints and finishes and problems associated with weathering such as excessive splitting and checking raised grain extractive bleed and discoloration moisture effects water is one of woods worst enemies whether in the form of vapor or liquid water can cause shrinking and swelling which can lead to dimensional changes of the wood and degradation of the finish water causes decay or rot of the wood and early failure of paint and it accelerates the weathering of wood exposed outdoors shrinking and swelling  in general wood shrinks as it loses moisture and swells as it gains moisture more precisely wood changes dimension between an absolutely dry state completely free of moisture and its fiber saturation point the point at which the wood fibers are completely saturated with moisture this fiber saturation point typically occurs at about  moisture content for most species at this point all the woods water is bound within the cell wall at moisture content changes above fiber saturation the cell cavities take on or lose unbound water but the wood cell walls do not change dimensionally below the fiber saturation point however the wood will change dimension with changing moisture content the magnitude of this change is dependent on species and is always different for the three axes radial tangential and longitudinal a large percentage of wood finish degradation eg paint defects peeling and cracking results from moisture changes in the wood and subsequent dimensional instability water vaporwater effects  shrinking and swelling of wood occur whether the water is in the form of vapor or liquid for example wood swells during periods of high humidity and shrinks during periods of low humidity it also swells and shrinks as it gets wet from liquid water then dries as discussed wood can swell until it reaches fiber saturation if wood is exposed to water vapor such as occurs indoors the moisture content can only reach the fiber saturation point this requires exposure to  relative humidity for an extended period since wood is seldom exposed to this level of relative humidity for long periods it seldom reaches fiber saturation because of high humidity however if the wood gets wet from liquid water it can quickly reach or even go beyond fiber saturation problems with poor performance of wood occur when the moisture content of wood reaches or goes beyond fiber saturation  this is almost always caused by liquid water throughout the remainder of this report the term water refers only to liquid water water vapor to humidity and moisture to both water and water vapour weathering regardless of the care taken in building a structure wood ages when exposed outdoors this aging process is called weathering weathering is a degradation of the woods surface caused by the combined effects of the ultraviolet uv radiation in sunlight water and abrasion by windblown sand or other particulates this degradation should not be confused with decay weathering is first manifested by a change in the color of the wood the color of most preservativetreated lumber is either light green from copper and chromium salts in the preservative or brown from added dye cedar and redwood have the freshlysawn natural color of these species with weathering dark wood such as redwood and cedar tends to get lighter whereas light wood such as pine and fir tends to get darker in some climates such as along the seashore wood tends to weather to a silvery gray this color is a combination of mildew growth and cellulose enrichment of the surface the weathering process removes the colored extractives and lignin leaving cellulose if protected from excessive moisture redwood and cedar are prone to weather to silvergray wood that has been pressuretreated with cca but not treated with a wrp will initially turn to dull gray eventually this wood will also become silvergray the change in color is followed by a loosening of wood fibers and gradual erosion of the wood surface rain washes the degraded wood materials from the surface rain andor changes in humidity also cause dimensional changes in the wood that accelerate this erosion process erosion is more rapid in the less dense earlywood than in the latewood which leads to an uneven surface surface erosion however proceeds slowly the erosion rate for solid softwoods in temperate zones is on the order of  to  inch  to l mm per century and depends mainly on the intensity of uv radiation and on the wood species for hardwoods the erosion rate is  to  inch  to  mm per century the erosion rate depends on the exposure of the wood to sun and rain and the care the wood receives control of water absorption by the wood retards weathering and decay extractive bleed a common cause of discoloration is extractive bleed all species contain extractives but extractive bleed is more prevalent on highly colored woods the discoloration often occurs around fasteners because the hole in the wood caused by the fastener cuts many wood cells these cut cells increase water absorption water dissolves the extractives and when the wood dries the extractives accumulate at the surface and sunlight causes them to polymerize although extractive bleed can be a problem on wood siding it is seldom a problem on horizontal wood surfaces such as decks because the extractives are usually washed from the deck by rain before they polymerize if extractive bleed is a problem the extractives can be removed by scrubbing the wood with soap and water do not use a wire brush because the brush will contaminate the surface with iron which will cause iron stain finishing wood with a wrp greatly minimizes extractive bleed iron stain a common form of staining on wood surfaces resufts from contamination with iron a portion of the extractives in wood includes a group of chemicals collectively called tannins the amount of tannins depends on species oak redwood and cedar are rich in tannins tannins react with iron to form a blueblack stain on wood common causes of iron stain include use of ungalvanized or poorly galvanized fasteners cleaning with steel wool andor wire brush and contact of the wood with any iron or steel finishing wood with a wr or wrp greatly minimizes iron stain removal of iron stain iron stain can be removed by scrubbing the stained area with a aqueous solution of oxalic acid in water oxalic acid is usually sold at drugstores and hardware stores dissolve  to  oz of oxalic acid in  qt of hot water scrub stained area using a stiffbristle brush thoroughly rinse with water after treatment note  qt  liter  oz  g caution oxalic acid is toxic wear rubber gloves and avoid contact with skin work in a well ventilated area avoid splashing the solution on plants because it can damage the foliage wash hands before eating andor using tobacco products store in locked space outofreach of children raised grain the wetting and drying cycle of wood exposed outdoors can raise the grain of the wood resulting in a rough surface on flatgrained lumber the raised grain may appear as thin knife like feathers along the earlywoodlatewood interface this degradation leads to a splintery wood surface and eventually to checking and cracking checking may increase the uptake of water thus accelerating the degradation process decay whereas weathering is degradation of the wood surface decay also called rot affects the full volume of wood decay is degradation caused by a variety of decay fungi that are capable of breaking down the structural components of wood for food the fungi tunnel throughout the full volume of the wood degrading the polymers that form the wood cells through a complicated biochemical process since these polymers give wood its strength considerable loss of strength occurs long before visible damage is apparent wood decay fungi must have adequate moisture to grow although the amount necessary for growth varies depending on the species of fungi in general the wood must be near fiber saturation for fungal growth mildew mildew is caused by a type of stain fungi which differ from decay fungi mildew is not capable of degrading the structural components of wood therefore it does not cause a decrease in wood strength unlike decay fungi mildew fungi do not tunnel through the wood but live only on the surface like decay fungi mildew fungi often flourish when excessive water is present moisture also encourages the growth of lichens and other microorganisms that discolor the wood surface wood can develop mildew growth rapidly particulariy if treated with linseed oi or other natural oils which form a food source for the fungi because the conditions that favor the growth of mildew fungi also favor the growth of wooddegrading fungi be suspicious if wood has mildew or other discoloration mildew can affect all species of wood including naturally decayresistant species and wood treated with cca some extractives are food for mildew thus species with high extractives content are slightly more susceptible to discoloration by mildew mildew fungi are objectionable because they discolor the wood the most common discoloration is an overall gray mildew can also appear as black blotchy stains mildew can be removed with a liquid household bleachwater solution better yet periodic treatment of the wood with a wrp can prevent mildew advantages of waterrepellent preservatives retard decay in aboveground applications decrease raised grain checking warping and splitting inhibit mildew growth on both painted and unpainted wood retard iron stain stop extractive bleed improve paint adhesion wrwrp formulations water repellents and wrps are relatively simple wood treatments that slow the uptake of water and help keep wood dry the only difference between these preservatives is that wrps include a fungicide or mildewcide otherwise the composition of wrs and wrps is similar both contain  binder such as varnish resin or drying oil linseed or tung oil a solvent and a substance that repels water usually a wax the oil or varnish resin penetrates the wood surface and cures to partially seal the wood surface the oil or varnish also helps to bind the fungicidemildewcide and water repellent to the wood surface solvents include organic liquids such as turpentine naphtha and mineral spirits or water the amount of water repellent varies among brands some wrs and wrps are formulated with a low concentration of water repellent so that they can be used as a pretreatment for other finishes about   by volume others are formulated with a high concentration of water repellent about  by volume and are meant to be used as standalone finishes preservatives the chemical preservatives used in wrps deserve special mention they should not be confused with the preservatives used for pressure treating wood such as oca the term preservative is used because the wrp chemical is a registered pesticide these preservatives are moderately effective fungicidesmildewcides and give some decay resistance to wood in aboveground exposure the chemical treatments described here are contained in the finish and are formulated for brush application they are not available except as formulated in a finish commonly available preservatives are described in the following list iodopropynyl butyl carbamate commonly called polyphase is currently used in several commercial wrp formulations and pigmented stains it is available in both solvent and waterborne systems at approximately  composition by weight thiocyanomethylthio benzothiazole tcmtb is used alone or in combination with methylene bis thiocyanate mtc or mtb this preservative can also be effective as a fungicide for wrp and stain formulations it is available in both solvent and waterborne systems at approximately  composition by weight zinc naphthenate is available commercially in wrp formulations and possibly in some new stains in both solvent and waterborne formulations approximately  concentration by weight of zinc metal is recommended copper naphthenate is available commercially in wrps solutions and treated wood are bright green treated wood weathers to pale greenbrown in full sunlight this preservative is available in solvent and waterborne formulations at approximately  concentration by weight of copper metal it is one of the few fungicides used to pressuretreat wood for belowground decay resistance it is very effective for use on cut ends of posts before being placed in the ground copperquinollnolate is available in commercial wrps and may be available in stains this preservative imparts a greenbrown color to the wood effective concentrations range from  to  a mixture of bis tributyltin oxide and ntrlchloromethylthlo phthallmlde the latter also commonly called folpet is in a number of commercial stain formulations at  to  composition by weight pentachlorophenol penta was used quite extensively in wrp formulations until about  it is no longer readily available to the consumer in either the readytouse  penta or the concentrated  penta formulation because of its high toxicity and status as a carcinogen the use of pentachlorophenol is controlled and restricted to registered pesticide applicators some european commercial formulations available in the united states may contain preservatives other than those listed here treatments containing borates are also being marketed as preservatives for wood products the word preservative is a general term that includes many different chemicals used on wood to make it less susceptible to attack from a variety of organisms these organisms include fungi of various types including stain and decay fungi insects and marine borers some of these chemicals are effective against a range of organisms others are very specific and protect wood from only one type of organism no single chemical will protect wood from all degrading organisms terms often used interchangeably with preservative include pesticide fungicide insecticide and mildewcide these chemicals are all preservatives but they protect wood from specific organisms fungicides protect wood from wooddegrading fungi many fungicides will also protect wood against mildew in turn mildewcides can sometimes provide protection against decay fungi but they are most effective against mildew and similar staining fungi the chemicals used to formulate wrps are generally fungicides and impart resistance to both mildew and decay fungi changes in wr and wrp formulations penetrating finishes were traditionally formulated using organic solvents as carriers for the binder and water repellent the organic solvents facilitated the absorption of these components thus giving a penetrating finish the formulations were relatively simple solutions of binder wax and fungicide about  wrp formulations started to change because of concerns about solvent evaporation from these finishes in urban areas with smog a number of waterborne formulations were introduced in addition several manufacturers began marketing low volatile organic compound voc formulations for use in some areas voc is a general term for volatile solvents and cosolvents used in both solvent and waterborne finishes several areas in the united states have legislation in place or pending that will limit voc levels in architectural finishes recent legislation in california arizona texas new york new jersey and several other states has restricted the amount of organic solvent used in finishes this legislation has had the greatest effect on the formulation of penetrating finishes such as wrs wrps and semitransparent stains under provisions of the new clean air act  more stringent regulations that will affect paint formulations are currently being developed formulations of finishes will continue to change to meet these regulations the restriction of solvents has caused manufacturers to reformulate penetrating finishes by either removing solvents to give highsolid finishes or by relying on waterborne systems penetrating characteristics of wrp formulations there is considerable variation in the penetrating characteristics of waterborne formulations many waterborne formulations absorb into the wood in the same way as solventborne formulations but others tend to form thin surface films the manufacturers product literature may indicate the absorption characteristics of the finish in highsolid formulations containing large amounts of natural or synthetic oils the proper absorption of the finish can be hampered by the sheer volume of oil on the surface if the oil is a drying oil it may dry before absorbing into dense areas such as wide latewood bands on flat sawn lumber the resulting film will appear as shiny areas on the surface some wrps are formulated with nondrying oils that act as solvents such as paraffin oil these oils penetrate the wood but do not dry they protect the wood from degradation and mildew attack as do other types of wrps since the oils do not dry the wood surface may remain oily until the finish absorbs absorption usually takes several days depending on the application rate and porosity of the wood since the oil does not dry there is the possibility of tracking it indoors if this finish is used on decks these products are easy to apply to decks and have about the same durability as other penetrating clear finishes preparation of wrps directions for mixing a wrp were published in a research note in  this formulation was once possible because of the availability of pentachlorophenol penta this pesticide is no longer available to the consumer in addition the fungicides listed in this research note are usually unavailable therefore it is not possible to mix your own wrp resistance to decay and mildew water repellents and wrps are effective when used on wood exposed outdoors aboveground in areas where decay is a serious problem or where wood will be in contact with the ground wood foundations or fence posts for example wood will need far more protection than that afforded by surface treatment with a wr or wrp in such cases wood properly protected by treatment with a commercial preservative is recommended such pressuretreated wood is normally available at a lumber yard and should conform to recognized standards for maximum service life for naturally decayresistant wood species wrps provide mildew resistance for both the heartwood and sapwood if the lumber contains portions of sapwood treatment with a wrp is essential to provide aboveground decay resistance treatment with cca provides resistance to decay only not mildew treatment of the preservativetreated wood with a wpr provides resistance to mildew the wrps also provide aboveground decay resistance for either sections of the wood that did not take the preservative treatment heartwood or the interior of large crosssections exposed by cutting or drilling a number of commercial wood treaters are using a combined wrcca treatment for  x  in radius  x  mm edged decking this lumber is marketed under trade names such as ultrawood wolman extra melco and weathershield this dual treatment gives the wood more resistance to weathering since the process is quite new the durability of the wr treatment is not yet wellestablished although the wr is supposed to thoroughly saturate the wood the wood may nevertheless require periodic maintenance with a wrp in addition the commercial preservative treatments do not contain a mildewcide so added treatment with a wrp is necessary to prevent mildew growth of the treated wood currently available these treatments should improve the wood characteristics and extend the product service life particularly with regard to weathering ie surface checking cracking splitting and erosion safety care should always be exercised in applying a wr or wrp the solventborne formulations are volatile flammable mixtures do not breathe their vapors or expose the solutions to flame or sparks it is wise to wear protective clothing on the hands and arms and to take care that the solution is not splashed in the eyes or on the face be especially careful using a wrp because these solutions contain fungicides some of which are toxic if rags paper towels and uncleaned brushes andlor rollers containing finishes are not disposed of properly they can spontaneously ignite store finishes in original containers under lock and key out of reach of children and pets and away from foodstuff use all finishes selectively and carefully follow recommended practices for the disposal of surplus preservatives and preservative containers immerse finishcontaminated materials in water then seal in plastic or an empty paint can until they can be disposed of by proper incineration or burying caution wood preservatives can be injurious to people animals and plants therefore for safe and effective usage it is essential to follow the directions and heed all precautions on container labels the application of preservatives using any spray method can be especially hazardous and extra precautions must be taken avoid spraying whenever possible do not use any preservatives indoors unless they have been specifically approved and recommended for such use application of finish a wr or wrp can be applied to all exterior wood that is normally painted it can be used as a pretreatment for paint or as a standalone finish the standalone finishes generally have a higher wax content if you use a wr or wrp as a pretreatment for paint be sure to read the manufacturers recommendations not all wrs and wrps can be used as prefreatments for paints waterrepellent preservatives are usually intended for exterior use because the preservatives or fungicides in them are toxic to humans animals and plants solvents and other additives may also be harmful it is important to read the label on the original container carefully to determine if the material is allowed and recommended for indoor use when in doubt consult the manufacturer to determine which fungicide was used in the wrp and whether it is appropriate for your proposed use be sure to follow the manufactures directions for temperature limitations because finishes do not cure properly if the temperature is too low procedures for unpainted wood water repellents and wrps can be applied to wood by brush roller or spray or the wood can be dipped into the finish a wrp can be used as a natural finish on many wood species to help maintain their natural appearance for example finishing western redcedar with a wrp brings out the goldentan color of the wood this finish is not recommended for exterior or brushed plywood however it is very useful for low grades of lumber that do not hold paint well treatment with a wr or wrp will be more durable on weathered or roughsawn surfaces because such surfaces absorb a greater quantity of the finish than does a smooth surface during the first few years of exposure the natural color of the wood can be partially restored by scrubbing the surface with a wood brightenerwater mixture such as aqueous solutions of household bleach or oxalic acid or a commercial wood cleaner scrub the wood with a stiff bristle brush and rinse thoroughly with water allow the wood to dry for several days before refinishing however if the wood has been exposed for several years without a finish it may not be possible to restore the wood to its original color using a wood brightener may return some original color and remove the mildew the amount of color that returns depends on how much the surface has weathered regardless of whether the wood is unfinished or finished particular care should be taken to apply a liberal amount of the wr or wrp to the ends of boards at joints between boards and to all newly exposed wood such as drill holes capillary flow will cause water to climb the back of bevel siding from the lap joints this flow of water can be prevented by applying wr or wrp to the lap joints in addition the finish should be applied to the butt ends of horizontal siding edges and top and bottom ends of vertical siding and edges and corner joints in window sash sills window frames doors and door frames bottoms of doors and window sash are often overlooked these are areas where water can penetrate deeply and cause extensive damage if the wood is not treated treatment with a wr or wrp will eliminate many such problems  new woodapplying wr or wrp solution to the surface of unfinished wood by brushing or dipping is an effective treatrnent for siding and exterior millwork doors window sash door and window frames sills moldings and fascia wood fencing and lawn furniture millwork is often dipped in a wrp during manufacture to improve its durability if treated millwork has been purchased only freshly cut surfaces need to be brush or diptreated dipping is more effective care should be taken to treat ends of boards and joints between boards reflnishingthe weathering of wood finished with wrs and wrps is similar to that of unfinished wood the surface of the wood degrades but at a slower rate than that of unfinished wood timely refinishing is essential to avoid excessive wood degradation smoothly planed wood surfaces often require cleaning and retreatment after the first year of exposure after this maintenance refinishing is required only when the surface starts to show uneven discoloration or small black spots which indicate mildew   specific applications decksa wrp is an effective finish for a fully exposed deck although the deck will need to be refinished frequently there is no need for laborious surface preparation as is required by filmforming finishes annual refinishing can be done quickly using a brush roller or pad brush application works the finish into the wood better than do the other methods the finish should be applied liberally to decayprone areas around fasteners and endgrain treated woodwood that has been pressurereated with waterborne chemicals such as cm can easily be finished with a wrp if the wood is clean and reasonably dry if the wood is still waterlogged from the preservative treatment it should be allowed to dry for several days once the structure is built during summer weather conditions this is usually enough time for the wood to dry sufliciently to accept a wrp marine usesdocks and similar structures in marine environments are particularly susceptible to rapid weathering and decay treatment with a wrp helps preserve wood in this environment fenceslike decks fences are fully exposed to the weather many fences are left to weather naturally if a finish is desirable a penetrating finish such as a wrp or semitransparent stain that contains a mildewcide should be used periodic treatment with a wrp can slow weathering and decay thus prolonging the life of the fence in addition a wrp will preserve the natural weathered appearance of the wood roofsalthough wood shingles and shakes on standard buildings have been replaced by composition and asphaltbased shingles to a great extent their use is still widespread in certain areas of the country and on expensive homes wood shakes and shingles are often left to weather naturally if they are made from durable species such as western redcedar depending on exposure and climate conditions the wood generally turns silver dark gray or dark brown however in warm humid climates common to the southern united states and on heavily shaded roofs mildew moss and lichens can occur these conditions are also conducive to decay a wrp protects the wood while preserving the natural appearance it is best to diptreat the shakes or shingles before they are installed so that the backs and buttends absorb the finish the finish may be applied by dipping the shingles to at least twothirds their length and then letting them stand vertically until the finish has dried pretreatments for painted wood new woodwater repellent and wrp formulations for use as pretreatments for paint have less wax or other water repellents compared with those formulated for use without paint when used as a pretreatment before painting a wrp can be applied in the same way as when used as a natural finish freshly treated wood must be allowed to dry if the treatment is applied with a brush allow  days of drying in warm weather before painting if the wood is dipped for  or more seconds  week of drying is necessary before painting if enough time is not allowed for most of the solvent to dry from the wood and for the wax to absorb the paint applied over the treated wood may not cure or bond properly open joints such as in siding miliwork and facia should be caulked after treating with a wr or wrp but before priming refinishingwhen applying a wr or wrp to previously painted wood loose paint must be removed the wr or wrp should be brushed into the joints and unpainted areas remove excess wrp from the painted surfaces with a rag allow  days of drying in warm weather before repainting removal of mold and mildew if mildew is present pretreat the wood with a commercial cleaner or a chlorine bleachwater solution allow the wood to dry for  or  days before refinishing removal of mildew commercially available wood cleaners work quite effectively to remove midew and other stains on wood a mildew cleaner can also be made by dissolving  part liquid bleach and some powdered detergent in  to  parts water suggested formula  cup household detergent  quart  sodium hypochlorite household bleach  quarts warm water note  cup  liter  quart  liter caution do not use a detergent that contains ammonia ammonia reacts with bleach to form a poisonous gas many liquid detergents may contain other additives that react with chlorine containing bleach service life the service life of wrs and wrps is about  year on exposed wood surfaces however wrps are extremely easy to reapply to some structures such as decks water repellents and wrps absorb readily into the endgrain of lumber and can stop water absorption for many years the effectiveness of pretreatment of millwork with a wr or wrp has been confirmed in outdoor exposure studies the differences between wrptreated and untreated window sash and frames are significant after exposure for  years the window sash had been dipped in a wrp for  mm this treatment is similar to those used by most millwork manufacturers window units treated with only a wr were in reasonable condition window units treated with a wrp having extra high water repellency had the best durability the combined effect of a preservative and a good water repellent was the crucial factor for longterm durability untreated window units decayed severely and actually fell from the test fence after only  years of exposure     our private policy for your protection copyright  master garden

regulations guide to groundwater protection regulations the department’s groundwater protection regulations are intended to prevent contamination of public drinking water supply wells through regulating the application of pesticide products on the groundwater protection list within primary recharge areas a primary recharge area is either an “interim wellhead protection area” or a “zone ii ” the following stepbystep approach should enable applicators to determine if they need to comply with the regulations step one are you using a product which contains an active ingredient on the groundwater protection list the groundwater protection regulations apply only to pesticides which are on the groundwater protection list the list is maintained on the department of agricultural resources website if the active ingredient is listed the applicator must then establish if the pesticide application is to be made in a regulated primary recharge areastep two are you applying a product which is listed on the groundwater protection list withina regulated primary recharge area the pesticide groundwater protection regulations only apply to regulated primary recharge areas designated as a zone ii or an interim wellhead protection area iwpa by the massachusetts department of environmental protection massdep to establish if you are in a regulated primary recharge area you will need to follow the approach outlined in the following sectionhow to establish the location of a regulated primary recharge area zone ii or iwpaa check to see if the town where the application is to be made is featured on the zone ii list this list provides information about towns where there are zone iis areas for wells that have a pumping rate greater than  gallons per day if the town is not listed on the wellhead protection list you can proceed with the applicationif there is a zone ii delineated within the town you need to determine if the application site falls within the zone ii by clicking on the town this will take you to a map of the town with the recharge areas delineated you can zoom in on the areas for more details follow this link to the zone ii listb if the details provided in the zone ii list maps are not sufficiently clear in order for you to determine the location of your application you should use the states mass gis online data viewer system this section option allows users to overlay aerial photographs with various other data layers including zone ii areas and iwpas you should be comfortable with computer use if you follow this route follow this link to the data viewerc traditional optionsif you do not have internet accesscheck with the local water department for a source water assessment plan swap map which will show all zone iischeck with the local board of health for the title  maps which were updated in check with the regional dep office dep western regional office dep central regional office dep southeast regional office if your area of application is located with the primary recharge area you must determine if you are applying to an area with less than  foliar ground cover or greater than  foliar ground cover proceed to step step three are you applying pesticides in an area which has greater or less than a  foliar cover to apply a pesticide which is listed on the groundwater protection list within a zone ii or iwpa which is permitted to pump greater than gpd the applicator must distinguish between the following application scenarios and decide which scenario best applies a for a pesticide product which is applied to an area which has greater than  foliar ground cover the applicator must ensure thatthere is no viable alternative to the use of the pesticide andthe pesticide is being applied as part of an integrated pest management ipm program from department approved sources andthe department of agricultural resources is notified of any applications of a product on the groundwater protection list within ten days of the end of the calendar month in which the pesticide is appliedb for a pesticide product which is soil applied or applied to an area with less than  foliar ground cover the applicator must ensure that there is no viable alternative to the use of the pesticide andthe pesticide is being applied as part of an integrated pest management ipm program from department approved sources anda pesticide
