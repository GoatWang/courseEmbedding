group ltd otcmvtg the “company” announces a new master services agreement with a telecommunications carrier for the use of its drone mapping services while the contract is of indeterminate value the company recently received its first purchase order and the use of the product is expected to begin immediately roger ponder ceo stated through our subsidiary aw solutions we have developed a new cuttingedge technology that is industry leading for the remote mapping and measuring of elevated infrastructure utilizing uav unmanned aerial vehicles or drones the current level of accuracy utilizing existing technology is in excess of  of an inch which does not allow the utilization of the data collected for a structural analysis to take place aw solutions now can to obtain accuracies superior to th of an inch which is the minimum threshold” “this technology has already been field tested in a live environment and now we have executed master service agreements msa’s with major carriers and tower aggregators for tower mapping and analysis services and also visual observations on environmentally sensitive sites where protected species are present” roger ponder goes on to say “while our initial rollout is focused on telecommunications towers and antenna mounting structures this drone technology is also applicable in many other industries including oil  gas transportation  shipping commercial construction military and any industry where structures need physical measurements taken which will provide our company with additional revenue streams through the use of remote sensing it mitigates the need for people to climb and measure structures and therefore is a safety multiplier for the work environment that reduces risk exposures to workers businesses and the public”    about
