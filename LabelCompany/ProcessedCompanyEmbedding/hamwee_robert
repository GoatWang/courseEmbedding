snapshotargentina is not a land of palm trees and tropical beaches as most images of south america portray associating a latin american country with skiing and cold winters as well as hot and humid summers might seem odd but this is only one of the many aspects that gives this country its own standing as an exciting inviting and unforgettable place to visit be it for business or

heavy snowfalls during winter it is in this area where you can find the foot meter mount aconcagua the highest peak in the andes range and indeed in south americafurther south lies patagonia where the landscape features lakes forests and sharp mountain peaks near the andes in the west very reminiscent of an alpine scene and a vast semideserted plain as you travel east toward the atlantic ocean as

the west of the country running along the andes from the province of mendoza through neuquén rio negro chubut and santa cruz all the way down south to tierra del fuego heavy snowfalls and subzero temperatures in winter provide the ideal conditions for winter sports it is here where argentinas ski resorts can be found ranging from important international centers to smaller local onesthe argentinians a very mixed bagmany cultures have helped to shape argentinas society into one that differentiates itself very prominently from the rest of latin america the british spanish italians germans french and most recently koreans have found a home in argentina the extent to which these groups mostly of european origin are represented varies in number but they make up  percent of the populationon the other hand afroargentinians constitute a very small minority despite slavery having been no less prevalent in argentina than in other countries until the early nineteenth century the black community represents less than  percent of the overall population the same applies to other ethnic minorities such as descendants of the original amerindian tribesthe italians and spanishargentina has witnessed great waves of immigrants throughout its history the spanish and italians were by far the largest groups to seek new fortunes in the new world and evidence of this is very strong in everyday life a large proportion of surnames in argentina are either italian or spanish even local slang incorporates some italian words unsurprisingly many of these communities have not developed in the same way as their european counterparts the italians perhaps remaining more italian than their ancestors back home and likewise the spanish this is possibly a result of being cut off from their roots and of not being exposed to those common external factors that have molded other societies over the yearsthe first and second generations who arrived in argentina still spoke their ancestors language and many of them spoke spanish with a heavy accent particularly the galician community as subsequent generations were born and educated in argentina and older generations passed away their original languages would no longer be spoken typical spanish names like pérez rodríguez and fernández are perhaps the most common surnames in argentina the italians and spanish brought with them strong catholic sensibilities and a firm sense of family unity that to this day remains at the heart of argentinian valuesthe english the scots and the welshthe small british community holds an important place within argentinian society in areas such as commerce trade and industry the british in argentina have retained a strong identity although they have become well integrated into argentinian society they were instrumental in the development of argentinas large railway network — the opportunities for employment and the skills required opened the doors to a wave of immigrants from britaindespite a brief period of low popularity during the falklands war in  the british community continues to be represented and respected across the country it has grown over the years settling in many areas of the country most of them in the capital but also in cities like la cumbre in the province of córdobasince the early nineteenth century scots welsh and english have arrived on the coasts of the river plate establishing closely knit communities and founding schools churches and businesses many of which are still there to this day their influence is still evident in placenames such as temperley wilde and hurlingham traditional private english schools are still favored by many as a paragon of good educationcaledonian balls bagpipes and kilts are still very much part of life for the scottish community who continue to make their mark ever since the arrival of scottish settlers in the s these traditions have been perpetuated through the st andrews community of the river plate until the mids there was even a harrods outlet in buenos aires which although not officially a branch of the famous london store had the same logo and corporate branding today large shops like james smart and wrights are flagships of british influence in argentinathe welsh arrived in patagonia in  and settled in the province of chubut mainly driven by the search for economic prosperity they agreed to respect the laws of the country in exchange for land and respect for their own language and customs welsh tea houses music and poetry festivals as well as the welsh language are still very much part of this communityon the sports front rugby golf tennis and polo are great icons of the british presencea brief historythe name argentina derives from the word argentum the latin for silver the name was coined by the spanish conquistadores who believed in the existence of large treasures in the area they discovered upon their arrival in the early part of the sixteenth century the river plate is in fact a mistranslation of río de la plata whose literal rather than phonetic translation is river of silver plata being the spanish word for the precious metal argentina was a spanish colony until it gained its independence on july  early inhabitantsdue to its vast area and marked variation in both climate and geographic features many different amerindians inhabited argentina in the early days much of the influence of these early inhabitants extended well beyond the borders of argentina as we know them today it is not surprising to see that so many centuries later certain features and traditions are shared between those living in areas near the borders with argentinas neighboring countries these cultures and idiosyncrasies developed as a result of being faced with similar challenges so commonalities can be found between indigenous inhabitants of the andean region of northwest argentina stretching from the province of córdoba all the way to the provinces of salta and jujuy and their neighbors across the borders in the bolivian chilean and peruvian andes where climate and landscape are very similar patagonia was mainly inhabited by the yaganes and the onas or patagonesthe spanish conquistadoreswhen the spanish arrived on what is now argentinian soil they found a country that was very sparsely populated the estuary of the river plate all the way up to paraguay was inhabited by over fifteen different tribes among them the tupíguaraníes querandíes and mocoretásthe regions of chaco to the northwest of argentina and the pampas in the center were inhabited by tribes originally from the western part of the country near the border with chile among these tribes are the ranqueles the puelches and the pampas who migrated eastward in search of fertile land eventually settling in the area known as the pampas which includes the province of the same name this is the main and richest agricultural part of argentina these tribes were the ones who after years of contact with the spanish conquistadores in the sixteenth century developed into what are known as the gauchos later spreading to other parts of the country and adapting their ways and customs to the local environment the gauchos however are indigenous to the pampas they were nomadic herdsmen mainly making a living by cleaning and preparing leather for the manufacture of goods leather was the gauchos main source of income as meat had little commercial value in those days due to its abundant supply for such a small population the fact that it could not be kept for long periods and the nonexistence of any kind of export logistics although considered as no more than nomadic travelers in their early days the gauchos have become one of the legendary symbols of argentinian culture and tradition portrayed as the essence of the argentinian character in many literary works one of the most renowned being martín fierro by the nineteenthcentury poet josé hernándezargentina was officially discovered in  by the spanish navigator juan díaz de solís although many writers attribute its discovery to a florentine explorer by the name of amerigo vespucci américo vespucio in spanish in  vespucci was the first to claim that the newly discovered continent was not part of asia as originally thought the mapmaker martin waldseemuller bestowed upon him rather than columbus the title of discoverer of america and so named the continent after him vespucci died of malaria two years before solís arrived at the estuary of the river platethe white kingthe quest to find a passage connecting the atlantic and pacific oceans dates as far back as the days of the first conquistadores solís tried unsuccessfully to find a route by sailing up the river plate which he had initially called mar dulce sweet water sea but it was not until four years later in  that fernando de magallanes magellan achieved this by venturing south down the coast of argentina and passing through the strait that bears his name solís was ambushed and killed by querandí or guaraní indians in  upon his death the rest of his crew decided to return to spain not all of them reaching their homeland as many were shipwrecked or captured by indiansamong those shipwrecked was a portuguese sailor by the name of alejo garcía who had found refuge on the island of santa catalina off the coast of brazil like many of his fellow sailors in the same predicament he had heard from the indians on the nearby brazilian coast of the existence of a king a sovereign of immensely rich lands to the west according to the indians the abundance of gold in this kingdom was such that even the houses were built with it this monarch according to the locals was not of dark skin but more like their conquerors thus the legend of the white king was bornspains thirst for conquest of the americas continued during the reign of charles v charles i of spain and later crowned charles v holy roman emperor in  he sent his pilotmajor sebastian caboto cabot to explore the river plate the fort of sancti spiritu that he founded in  near modern rosario is considered to be the first spanish settlement in argentinathe birth of a capitalin  pedro de mendoza arrived at the river plate the purpose of his trip was threefold — to find the treasures of these new lands to prevent portuguese incursions into the territories and to evangelize the native indians in february of that year he founded the city of puerto de nuestra señora santa maría del buen aire nowadays known as buenos aires the name was given as an invocation of the virgin mary a custom that had originated in cagliari sardinia which in those days belonged to spain invocation of the virgin for protection from the dangers of the sea was common practice among sailors of the mediterraneanthe initial coexistence of the amerindians and the conquistadores was a peaceful one with the native indians supplying food in exchange for goods this however was not to last the amerindians became hostile and mendoza was forced to sail up the coast of brazil and the paraná river in search of food mendozas brother diego de mendoza remained behind and he and those who stayed with him were attacked by over one thousand native indians the confrontation that ensued the battle of corpus christi resulted in the death of many spaniards

argentinas society into one that differentiates itself very prominently from the rest of latin america the british spanish italians germans french and most recently koreans have found a home in argentina the extent to which these groups mostly of european origin are represented varies in number but they make up  percent of the populationon the other hand afroargentinians constitute a very small minority despite slavery having been no less prevalent in argentina than in other countries until the early nineteenth century the black community represents less than  percent of the overall population the same applies to other ethnic minorities such as descendants of the original amerindian tribesthe italians and spanishargentina has witnessed great waves of immigrants throughout its history the spanish and italians were by far the largest groups to seek new fortunes in the new world and evidence of this is very strong in everyday life a large proportion of surnames in argentina are either italian or spanish even local slang incorporates some italian words unsurprisingly many of these communities have not developed in the same way as their european counterparts the italians perhaps remaining more italian than their ancestors back home and likewise the spanish this is possibly a result of being cut off from their roots and of not being exposed to those common external factors that have molded other societies over the yearsthe first and second generations who arrived in argentina still spoke their ancestors language and many of them spoke spanish with a heavy accent particularly the galician community as subsequent generations were born and educated in argentina and older generations passed away their original languages would no longer be spoken typical spanish names like pérez rodríguez and fernández are perhaps the most common surnames in argentina the italians and spanish brought with them strong catholic sensibilities and a firm sense of family unity that to this day remains at the heart of argentinian valuesthe english the scots and the welshthe small british community holds an important place within argentinian society in areas such as commerce trade and industry the british in argentina have retained a strong identity although they have become well integrated into argentinian society they were instrumental in the development of argentinas large railway network — the opportunities for employment and the skills required opened the doors to a wave of immigrants from britaindespite a brief period of low popularity during the falklands war in  the british community continues to be represented and respected across the country it has grown over the years settling in many areas of the country most of them in the capital but also in cities like la cumbre in the province of córdobasince the early nineteenth century scots welsh and english have arrived on the coasts of the river plate establishing closely knit communities and founding schools churches and businesses many of which are still there to this day their influence is still evident in placenames such as temperley wilde and hurlingham traditional private english schools are still favored by many as a paragon of good educationcaledonian balls bagpipes and kilts are still very much part of life for the scottish community who continue to make their mark ever since the arrival of scottish settlers in the s these traditions have been perpetuated through the st andrews community of the river plate until the mids there was even a harrods outlet in buenos aires which although not officially a branch of the famous london store had the same logo and corporate branding today large shops like james smart and wrights are flagships of british influence in argentinathe welsh arrived in patagonia in  and settled in the province of chubut mainly driven by the search for economic prosperity they agreed to respect the laws of the country in exchange for land and respect for their own language and customs welsh tea houses music and poetry festivals as well as the welsh language are still very much part of this communityon the sports front rugby golf tennis and polo are great icons of the british presencea brief historythe name argentina derives from the word argentum the latin for silver the name was coined by the spanish conquistadores who believed in the existence of large treasures in the area they discovered upon their arrival in the early part of the sixteenth century the river plate is in fact a mistranslation of río de la plata whose literal rather than phonetic translation is river of silver plata being the spanish word for the precious metal argentina was a spanish colony until it gained its independence on july  early inhabitantsdue to its vast area and marked variation in both climate and geographic features many different amerindians inhabited argentina in the early days much of the influence of these early inhabitants extended well beyond the borders of argentina as we know them today it is not surprising to see that so many centuries later certain features and traditions are shared between those living in areas near the borders with argentinas neighboring countries these cultures and idiosyncrasies developed as a result of being faced with similar challenges so commonalities can be found between indigenous inhabitants of the andean region of northwest argentina stretching from the province of córdoba all the way to the provinces of salta and jujuy and their neighbors across the borders in the bolivian chilean and peruvian andes where climate and landscape are very similar patagonia was mainly inhabited by the yaganes and the onas or patagonesthe spanish conquistadoreswhen the spanish arrived on what is now argentinian soil they found a country that was very sparsely populated the estuary of the river plate all the way up to paraguay was inhabited by over fifteen different tribes among them the tupíguaraníes querandíes and mocoretásthe regions of chaco to the northwest of argentina and the pampas in the center were inhabited by tribes originally from the western part of the country near the border with chile among these tribes are the ranqueles the puelches and the pampas who migrated eastward in search of fertile land eventually settling in the area known as the pampas which includes the province of the same name this is the main and richest agricultural part of argentina these tribes were the ones who after years of contact with the spanish conquistadores in the sixteenth century developed into what are known as the gauchos later spreading to other parts of the country and adapting their ways and customs to the local environment the gauchos however are indigenous to the pampas they were nomadic herdsmen mainly making a living by cleaning and preparing leather for the manufacture of goods leather was the gauchos main source of income as meat had little commercial value in those days due to its abundant supply for such a small population the fact that it could not be kept for long periods and the nonexistence of any kind of export logistics although considered as no more than nomadic travelers in their early days the gauchos have become one of the legendary symbols of argentinian culture and tradition portrayed as the essence of the argentinian character in many literary works one of the most renowned being martín fierro by the nineteenthcentury poet josé hernándezargentina was officially discovered in  by the spanish navigator juan díaz de solís although many writers attribute its discovery to a florentine explorer by the name of amerigo vespucci américo vespucio in spanish in  vespucci was the first to claim that the newly discovered continent was not part of asia as originally thought the mapmaker martin waldseemuller bestowed upon him rather than columbus the title of discoverer of america and so named the continent after him vespucci died of malaria two years before solís arrived at the estuary of the river platethe white kingthe quest to find a passage connecting the atlantic and pacific oceans dates as far back as the days of the first conquistadores solís tried unsuccessfully to find a route by sailing up the river plate which he had initially called mar dulce sweet water sea but it was not until four years later in  that fernando de magallanes magellan achieved this by venturing south down the coast of argentina and passing through the strait that bears his name solís was ambushed and killed by querandí or guaraní indians in  upon his death the rest of his crew decided to return to spain not all of them reaching their homeland as many were shipwrecked or captured by indiansamong those shipwrecked was a portuguese sailor by the name of alejo garcía who had found refuge on the island of santa catalina off the coast of brazil like many of his fellow sailors in the same predicament he had heard from the indians on the nearby brazilian coast of the existence of a king a sovereign of immensely rich lands to the west according to the indians the abundance of gold in this kingdom was such that even the houses were built with it this monarch according to the locals was not of dark skin but more like their conquerors thus the legend of the white king was bornspains thirst for conquest of the americas continued during the reign of charles v charles i of spain and later crowned charles v holy roman emperor in  he sent his pilotmajor sebastian caboto cabot to explore the river plate the fort of sancti spiritu that he founded in  near modern rosario is considered to be the first spanish settlement in argentinathe birth of a capitalin  pedro de mendoza arrived at the river plate the purpose of his trip was threefold — to find the treasures of these new lands to prevent portuguese incursions into the territories and to evangelize the native indians in february of that year he founded the city of puerto de nuestra señora santa maría del buen aire nowadays known as buenos aires the name was given as an invocation of the virgin mary a custom that had originated in cagliari sardinia which in those days belonged to spain invocation of the virgin for protection from the dangers of the sea was common practice among sailors of the mediterraneanthe initial coexistence of the amerindians and the conquistadores was a peaceful one with the native indians supplying food in exchange for goods this however was not to last the amerindians became hostile and mendoza was forced to sail up the coast of brazil and the paraná river in search of food mendozas brother diego de mendoza remained behind and he and those who stayed with him were attacked by over one thousand native indians the confrontation that ensued the battle of corpus christi resulted in the death of many spaniards including diego de mendoza continues excerpted from argentina by robert
