ny slip op u decided on december   sur ct queens county kelly j published by new york state law reporting bureau pursuant to judiciary law §  this opinion is uncorrected and will not be published in the printed official reports decided on december   sur ct queens county in the matter of the accounting of joseph s parisi as executor of the estate of marie parisi deceased a the attorneys on this matter were gail goldfarb esq brian p flaherty esq attorneys for petitionerexecutor madeline s egelfeld esq gary b friedman esq attorneys for objectants peter j kelly j marie parisi died on january   she was survived by her husband joseph s parisi hereinafter joseph and three children michael parisi hereinafter michael camille parisi hereinafter camille and joseph m parisi hereinafter joe jr under the decedents will and codicil admitted to probate joseph was appointed the executor and the sole trustee of the family trust and the marital trust established therein in november  joseph filed the instant accounting as executor camille and joe jr filed objections thereto on november   joseph died and the executor of his estate michael was substituted as the petitioner in this proceeding objectant camille now moves for partial summary judgment on  of her  amended objections to the account seeking an order setting aside the december   sale of the decedents interest in white birch farms inc an order surcharging joseph  plus interest for failing to marshal the decedents onehalf interest in a promissory note an order surcharging joseph  plus interest for failing to marshal the proceeds of a mortgage which was satisfied prior to decedents death an order surcharging joseph  plus interest for the writeoff of the balance due from michael for the purchase of the decedents interest in white birch farms inc and a finding that joseph failed to invest the estates principal with due regard for the interests of the remaindermen and directing a hearing to determine damages petitioner crossmoves for summary judgment for an order declaring that the  mortgage and nonrecourse note secured by the mortgage passed to joseph as surviving tenant by the entirety pursuant to new jersey law objectant joe jr submitted an affidavit wherein he joins in the application of camille to set aside the sale of  shares of white farms inc to michael but objects to her application to surcharge joseph for failing to collect  on the note dated march   and joins in the crossmotion of michael to dismiss camilles objections thereto summary judgment may be granted only where it is clear that no triable issue of material fact exists see alvarez v prospect hosp  nyd  phillips v joseph kantor  co  nyd  to defeat a motion for summary judgment the opponent must assemble and lay bare affirmative proof to demonstrate the existence of a genuine triable issue of fact stainless inc v employers fire ins co  add  affd  nyd  allegations must be specific and detailed substantiated by evidence in the record mere conclusory assertions will not suffice iselin  co v mann judd landau  nyd  matter of newman  add  the papers submitted in support of and in opposition to the motion are scrutinized in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion if there is any doubt as to the existence of a triable issue of fact then the motion must be denied robinson v strong memorial hosp  add  initially the court will address the issues surrounding white birch farms inc specifically movants objections  and  at the time of her death decedent and her husband joseph each owned  shares of white birch farms inc hereinafter white birch on december   joseph as fiduciary sold the decedents  shares representing a  interest in the corporation to michael for  to be paid as follows  cash at closing and  per year for ten years joseph also obtained an appraisal of the corporation for estate tax purposes which indicated that the decedents onehalf interest therein was worth  subsequently and before his death joseph gifted the bulk of his own  shares of white birch to michael camille contends that josephs sale of decedents shares of white birch to his son constituted selfdealing and that therefore the transfer must be set aside where selfdealing is found the fairness or unfairness of the transaction is immaterial and not considered by the court see in re kilmer  misc  thus where a fiduciary has transferred estate or trust property to himself the court will not consider the fairness or unfairness of the transaction nor consider whether or not full consideration was paid such no further inquiry doctrine has also been applied where fiduciaries purchase indirectly by procuring a third person to purchase in the first instance later reaping an individual advantage from the transaction reynolds v aetna life ins co  ad  and where fiduciaries sell estate or trust property to their spouse in re fulton  ad  or a cotrustee in re estate of kinzler  add  camille citing in re estate of segal  misc  contends that the no further inquiry doctrine should apply to this transfer which was a transaction between the fiduciary and his son her reliance on segal however is misplaced since surrogate wingate did not apply the no further inquiry rule therein rather the court in segal held no sound distinction may be drawn between a conveyance of this variety to a person of the executors family who stands in a marital relationship to him and a like conveyance to a son or daughter as in the present case the transaction must be declared void at the election of the cestui que trust unless conclusively demonstrated to have been made for a full consideration under circumstances which preclude the possibility of any improper advantage to the individual fiduciary himself emphasis added  misc   while transactions with a child may put fiduciaries in conflict with certain beneficiaries the question remains whether this constitutes selfdealing this court has not found a case extending the no further inquiry doctrine to transactions with children and is loathe to broaden the per se rule to the fact pattern encountered at bar under the circumstances presented here the courts role should be to determine whether the fiduciary can conclusively demonstrate that the transaction was made for full consideration under circumstances which preclude the possibility of any improper advantage to the fiduciary based upon the facts set forth in the motion papers herein petitioner has sustained this burdenalthough camille does not concede that  was full consideration for the  shares of white birch farms inc she has not submitted proof in her motion papers that  was an undervaluation in fact the only evidence pertaining to the value of the stock submitted on the motion apart from pure conjecture was an appraisal camille annexed to her motion papers which indicated that the stock had a value of  which was the actual purchase price furthermore in the fifth branch of her motion camille seeks a surcharge in the sum of  which represents the difference between the  valuation and the amount subsequently collected by joseph from michael also as joseph later gifted the bulk of his shares of white birch farms inc to michael there doesnt appear to have been any improper advantage gained by the fiduciary in selling the decedents shares to michael for full consideration the court also notes that as set forth in segal supra the beneficiaries have two remedies available at their election if an illegal transfer takes place they may obtain a declaration that the transfer was void or in the alternative obtain from the fiduciary the difference between the consideration actually paid and the fair market value of the property at the time of the sale in her amended objections to account camille again only sought to request the difference between what michael actually paid and  a request for a declaration that the transfer was void was only raised in the instant motion accordingly the branch of the motion for an order setting aside the december   sale of the decedents interest in white birch farms inc to michael is denied and objections  and  are dismissed next the court turns to the branches of the motion for summary judgment on objections  and  by which the movants seek a surcharge against joseph in the amount of  as previously set forth on december   joseph sold the decedents  shares of white birch farms inc to michael for  to be paid as follows  cash at closing and  per year for ten years with interest at  per annum michael made three payments of  and on december   made an additional payment of  for a total sum paid of  which is  less than the contract price in schedule b of his accounting petitioner indicates that there was a writeoff in the sum of  due to decrease in market value of  shares of capital stock of white birch farms inc in his motion papers however petitioner claims that the sales price was overvalued because joseph only used a  lack of control discount instead of a  lack of control discount camille objected thereto and sought an order surcharging joseph the sum of  plus interest at  per annum from december   the date the balance due was forgiven as previously stated herein the only evidence submitted on the motion and crossmotion concerning the valuation of the capital stock of white birch farms inc was the appraisal setting forth the value of  and the memorandum of sale dated december   with that sales price any subsequent depreciation of value of the stock or realization by the fiduciary that the purchaser may have paid in excess of the market price is of no consequence as the fiduciary has a duty to the beneficiaries of the estate to sell the property at full market value and collect the full proceeds of any sale that is consummated accordingly objections  and  are sustained and the branch of the motion seeking an order surcharging joseph the sum of  plus interest is granted as follows joseph shall be surcharged the sum of  plus interest at the rate of  per annum from december   with respect to the branch of the motion addressing josephs failure to collect the proceeds of a promissory note as set forth in objection  on march   joe jr michael and the decedent acting as trustee for joe jr and michael executed a promissory note whereby they agreed to pay to joseph and the decedent the sum of  together with  interest thereon per annum due on march   the promissory note was secured by a mortgage assignment of leases and rents and a security agreement dated march   on real property in allentown monmouth county new jersey at the time the note and mortgage was signed decedent was married to joseph the note states that it was held by joseph s parisi and marie parisi or their heirs successors or assigns and the mortgage states that it was granted to joseph s parisi and marie parisi his wife the note provides as follows this note is to be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of new jersey without giving effect to new jerseys principles of conflicts of law the mortgage provides as follows section  the enforcement of this mortgage shall be governed construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state where the premises are located the instant accounting makes no mention of the decedents interest in this promissory note and camille seeks summary judgment based on the failure of the fiduciary to include the decedents onehalf interest in the note in his account camille citing miller v miller  nyd  contends that the note should be interpreted under new york law in miller the new york court of appeals quoting in re estate of clark  nyd  held that as between two states the law of that one which has the predominant if not the sole interest in the protection and regulation of the rights of the person or persons involved should of course be invoked camille contends that there is no question that the  notes most significant contacts are in new york state as all of the parties to the note resided in new york when it was executed the note was prepared by a new york law firm with offices on wall street the document was executed in new york and that the only connection to new jersey is the location of the land secured by the mortgage which she contends is incidental to the note since eptl §a provides that  a disposition of property to two or more persons creates in them a tenancy in common unless expressly declared to be a joint tenancy camille contends that applying new york law the decedent and joseph held the note as tenants in common and therefore decedents estate owns a onehalf interest in the note additionally camille argues that under eptl §a and eptl §a the decedents interest in the note is personal property and thus all issues concerning the character of same must be determined by a new york court petitioner on the other hand contends that the note and mortgage should be regarded as one and that the note clearly indicates thereon that it is secured by a mortgage on the property located at white birch farms in new jersey further the terms of the note revel that it is nonrecourse since there is no personal liability thereunder the only method to enforce the note is through foreclosure of the mortgage consequently the petitioner reasons that the note in and of itself has no value and thus the note and mortgage must be viewed together as without the note the mortgage is a nullity under new jersey law a tenancy by the entirety is created when a husband and wife take title to an interest in real or personal property under a written instrument designating both of their names as husband and wife  njsa § njsa § provides no instrument creating a property interest on the part of a husband and wife shall be construed to create a tenancy in common or joint tenancy unless it is expressed therein or manifestly appears from the tenor of the instrument that it was intended to create a tenancy in common or joint tenancy petitioner contends that since both the note and mortgage were held as tenants in the entirety under new jersey law upon the decedents death joseph became the sole owner of the note in his crossmotion petitioner seeks summary judgment declaring that the note passed to joseph as surviving tenant by the entirety pursuant to new jersey law the dispute presented herein is whether a note secured by a mortgage on real property located in new jersey is itself considered to be real property or personal property more fundamentally however an issue exists as to whether new york or new jersey law should be applied in determining this dispute eptl §b provides that the formal and intrinsic validity effect and manner in which real property devolves when not disposed of in a will is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the land is situated on the other hand disposition of personal property is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at death eptl §b however subdivision i of eptl § additionally states that notwithstanding the definition of real property in subparagraph a whether an estate in leasehold of fixture mortgage or other lien on land is real property governed by subparagraph b or personal property governed by subparagraph b is determined by the local law of the jurisdiction in which the land is situated interestingly while both parties have submitted detained analyses and arguments concerning which various provisions of the eptl govern in this instance scant attention has been given the terms of the note itself which specifically states it is to be construed and enforced according to the laws of new jersey courts will enforce a choice of law clause so long as the chosen law bears a reasonable relationship to the parties or transactions subject to certain exceptions that do not apply in this matter welsbach elec corp v mastec n am inc  nyd   no serious argument can be made that the controversy herein does not concern the construction of the instrument as personality or realty and there is no need to parse the agreement to ascertain that the clear intent of the parties was to have new jersey law apply in controlling this transaction despite the associated trappings concerning the place time and people involved in the drafting the note secondly while it is true that eptl § is clear on its face that a debt secured by a mortgage is personal property the court can not apply this statute unless it first finds it has subject matter jurisdiction to do so pursuant to eptl § under new jersey law where the subject of the security is land a mortgage debt although a chose in action is an interest in land and is treated as realty not personalty see burke v hoffman  nj  in new york a mortgage is an incident to the note and when the latter is transferred the mortgage is conveyed with the interest in the note conversely a mortgage is merely security for the note and can not exist independently see bank of ny v silverberg  add   however in this case the note is nonrecourse and can only be enforced through foreclosure upon the mortgage and the basis for the note was to memorialize the payment terms for real property located in new jersey in an analogous situation as presented here the appellate division second department was faced with an issue of whether income generated from new jersey realty should be considered real property or personal property applying new jersey law the court determined that the income was considered real property and therefore a new york court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to determine its distribution see matter of messaros  add  given the above factors even if the terms of the note were to be found not controlling as the note is considered an interest in realty under new jersey law and the real property in question is located in new jersey and finding the rationale of the messaros decision persuasive this court finds it is without jurisdiction to determine whether the note apparently valueless independently should be a personal asset of the decedents estate or a real property interest that passed to joseph by operation of law accordingly the branch of objectant camilles motion for summary judgment seeking a surcharge of  million from josephs estate and the crossmotion seeking a determination that the note passed by operation of law to joseph are both denied and camilles objection  is dismissed the next issue to be addressed is the branch of the motion seeking summary judgment pertaining to the permanent realty mortgage proceeds as contained in objection  on november   checks in the sums of  and  were issued by permanent realty corp payable to joseph and the decedent in full satisfaction of a mortgage both checks were deposited into josephs personal bank account in his name only on november   objectant camille contends that there is no indication that the decedents onehalf share of the mortgage proceeds  was marshaled by joseph petitioner contends that the deposit into josephs account was consistent with the pattern and practice by which joseph and the decedent had conducted their affairs for their entire married lives that joseph and the decedent did not maintain any joint bank accounts that joseph deposited money into the account that was then used for his own expenses the decedents expenses and their joint expenses petitioner contends that when the decedent died whatever amount remained in josephs account if any passed to joseph since it had been deposited by their common consent in an account in his name only essentially the petitioner claims the funds were gifted to joseph petitioner also submitted an affidavit by deborah a cox the property and leasing manager for m parisi  son construction co inc which indicates that she received the two certified checks and pursuant to the instructions from mr parisi joseph and as was our customary practice the funds were deposited in joseph s parisis bank account she further stated that joseph and the decedent did not maintain joint bank accounts and that joseph would deposit all incoming funds and earnings whether joint or not in his individual bank account one who attempts to establish title to property through an inter vivos gift as against the estate of a decedent must meet a heavy burden which he must support by evidence of great probative force which clearly establishes every element of a valid gift matter of kaminsky  add  the three essential elements of a gift donative intent delivery and acceptance must be established by clear and convincing evidence gruen v gruen  nyd  the evidence of gift taken as a whole must not be subject to any other interpretation such as a transfer for purposes of custody see frick v cone  misc  affd  ad  petitioner herein presented no evidence in the motion papers to support a claim of an absolute and unequivocal intention on the part of the decedent to make the alleged gift of onehalf of the permanent realty mortgage proceeds to him there is no indication that the decedent even knew of or actually endorsed the check in fact all the evidence in the record leads to an equally valid conclusion that the mortgage proceeds were deposited into josephs bank account as a matter of convenience for banking and payment purposes as such onehalf of the mortgage proceeds should be included as assets of the decedents estate the question remains however as to how much of these proceeds were actually in josephs bank account at the time of maries death schedule a of the accounting claims decedent had cash amounting to  at the time of her death objectant camille contends that this amount is greatly understated as it is  less than the permanent realty mortgage proceeds and asserts that such a reduction is unlikely as she the decedent owned income producing real estate petitioner responds that joseph paid sums out of his account for his wifes benefit including medical nursing and funeral expenses upon the papers presented the branch of the motion seeking summary judgment surcharging petitioner for decedents onehalf share of the mortgage proceeds  is therefore denied as the evidence submitted herein present a triable issue of fact as to the amount to be surcharged lastly camille seeks summary judgment with respect to objections     and  wherein she seeks a surcharge due to the manner in which the estate assets were invested joseph as executor of decedents estate invested the estates assets in checking accounts and certificates of deposit objectant camille contends that such deposits were made without regard for the interests of the trust remaindermen as there was no capital appreciation the principal balance is approximately the same today as it was on the date of the decedents death the accounting reveals that  was generated in income with the sum of  in interest from the checking accounts and certificates of deposit objectant camille moves for summary judgment on the issue of josephs liability and requests a hearing to determine damages the prudent investor act eptl § specifies the duties of fiduciaries when making investment decisions with as is applicable here estate and trust proceeds likewise the uniform principal and income acts eptl § et seq and §a et seq further codify the obligations of a trust fiduciary as concerns balancing investments for the benefit of income and remainder beneficiaries generally the prudent investor act sets four primary requirements for a fiduciary to follow  to pursue an overall investment strategy which balances risk and rate of return which will enable the trustee to make appropriate present and future distributions  to consider numerous factors in developing an investment strategy including size of the portfolio general economic conditions liquidity of the estate and distribution requirements and the needs of the beneficiaries  to diversify the trust assets unless the trustee reasonable determines that it is in the interests of the beneficiaries not to diversify and  to determine within a reasonable amount of time whether to retain or dispose of the assets see eptl §ba  d the prudent investor act encourages investing for total return on a portfolio    unless the governing instrument expressly provides otherwise matter of heller  nyd   morever a fiduciary is required to consider the testators primary objectives and undertake a formal analysis of the estate to establish an investment plan consistent therewith see in re estate of saxton  add   as an overall matter investment strategies should not be viewed in hindsight and the issue of whether a fiduciary has acted prudently is a factual determination to be made by the trial court in re estate of janes  nyd   in the present case the decedents last will and testament provides for two trusts a marital trust and a family trust joseph had renounced his interest in the marital trust so the residuary assets from the estate pass to the family trust which provides that the cotrustees at their discretion were to pay or provide for joseph and the decedents children income andor principal for their health education maintenance and support the trustees are also given the discretion to accumulate to the principal the article a of the trust stataes the following without infringing upon the absolute discretion of the cotrustees herein it is my intention that the wellbeing of my husband joseph s parisi is my first consideration it is therefore my desire that my cotrustees pay to my said husband or apply to his use from the family trust so much of the income either current or accumulated up to the whole thereof and as much of the principal as the cotrustees may deem necessary or desirable taking into consideration the other property or resources of my husband joseph s parisi so as to enable him to maintain the standard of living he shall have maintained prior to my death provided however that if i the sole discretion of my cotrustees my husband shall not need all the income of the family trust then the cotrustees shall distribute from the income of the family trust such part thereof as in the cotrustees sole discretion my husband may not need to my children as the cotrustees in their sole discretion shall see fit for their health education maintenance and support emphasis added in view of the fact that the family trust expresses an explicit intention to first provide for the wellbeing of the decedents husband joseph and gives the cotrustees such absolute discretion with regard to distributions of income and principal for the benefit of joseph camille has failed to establish prima facie that josephs investment of estate assets into bank accounts and certificates of deposit were as a matter of law a violation of eptl § § or eptl §aaccordingly the branch of objectant camilles motion for summary judgment finding joseph liable pursuant to eptl § § or §a is denied a pretrial conference in this proceeding shall be held on january   at  am this is the decision and order of the court dated

waiting yes sh  you were still just a rifleman jp  yes thats all i was and we stayed there for a couple weeks i guess april may  most of may sh  did you go off of the base at all  jp  no there was a little town there we used to go in  where we used to buy everything and the people didnt like us that much because we had the money and wed go in and buy out the whole damn store and it wasnt that nice  sh  were there any directions given to the us soldier on how to behave jp  oh yes  well you know you were told what the age of consent was and things like that but it was nice though  laughter sh  did you go to the pub jp  yes  there was a pub there but i wasnt really you know into drinking  i was an athlete in high school i didnt drink  or smoke  i didnt even smoke at that time  sh  were you interacting at all with the brits in any way on the base jp  no we were all americans   sh  you had barracks for yourself jp  well we lived in tents fiveman tents  sh  did you get into london at all jp  no the only part i saw of london was when we were on our way from liverpool to our camp and  we went underground to london   at that time they were bombing london and we were stopped in the station inlondon now and there were people there giving us doughnuts and stuff coffee because we couldnt go  until the bombing stopped  then we got to our base yes where we were going to be sh  your training was all right there jp  yes  well actually what it was is just a stopoff waiting to go across you know and i remember nights you know when youd see planes pulling gliders you know  then theyd circle and then theyd come back with the gliders and on dday night i was on guard duty and i was looking up and the planes went you know and then they came back with no gliders  sh  this was the night before the invasion jp  yes  well yes thats why well they had gone over and let the gliders go because they were coming back without the gliders  i said wow somethings going on and in the morning they told us you know get ready and that we you know had invaded and they moved us down into southampton and then all we did was wait there until the spots opened  we were replacement soldiers and we had to replace the guys that were killed or wounded or whatever and that was scary you know  sh  what were you hearing of how the invasion was going  was there any information jp  well at that time there wasnt too much you know  they werent really sure what was going on but while we were at the port there and around the area we could see some of the wounded coming back you know our guys  so we were on the ship waiting to go across  we were on there for a couple days  it was terrible  the english ships arent really that clean and i ate lamb cold laughter and there was really no hot water to clean your mess kits with you know  it was terrible  sh  do you remember the name of the ship you were on jp  no  sh  however it was a british ship jp  a british ship and then we transferred on lets see let me get this right now  we stayed on that until we got to the beach you know outside the beach   we went down the rope ladders onto the landing craft and then we went in but that was like six days or seven days something like that after the initial invasion  thank god i wasnt there that first day sh  which beach did you go in on jp  omaha  sh  you landed at omaha jp  yes landed at omaha  so i was there for a couple days sh  what did you see jp  well it was still a lot of mess around  i didnt see any dead bodies you know on the beach  they had cleaned that all up and we went inland sh  did you see vehicles or ships or anything jp  oh yes there were some ships there and then tanks some of the tanks that were knocked out you know the obstacles on the beach  did you see the longest day  well you saw those things  editors note mr parisi is referring to the iron antitank obstacles known as czech hedgehogs which appeared in the  film the longest day  they were there and i went up that hill up to the top and then we went inland and we dug in there and we stayed there for awhile until they decided where they were going to send us   sh  this was about june th or so jp  yes around that time maybe a little later and we went around and somebody had said there was a dead german down the road you know  so lets go see  thats when i saw my first dead soldier  then i saw a dead american too  he was laying there  he was shot right through the neck  i said oh my god sh  his body had not been reclaimed by graves registration jp  well no they were still going around you know  yes he was dead  so then they told us where we were going  so i went up to utah beach  they sent me to the fourth infantry division  so when i got there they assigned me to a heavy weapons company which is part of the regiment and i wasnt a rifleman anymore  i was on a  heavycaliber machinegun and i was on the machinegun squad and at that time they were just cleaning up the port of cherbourg  we took the germans out of cherbourg and they all surrendered and from there on i wasnt a rifleman anymore  sh  did you like that better jp  no  i was glad to not be in the infantry laughter  it wasnt that you know  sh  you were glad not to be a rifleman jp  yes yes  sh  in your squad what kind of training did you get on the heavy machinegun jp  well nothing  i carried the boxes of ammunition  they had like a leather thing  you put a couple boxes in the leather  canvas carrier and you went around and followed the gunner and the assistant gunner  sh  do you remember their names jp  yes ones sergeant parker  he was my sergeant  oh there were a couple other guys   as a matteroffact the first night that i was with them  he took me under his wing sotospeak sh  who was this jp  my sergeant sh  parker jp  parker and he said were going to dig in here  so i knew how to dig a hole we practiced that   he says ill start first   you stand guard and ill dig and then ill call you and then you can finish  well anyway he dug the whole thing  he said now get in the hole relax  he was good sh  where was he from  do you remember jp   he was a southerner somewhere i dont know alabama or somewhere nice guy   tape paused sh  you were just telling me how parker had taken you under his wing  jp  yes right sh  that was your very first night with this group jp  yes that night first night  sh  was this near cherbourg  jp  well yes the cherbourg area and that battle was finished at that time  i just had gotten there and there i saw some of the germans coming in that had surrendered  then from there we started our trek you know across france through the hedgerows then sh  can you talk a little bit about what you first remember and what you saw jp  yes   we were marching along and then wed stop and you know  we would attack and the hedgerow country was like a checkerboard  it was all little plots of land that were surrounded with big bushes and hedgerows and mounds of dirt and they separated like different farms  your farm was here and youd build a hedgerow around it and each one was separate and you had to fight for each one of these   the germans were all dug in all along there you know and it was tough a lot of casualties   sh  what do you remember of first being under attack  what were your first memories of being under fire jp  well i remember we were in an apple grove  it was a backyard you know on a farm there and we were dug in along this trench or along this hedgerow and the germans were shelling us   the shells were hitting the apple trees in the back and all you could smell is this beautiful smell of apples you know mixed in with the smell of the cordite from the exploding shells   that was my really first experience of being shelled you know eightyeights german artillery and mortars   sh  was the noise deafening  jp  its like a sizzling you know zzzzz boom you know   they had an eightyeight they called it and  it was a straight trajectory weapon  i mean you can shoot it far too but accurate you know  like a rifle   i remember there was in my foxhole this man comes this soldier comes and he was a major and he  was an observer forward artillery observer   hes there you know and standing up with his glasses and i said you know youd better watch out sir  you know  you might get hurt you know  no dont worry everythings okay  well a shell went off and he got hit in the head a little bit  well he wasnt dead but he got wounded and he fell down and im there you know this little eighteenyearold kid with this guy you know  so i said well try to well get a i call for a medic   he says you know take your first aid kit and you know put something on me  i said no ill take yours  we were trained dont use yours on somebody elses wound because you might need it  so i took his and i poured the stuff on him perhaps sulfa powder like that wrapped him up  he was scared  he was an all gung ho guy you know and they took him back sh  do you know his name jp  no   i knew he was a major  he still had his rank insignia on  you werent supposed to wear those because the germans could tell what you are cleanly shaven smelled nice sh  laughter which by then you did not  jp  yes  sh  how many people are in a machinegun squad jp  well  we had the gunner assistant gunner i dont know whether we had two ammo bearers or not  i remember maybe there were two im not sure now  then you have to go back and get more ammo if you needed it you know  sh  that was your job to go back jp   to do that yes  sh  how often would you have to do that jp  well a lot of times sh  did you go only at night jp  not often maybe once you know  see we used to fire all right the thirtycaliber watercooled its bigger its the same caliber as a light machinegun but it has a canister around it where you can put water through it and it circulates and keeps the barrel cool  because when you fire it for a long time it gets hot you know  and the bullets go crazy   you never really fired that long but we would fire it over the heads of our men so that the bullets would be hitting in front of them you know give them a little cover for the infantry guys the riflemen  sh  that is a good reason to no longer be an infantryman jp  yes definitely  laughter sh  when you would go back to get ammo how far back would you have to go jp   well not too far not too far maybe a couple roads back  sh  were you traveling alone then jp  oh yes  id crawl around like a snake sh  did you carry any weapons with you at that time jp  i had a carbine small carbine   sh  how would you communicate with other squads and with headquarters  how did you get orders that it was time to fire or to go jp  well the sergeant would know you know  theyd tell you when the attack was coming and hed get you know information from the lieutenants  i just followed along like a puppy dog  laughter sh  what were you eating c rations k rations jp  k rations  well at that time we were eating no k rations  when we landed in normandy we had d bars they were like little chocolate bars and they gave them to us when we got on the ship  to land and they gave us like i dont know six of them or eight of them something like that and you ate one bar for each meal and it was just a bar of chocolate  of course we ate  most of those on the ship you know  when we got on the beach laughter we didnt have anything left  sh  what did you do for food then jp  well we found stuff around you know  there was food  a lot of the dead guys you know they had not that i took them off the remains but they had stuff that they had accumulated you know on the beach  sh  you could just pick from that pile if you needed some jp  yes  sh  did you take any souvenirs  did you find anything jp  i had a couple yes  ive got a swastika that i got and  i had a luger   later on i took it off of a german lieutenant you know an officer  he didnt want to give it to me because  i was not an officer he was an officer he says i will only surrender my gun to a  i got my rifle  i says give me the gun  i had the rifle  i would have blew his head off  at that time i was a hardened guy you know but this is later on but not at that particular time sh  let us just proceed chronologically from there  jp  okay okay sh  we are in the hedgerows and you are making your way slowly  the first time you were under fire can you talk a little bit about that jp   then we just kept moving along and through the hedgerows it was you know just a drag going through there  it was costly you know a lot of casualties and then we got to this area called stlo and it was a town where a lot of roads came through and we wanted to break out  by that time patton had arrived with his third army which was silent  nobody knew about this and they came over and they landed in normandy and he was going to breakthrough at stlo  so we sent i remember that day we had like eighteen hundred airplanes flew over this one little area like about a foursquaremile area and they just bombed that place to oblivion and then patton came through  so they said pattons coming and dont leave anything on the road because hes going to run it over sh  really jp  and then the tanks came and so then they told us jump on anything you can jump on and go you know because they were traveling and the germans were running  they were surrendering all over the place  sh  had any surrendered near you jp  well ive seen some of them none directly that i grabbed you know  so we traveled along and then we got to  sh  during these bombings were you ever in danger from friendlyfire jp  well yes you could hear them bombs they werent that far away from us  some of the bombs fell short and we were all out there watching you know such a spectacular sight  editors note operation cobra the breakout from normandy at stlo began on july   with a massive attack by eighth air force bombers which resulted in a high number of allied casualties through friendlyfire sh  was it jp  yes all these planes  a couple of them went down you know sh  you were in a position on a hill or something where you could see jp  yes well were laying on the ground behind the hedgerow  i could see them coming over and you could hear it  then from there was just that we were trying to travel sh  what did you jump on  they said jump on anything jp  well a jeep or you know anything sh  what did you get on jp  i got on a jeep and we traveled along with them  we got to i dont know whether it was mortain there was a big battle there  did you hear about the falaise gap  that was in normandy   editors note the battle of mortain took place between august  and august   and set the stage for the battle of the falaise pocket or gap which took place between august  and august   sh  were you part of that jp  yes we had the germans trapped there but they got through  we caught a lot of them took a lot of them and that was the battle of mortain i think  that was another french town a strongpoint that the germans had and one night they were gone  they just upped and left because  they were trying to get through that gap you know and then we were on our way to paris after they got through there   then we went into paris but we were held up outside of paris in the town of fontainebleau and we stopped there and it was a resting place  we were going to rest because  the french were going to go in and take the city  which was all right with me   then we heard okay lets get up go  were going there  were going to take paris  so we got up and got on i was on a truck and we drove down into paris came down there in the morning and were the first troops inparis the first american troops   it was great and we ended up  right in front of notre dame cathedral where the town was just jubilant  everybody was running around  i never got kissed by so many women in my life yes  laughter they were all over the place  here i am a little eighteenyearold punk you know women all over hugging you kissing you  it was really great  sh  there was no resistance jp  well there were some snipers still around  they were popping around and because charles de gaulle came down just a little bit later during the day  they were shooting at him and then that didnt last long  i remember them taking the women that used to sleep with the germans sympathizers with the germans and they were cutting their hair off  i saw all that going on too sh  did you really  jp  yes sh  when you went into paris were you still together as a unit or was it more like a liberty jp  no we were a unit  yes we stayed together you know  we knew where everybody was sh  did you march in jp  we came in on trucks  then the trucks stopped we got out and formed ranks you know  so then i went up the steps of notre dame cathedral and they opened the doors and i looked inside but i didnt do anything i didnt go in but then the next day they had mass  we stayed overnight in a park in paris and then i went to mass that next morning in notre dame cathedral  it was really nice  sh  did a lot of gis go jp  oh yes  some  people were nice  but that was short lived  we left there and  traveled on again attack you know and the big parades came later where you see them walking down the champselysees you know theyre all marching but thats all  they didnt do anything you know   we went in and hey were already fighting somewhere else and theyre coming down with you know all the fanfare and everything kind of made us mad you know  we should have been marching there sh  where did you go from paris then jp  well then we traveled around and went into belgium sh  what kind of resistance did you have between paris and belgium jp  sporadic you know some fighting  actually thats where i got wounded in belgium  i got hit with a piece of antitank ordnance you know artillery fragment hit me in the knee sh  can you talk about that  what happened exactly jp  yes  well we were in this town and an antitank grenade went off or an artillery shell i forgot what it was there was an explosion sh  a german antitank shell jp  yes and i got hit in the knee a small piece but it was bleeding and a couple of guys got killed   the medic came and he dressed it and he said well you got yourself a purple heart  i said well i wish i was going home  he said no not for that  laughter so i didnt even go back to an aid station  he just bandaged it up and you know it wasnt that bad  i said thats really nothing though  thats it youre getting it  i got a purple heart for it   sh  you just went right back to your duties jp  yes we were still there  he just bandaged it sh  what did you have to do then  with a hurt leg were you still able to be an ammo carrier jp  i was able to move around yes  well i was at that time then i changed  then i became when did i become that  i got into headquarters company  you know each company had it then they had a little headquarters with the officers and a couple of men radioman wireman stuff like that  so i became a radioman carried a radio a set radio the scr   sh  when did you switch to that before paris or after paris jp   well that was after paris after paris and im trying to think when exactly it was because the original guy got hurt and i had been friends with this guy that was injured and i knew about the radio  so the captain said you want to be the radioman  i said sure because i traveled around with him you know  i used to ride around in the jeep yes  laughter so that was pretty good  sh  did you feel like a target though with that big antenna jp  well i had just a set that one you carried on your back   sh  how did you get trained on how to operate it jp  well theres nothing to it really  you just say you know roger all that stuff and i knew what they were talking about and it was pretty good because you know the captain always found a nice safe spot when we stayed at night you know and id hang around with him yes  he was already a little shellshocked  laughter sh  was he jp  no im only saying that  laughter  sh  do you remember his name and where he was from jp  yes  his name was he relieved captain thompson  i cant think of his name  sh  do you know where he was from jp  south in the south somewhere  they were all from the south sh  all from the south jp  and ill tell you they all had that accent   sh  what did they think of your jersey accent jp  yes well yes they would say hes from the north yes  laughter sh  did you eat a little better if you were with the headquarters company  jp  yes it was okay yes  sh  what about showers and hot meals jp  well that was few and far in between you know sh  when was the first hot shower that you got jp  well wed get them once in awhile  you know theyd bring up a truck or something i forgot and then they have a little area youd take your clothes off  one minute wet one minute soap up one minute to wash off and that was it  sh  did you get clean clothes then after that jp  well  theyd bring your duffle bag up you know and you have your own underwear in there  you change and throw the old stuff in to be washed and they take the bag back  sh  it was your own gear  i did not know how they did that jp  yes  and your duffle bag traveled around with you  whenever they got caught up and they had enough time theyd bring your duffle bag up and you can go to it and get your shaving stuff out and shave you know  if we were going to be there in a quiet area for a day or so you know theyd bring it up sh  how did you dress  did you figure out different ways to keep warm jp  whatever you had that was that  you know  sometimes we didnt change underwear for sometimes a week two weeks sh  by the time you got to belgium it was wintertime right jp  oh yes and we didnt have  clothes that were that warm  because we were traveling through went through belgium and luxemburg and then we went into hurtgen forest and that was a big battle there sh  what do you remember about that jp  well it was all forest of course and it was just that we had to take that area you know and that was right outside of metz i think it was metz aachen and it was a tough battle  did you watch the last the war editors note mr parisi is referring to the ken burns documentary film the war which aired on pbs during this time  the war focused on the american experience in world war ii at home and abroad  they had it on  well there was one scene in there in the episode with the battle of hurtgen forest  there was a lot of people killed   sh  when you were in luxemburg and belgium how did the people treat you  jp  oh fine   sh  before we talk about hurtgen forest more let us talk about going into luxemburg and then belgium or did you do belgium then luxemburg jp  well thats the same area pretty much yes  they were nice  people were nice  well we were friendly you know  they were glad to see us sh  were you staying in their homes in the farms jp  sometimes you know    sh  now you were with the captain and you said he found a warmer place to sleep jp  yes well i used to hang around with him but a lot of times he didnt need me  sh  then what would you do jp  id go with my other guys  sh  the ones that you had been with in the machinegun company jp  yes right yes  we were all in one group you know wasnt spread out all over the place   sh  were you getting letters and cards from home jp  yes  sometimes we wouldnt get anything and sometimes wed get four or five you know if they caught up with you  sh  when you were in luxemburg was that your first christmas in europe jp  okay  first christmas was oh that was during the battle of the bulge and  that was in luxemburg  i was in the town it was called i think walsdorf somewhere in there and we spent christmas day there and i got a package that day   they had a bar there that they opened up  the owner opened the bar up and we went in there  we were drinking and everything  but the fighting wasnt  in that particular area at that time because we had chased the germans out of there  so we had a little party there  the guy never saw so much money because we had money all over  we had no place to spend it and were throwing it on the bar and hes grabbing it up laughter sh  what was in your package  do you remember jp  oh i  remember having pineapple doles pineapple slices in a can like that and cookies and you know stuff sh  this is from your mom jp  yes my mom and i told her one time i said gee id love to have a pepsicola and one time i got a package with a bottle of pepsicola in it   just to look at a pepsicola its like being home you know laughter i showed all the guys pepsicola sh  it actually made the trip in one piece  it had not broken or anything jp   no it wasnt broken no  it was in one piece yes  they wrapped it up in you know cotton around it and everything  that was good and then i opened the pineapple and i didnt have an opener  so i had my bayonet and i chopped it all around  i gave all the guys a little piece  it was good  sh  you did not get the proverbial fruitcake at christmas jp  no no no fruitcake  fruitcakes never go bad do they  the people trade them year after year  they go on forever  they never rot or anything  laughter sh  all that booze in there i think that brandy jp  yes i know but youd think after awhile something would grow in there maybe an alcoholic bug  laughter sh  then what was the term that was used  i know bulge is the name that is given to it later what were you calling it  what was the word jp  breakthrough that the germans had broke through at something  sh  were you involved in the push back then jp  oh yes  well we were mainly on the flank  we did see a lot of action but we were holding one of the flanks so that they couldnt get through our area to get into luxemburg city  so we were mainly in luxemburg and we kept them from getting through  thats why we got the presidential unit citation for that action but we were fortunate in not being right in where the tanks were running you over and all that the german tanks   you know we had just left hurtgen forest and we were supposed to be going to a rest area which was in luxemburg we were going to go there for a long rest recuperation because it was a quiet area and they were training our troops some of our troops there  we werent there one day and the damn germans start shelling us  it was just like being in combat all over again what rest you know and then we heard they broke through   sh  we kind of goofed up our chronology here  i guess we should talk about the hurtgen forest then  jp  yes okay sh  tell me what you remember about that and what you remember about metz jp  well hurtgen forest is a forest located out that was on the road you know that we were traveling on to get into that was in germany   actually they say that it was a battle that should have never been fought you know  we could have easily bypassed that whole area or something  of course at that time we didnt know that and it was just one hectic place that the shells used to hit the trees and all the shrapnel would fly down you know and it wasnt even safe to be in a foxhole  it was safer than walking of course but you know the shrapnel would come down this way  so wed get down dig in and then dig into the side a little bit so that if anything came down you know   sh  with you being a radioman where are you and what are you doing jp  at that time i wasnt with the radio  sh  you are not there yet  jp  no no   i was back and forth with this radio business you know  id fill in if i had to you know but i was mainly with my machinegun squad  sh  were you pinned down or were you actually moving forward jp  where in luxemburg sh  in hurtgen forest jp  in hurtgen forest  well we were trying to move forward but it was a slow process  it was a stagnant area most of the time  sh  what was the weather like jp  terrible like this the weather the day of the interview snow and rain and cold sh  were you right on the front  jp  oh youre always on the front  the germans were like over there and were here you know  there was really no line because it was all trees you know and it was hard to keep track of where your guys were but we got through that  sh  then you go into luxemburg jp  then from there we went to  sh  supposedly on this restandrecreation time jp  right sh  then there was the breakthrough jp  right went to luxemburg sh  then you went right back to the front sotospeak jp  oh yes  when we left hurtgen forest we went like i said to the rest area and then thats when they broke through and it was just more fighting sh  that was where you held them and got your presidential unit citation jp  yes for the luxemburg city thing  sh  okay  do you have any other memories of that to share or incidents that you recall jp  where in sh  any of that area jp  well not really  i remember one time and i do not know just exactly where it was i know there was snow on the ground and we were in a valley you know a little town   there was a hill and they needed a radioman to go up there on the hill and relay messages from the other side of this hill because there were tanks there our tanks and i was sent up there with a couple of riflemen as guards  so we went up there and dug in and i had my radio and i was relaying messages from that other side because they couldnt get over the mountain with the radio  they would radio to me and then i would in turn radio back to this other valley you know back and forth there and using all the codes you know our son ray wants to talk to your son ray and we need an ashcan up here meaning a tank you know  it was really exciting but it was scary though laughter but that was just for that day  sh  did you go up at night or during the day jp  no i went up in the daytime  we went up there and actually we didnt get any fire from them you know well they werent up there either you know just me and two other guys  sh  then you went back to your squad jp  then i went back down sh  no longer the radioman jp  no more   i was still a radioman but  i was off that hill  see in headquarters company you know in the company headquarters you did everything  i didnt string any wire though  some of the guys that used to go stringing wire you know from one place to another theyd run with that thing under fire you know  i stayed in the hole  i dont think i stood up straight until the war ended  laughter i was always running like this hunched over  sh  you had mentioned metz  what do you remember about metz jp  i dont remember the city itself  i can see the churches you know the skyline of it you know but i was never in metz and also cologne we were around the cologne area too and i remember seeing that cathedral you know the spire up there   sh  you were with the fourth infantry jp  fourth infantry division yes the th infantry regiment sh  moving into germany where do you remember being  you talked about cologne jp  yes and then we went  through the siegfried line sh  what was that like for you and your group jp  well  it was really no big deal  we went right through that  we went through two three times laughter yes in there  because i have a map  i dont have it to show you right now and one night i slept in one of the bunkers the german bunker there  it was safe you know and the dragon teeth concrete antitank constructions you know  so once we got into there then it was pretty much clear sailing through germany  sh  was it jp  yes it was just a matter of time   the war ended in may   well march we were in germany  the war was pretty much on the way out you know it was ending there  then we crossed the danube river sh  was that the first major river crossing jp  no  well we had crossed the rhine too and we went to the danube and went across this bridge i remember that   the germans were sending down down the stream logs   on the front of the logs were dynamite you know and they were trying with the logs to hit the supports of the bridge to blow them up  so we had sharpshooters up on the high ground and theyre shooting these logs before they could hit the supports and were supposed to cross there and theres a big sign there waltz across the danube courtesy of soandso company you know  laughter sh  waltz across the danube jp  yes yes waltz across the danube one of our you know companies what do they call those guys not cbs   sh  combat engineers jp  yes combat engineers they put the bridge up sh  it was a pontoon bridge that you were crossing jp  yes but it was a pretty strong bridge  damn germans they were sending those logs down  they were always thinking of something you know  sh  what were some of the other river crossings that you did and how did that go jp  well whatever we did cross it was without any fire sh  was it  jp  yes sh  after you crossed the danube where did you go jp  well thats where we were pretty much ended there and i ended up in the bavarian alps area sh  they sent you south then jp  yes we went south in bad tölz and from where we were we could see the alps the austrian border and stayed there for awhile  of course then the war ended in may and we were on occupation duty for awhile in the town of neustadt  its called neustadt and we occupied there for a couple weeks and then we got orders to go home  so they put us on trains to go back to where did we leave from the french port of

went on  this train that was for during world war i they were fortyandeights  it was either forty men or eight horses would go on these trains  so of course we didnt have forty men on each train but we had quite a few and i spent the trip across with the captain and they had no special treatment for them either  they stayed on the floor with us you know and it was a long ride   on the way back we had the refugees coming back to poland and russia on other trains   sometimes wed stop at the same place you know for water or whatever they had and theyd be yelling back and forth  wed say ruskie no polski theyre yelling you know  theyd run over and kiss us and some of the guys were making out and everything you know  laughter it was something  sh  you talked about now im hardened  when did that transition happen for you  when did you go from being a scared eighteenyearold to this hardened veteran jp  i was a hardened scared veteran sh  at what point jp  i was always scared sh  when did you think that you  jp  well after awhile you got to a point where you accepted what was going on and you know if it happens it happens  youre not afraid anymore because you know what a shell could do but i was always afraid  id do my job but i didnt want to die either you know  i worried more about being mangled up or blinded or something like that  id rather been killed you know  sh  when did you adopt a more fatalistic attitude like so it happens  how long had you been in combat before that happened jp  i dont get it before what happened sh  before you got that fatalistic attitude jp  that whats going to be will be not long didnt take long sh  before paris after paris jp  oh before even during the hedgerow thing  sh  did you jp  yes and you got used to the fact that this is it and you know whats going to be is going to be sh  did you lose any of your close friends jp  oh yes we lost a couple yes a couple of guys that were with me in england  sh  were you there when they died  jp  i saw one die  some of the others i only heard about you know  there was one fellow from union new jersey  he worked  at the newark evening news  at that time they had a newspaper newark evening news you remember that   he worked on that newspaper and he was quite old  i mean old we were eighteen so he was maybe twentyfive  they were old you know  laughter we had one guy who was thirty we called him grandpa  sh  really  laughter jp  yes hey gramps you know  yes he died  that was terrible  his name was arthur nadel ill never forget his name worked for the newark evening news  sh  where was he killed jp  he was killed in normandy in the hedgerows  yes he was a rifleman  he was one of the riflemen and he used to write to his wife and talk about me and i would write little things in there you know im keeping an eye on him and all that stuff   so when he got killed then i was quite upset about that but when the war ended i contacted her  i called her  to tell her who i was and she knew who i was and i told her you know that i wasnt there with him when he died but i heard about it and that was it  that was the closest that you know i came knew of   then there was another fellow in our outfit he was hurt at the same time that i got hit and he lost his one eye   he was from new york and he came to visit me after that and came with his wife  they stayed overnight at our place  i was married at the time yes  he would never accept his false eye he always wore a white patch sh  did he jp  yes  he felt more comfortable with the patch on his eye sh  did you know how the war in the pacific was progressing  were there any updates  did you read thestars and stripes jp  yes i had the stars and stripes and we knew pretty much what was going on  ill tell you the truth actually i would rather have been in europe than in the pacific  in the first place i dont like hot weather and i dont like the bugs and the walking in the swamps and all that stuff you know  sh  how was the news of roosevelts death received jp  well everybody was upset you know because we knew the war was coming to an end and we thought geez he couldnt even be here for the end of it you know because the war ended only a couple weeks after he died and we felt bad about that  sh  did you have confidence in harry truman jp  well i didnt even know about truman  i knew he was the vicepresident but id never really heard of truman you know  i knew he was the vicepresident sh  had you voted yet jp  no i was too young  i wasnt twentyone and the guys were voting and then he ran against  republican nominee new york governor thomas dewey wasnt it   the guys that were older than me they were voting and i was only nineteen and i couldnt even vote  here i am fighting and i couldnt even vote right for whos going to be my boss  but i was glad truman did what he did you know with the hbomb or the atom bomb because we were set to go invade japan sh  when you were being sent back jp  well  after we left europe i came home for a thirtyday furlough   after that furlough i was supposed to go to california fort ord california and go to the pacific but while i was on vacation while i was on furlough they dropped the bomb on hiroshima and they said geez this could end the war   i was sitting in the barbers chair on south orange avenue in newark and then i heard about the atom bomb  this guy came in he was an italian guy he says oh he says we drop a bomb  it was only this a big this big a few inches right  the thing was a monster just big  it blew everything up  he was  like so knowledgeable sh  the size of a quarter jp  oh yes hes like the town wise guy you know  that big it was little thing like that  from the sun it came from the sun il sole  sh  he had it all down  laughter jp  yes he knew he had it all figured out but anyway it was good that it happened because then instead of going to fort ord california i went to north carolina to camp butner  for mustering out  from the dire thoughts of going to japan in the space of two weeks im a free man again  laughter so they were trying to entice us to stay and they were going to give me incentives  id be a staff sergeant and this and that  i said just give me my paper  i got my paper and i came home sh  i want to go back a little bit and talk about crossing the danube  did you see the russian troops at all jp  i  only saw russian troops  when we were on occupation duty in neustadt germany because that was the main road going to nuremburg and this road came right through our town   sometimes youd see some russian officers riding through on transports but i never really you know buddybuddyed with them or anything and i saw them you know sh  what were your duties in the occupation  what did you do jp  well  we had a little switchboard there and i worked on the switchboard   i got all the information you know the lieutenant talking to the captain and the captain to the major or whatever and i used to listen in a little bit see whats going on sh  any juicy stuff  jp   no no  i was waiting to hear when we were going to go home you know  so it was good there though  sh  where were you billeted there jp  in a house in one of the houses  sh  then you would report to the mess hall for meals jp  yes we had meals and they set up a kitchen sh  we spoke earlier about souvenirs that you had  where did you collect those along the line jp  well i got one off a dead german was a swastika sh  the person was dead when you got it jp  yes yes  he had it in his pocket and i think i still have it  i think i have it here no i dont  i lent my book  the book that they gave us after the war was over from the fourth division and i lent it to david sive sh  did you jp  yes and hes reading it now sh  he has got all of our information jp  he said i never got a book like that  so he still has it and that swastika is in there  sh  when did you take the luger during the surrender of the german officer jp  oh that was near the end of the war because they were surrendering like crazy you know  theyd walk out of the woods  one person could capture a whole company you know  they just wanted to get it over with and thats when i took  that luger off him and then i also got a rifle a sniper rifle from a pile of confiscated weapons  you know when you take a town the burgomeister was the mayor you know of the town and  anybody who had any weapons had to bring them to the burgomeisters house the city hall or wherever and leave them there  so i went in there and i found this  there were a couple rifles and i went for the one that had the scope on it but i couldnt get it  somebody got it before me and i got the next one  so i sent it home in pieces and i still have it  its a mauser sh  when did you think that the german people realized that the war was coming to an end jp  oh im sure that they knew  once we were established in france and moving ahead im sure they all knew it was inevitable because hitler was a madman then  they followed him but nobody knew  oh everybody hated hitler if you talked to any of the people you know sh  how did the people treat you then jp  cold  you know theyd smile but you know theyd like to stick a knife in you you know sh  was it any different as you came through the towns  did they treat you any differently after the surrender after the war ended jp  no not too much  they were kind of aloof you know  nobody knew anything  hitler was no good  hitler crazy you know  sh  did anyone talk to you  did you run into anyone who spoke english  jp  some of them did  most of them you know spoke german of course and i didnt know german  i knew some of the words  sh  when the war ended in europe what was the celebration like for you as a soldier jp  nothing big  sh  what did you do jp  we were in a town you know nothing  we didnt do anything sh  nobody shot off a gun jp  well you know i was always afraid to walk around because maybe some nut would still be trying to shoot somebody you know  we had to be you know on the alert  no it was no real big thing sh  nobody broke out a bottle of brandy jp  no we didnt have any at that point sh  you had not liberated any jp  no we didnt have any  you know  you dont have to even record this but when we were back innormandy you know the little french houses i told you about  everybody made what they called its like a french brandy sh  calvados jp  calvados yes and we used to  one canteen wed fill with calvados and the other one with water you know  so at nighttime wed get in the foxhole and get the calvados a couple of drinks  it was terrible stuff  i got heartburn every time i drank it but it was you know it was manly laughter you know hey but it was good  sh  what were some of the most interesting things that you saw as you went across europe the homes innormandy or in belgium jp  well the houses and the farmhouses all along there are pretty much the same  theyre built to last hundreds of years and the walls are that thick you know sh  two three feet thick jp  and cellars and in the cellars they used to store their eggs and potatoes   we used to go down there and steal their stuff you know the eggs  i remember one time  we were in this house and they had the fire going and the stove and we had all these eggs in a big frying pan with butter   i must have ate like maybe seven or eight eggs sunny side up  why they were so good but we always left the people some  we didnt take everything  sh  did they act like they were glad that you were there jp  no  laughter they werent happy that we were there  they smiled   sh  as part of the occupation were the nuremburg trials getting underway while you were still in europe jp  no that was after  i was home when that went on  yes that came in later on  that was in    sh  when did they send you home jp  i was discharged in  sh  no when did they send you out of europe jp  oh i left europe in july because i was home on furlough in august when they dropped the atom bomb  so we left france in july sh  what did you come home on jp  came home on a liberty ship the ss sea bass it was called and we landed in new york and i went tocamp shanks  sh  did you jp  yes  from there we went to camp shanks where i left from and do you know that i went into the same barracks that i left

sidney goldstein myself and two jewish guys from new york we were together through the whole thing  yes that was something  sh  did you keep up the friendship jp  we did for awhile and then i lost
