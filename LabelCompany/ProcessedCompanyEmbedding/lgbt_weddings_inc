share send email mail print print lgbt weddings in  a review of cmi research one year after the landmark rulings by the united states supreme court summary community marketing  insights cmi in partnership with weddingwire inc gayweddings and the gay wedding institute conducted an lgbt wedding survey about couples’ choices preferences and concerns about weddings research participants were recruited from the databases of all partner organizations and over  people completed the survey the  lgbt market research has revealed significant differences between samesex and oppositesex couples’ purchases and attitudes towards wedding ceremonies while oppositesex couples typically get engaged and married in their early s to early s in lgbt wedding the age spread is much wider ranging from early s to early s in addition samesex couples traditionally have been together longer than oppositesex couples before their marriage the reason for this is that marriage equality wasn’t available to these couples in the past since the  supreme court ruling legalizing samesex marriage across the entire united states these numbers are likely to change in the future ceremonies  receptions couples also behave differently when it comes to lgbt wedding ceremonies and receptions they have smaller ceremonies with fewer guests than oppositesex couples and as a result they spend less on their weddings however their spend per person is actually slightly higher lgbt wedding have an average of  guests compared to  guests for oppositesex weddings samesex couples spend slightly more per guest when compared to oppositesex couples  per guest vs  per guest however this may also be a function of scale as lgbt weddings tend to be smaller and perhaps this drives up the cost per guest regardless the difference is not substantive for a wedding professional only the budget of the couple before you really matters the location of ceremonies and receptions includes a wide range of venues for both samesex and oppositesex couples however since lgbt wedding tend to be smallerthey can consider more options like restaurants and private residences while larger weddings often use hotels and function spaces use of vendors when looking for wedding vendors samesex couples prefer those who are inclusive and support samesex weddings samesex couples feel very strongly that businesses should not discriminate and they support brands that use samesex couples and marriage equality in their advertising  of lgbt couples find it important that a vendor provides services to all types of couples  of samesex couples reported using at least one type of lgbtspecific wedding resource  percent of samesex couples react very positively to advertising that includes images of samesex couples some samesex couples did report discrimination in their wedding planning process discrimination can come in the form of denial of service prejudice in ‘bridal bias’ language and heteronormative assumptions an additional concern is vendor forms and marketing materials that do not acknowledge lgbt weddings  of engaged samesex couples have experienced discrimination in the planning process  percent of samesex couples fear being rejected by a vendor based on sexual orientation support of families samesex couples are far more likely than opposite sex couples to pay for the marriage themselves with no support from parents   of couples reported paying for lgbtwedding themselves there are multiple reasons first samesex couples are on average older and may not need or want support from parents some same sexweddings are quite small with no support needed and gender roles of the bride’s family offering significant support may be confusing for many families of samesex couples as families become more comfortable with samesex marriage and the average age of samesex couple weddings lowers more family support is anticipated in the future honeymoons honeymoon destinations are quite dispersed among lgbt couples but beach destinations are preferred hawaii had the most samesex honeymoons reported at  followed by florida  and mexico  conclusion lgbt weddings are a new business opportunity for united states companies that provide products and services to weddings however many samesex couples are concerned about discrimination and truly being welcomed by vendors businesses that provide genuinely inclusiveservices are likely to attract more business from the lgbt community read the full  lgbt wedding marketing research report here share on facebook share share on twittertweet share

bands for men by simon g we have something to suit every style because you are going to be wearing this ring for the rest of your life it must be something that you love and feel comfortable wearing the first decision you need to make is if you prefer white gold yellow gold rose gold or platinum while many couples choose to match each other in metal style and color it is not a requirement that you both have similar rings some of our wedding bands for men feature twotoned options giving you the best of both worlds marriage is all about compromise so combining both of your favorite metal colors into one ring is the perfect start to finding common ground as you say ‘i do’ after you choose your precious metal preference you need to decide if you want diamonds a sleek look or a more contemporary style different geometric designs can give your ring a distinct and unique look while remaining traditional a hammered look is a very popular style and when you combine it with a textured outer rim you truly have a sensational look that is still very stylish another popular style is the puzzlepiece look where different pieces of metal are positioned to look like they fit together like jigsaw pieces the lp is a great example of this style featuring twotoned metal and diamonds on the center links you can find all of our wedding bands at select highend retailers use the locate a store

have a very distinctive look and could be the perfect way to express your love uniformity is another big advantage to these pairs sometimes try as you might it can be hard to achieve a uniform look when choosing separate bands duos are designed to incorporate both bands into one stunning piece of jewelry this uniformity is something many brides desire a pair of bands is also one of the most classic looks for the classic bride engagement ring sets are unique all on their own and instead of looking as though you are wearing two or three different items the pair looks like one incredible piece purchasing a wedding pair is also convenient you only have to make one purchase and not go on the hunt for a matching band while it is certainly a big decision we are confident that our wide range of jewels will make it a much easier process we have designs to suit many tasteful styles and fashions for your special day in addition this is truly a choice of style coupled with comfort it can take time for a person to get used to wearing a band on her finger if choosing two separate pieces one of the bands could shift and move and the other could turn making it uncomfortable to wear jewelry a pair is worn as just one item which is a lot more comfortable some pairs will even feature two separate wedding bands that hug the main band on either side this style can be more difficult to do if all three pieces were to stand on their own where to buy simon g is only available from carefully selected fine jewelers enter a location to find a retailer near you results are displayed
