in   accelerate diagnostics inc nasdaqaxdx  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»accelerate diagnostics rides high on innovative product launches in jun   about accelerate diagnostics axdx gaurao bhade biotech healthcare value longshort equitysummaryfda clearance for accelerate pheno system and accelerate pheno blood culture test kit has launched accelerate diagnostics on the path of becoming profitable commercial organization accelerate diagnostics has reported robust commercial progress in the first quarter post launch of its innovative product offerings the company also boasts of a healthy research pipeline with multiple innovations to support future growth without any additional external funding the company can sustain its cash burn rate till end of  however accelerate diagnostics may not be the right investment choice for a retail investor with short investment horizon or lower risk appetite in q  in vitro diagnostics company accelerate diagnostics nasdaqaxdx reported revenues close to  which is a phenomenal  yearoveryear growth the numbers appear even more attractive when we consider that this growth is not driven by onetime events but by major growth in operational sales and this performance is definitely representative of the companys potential as it has been the first full quarter when accelerate diagnostics was equipped with all clearances both in us and eu as well as fully functional commercial team i strongly believe that accelerate diagnostics is currently perched at the start of a steep growth trajectory hence this seems to be an excellent entry point to pick up this stock in  in this article i will explain my rationale for preferring this company in greater detail fda clearance of accelerate pheno system and accelerate pheno blood culture test kit is the major revenue driver for accelerate diagnostics on february   fda approved the marketing of accelerate pheno system and accelerate pheno blood culture test kit in usa the first test that identifies infection causing organisms in the bloodstream as well as gives guidance related to antibiotics that these organisms will respond to unlike traditional blood culture based tests and antibiotic susceptibility tests that require a day or two for giving results accelerate pheno blood culture test can identify organisms in  hours and suggest the correct course of antibiotics in next  hours out of the  assays in accelerate pheno blood culture test kit  have been approved for marketing by fda while the remaining  can be run only in research mode this approval marked the entry of the first fully automated solution to directly test patient samples for quantitative analysis of antibiotic susceptibility data from the early access program in usa has underlined the impact of this diagnostic solution in improving antibiotic prescribing practices which involves prescribing the right medicine without delay thus resulting in improved patient outcomes accelerate pheno system and accelerate pheno blood culture test kit together help detect and treat lifethreatening conditions such as bacteremia or fungemia prior to marketing approval in usa on june   accelerate diagnostics also managed to secure ce mark to market the solution for in vitro diagnostic use in europe however while the public procurement process in europe results in a delay of  to  months from the time of first customer contact to actual placement conversion on the other hand the process is much faster in usa requiring around  to  days for realizing a sale of solution hence it can be concluded that the fda approval has provided the actual traction to accelerate diagnostics in  in q  accelerate pheno system sales soared in usa while pheno consumable sales rose both in usa and europe accelerate diagnostics has made solid progress in launching accelerate pheno system and accelerate pheno blood culture test kit in q  at the end of q  accelerate diagnostics had signed contracts for  instruments globally of which  were evaluation contracts while the remaining  were placement contracts the difference in evaluation and placement contracts is that while former is a commitment to purchase the solution subject to fulfillment of certain conditions the latter is revenue generating commercial order that has progressed favorably from the evaluation phase within couple of months of launch of the in vitro diagnostic solution in north america accelerate diagnostics has managed to secure evaluation contracts for  instruments and placement contracts for  instruments this number is over and above the instruments supplied through early access programs and at clinical study sites which are demonstrating a high tendency to get converted in additional evaluation contracts since laboratories completely verify the suitability of the solution in the evaluation phase there is much higher probability of clinical adoption in case a requirement match is identified majority of the instrument sales in usa are expected to be capital sales in  on the other hand majority of instrument sales in europe are expected to be reagent rentals in europe accelerate diagnostics currently holds evaluation contracts for  instruments and placement contracts for  instruments in france the company also secured a ugap certification which allows accelerate diagnostics to bypass a very tedious and lengthy public tender process to place their instruments at hospitals the robust commercial progress made in q  raises hopes about the growth prospects for accelerate diagnostics in remaining part of  accelerate diagnostics has been striving to further improve its positive blood culture test in q  accelerate diagnostics continued developing new antibiotic susceptibility testing or ast assays and improved existing assays further one of the collaborators of the company also conducted feasibility test to ensure if accelerate pheno system can be used for detecting heterogeneous vancomycin intermediate staph aureus or hvisa from positive blood cultures the positive result from this test confirms the use of accelerate pheno system for hvisa detection a definite clinical advantage not available from any other diagnostic platform it should be noted that hvisa phenotype results higher failure rates for antibiotic vancomycin the company also expects to launch an innovative respiratory test kit by  in usa in q  accelerate diagnostics has initiated a multicenter pilot study with a mandate to identify pathogens and deliver ast results within  hours directly using respiratory samples if this becomes possible it will help improve patient outcomes as well as reduce healthcare costs currently the traditional respiratory tests take more than  hours for delivering these results accelerate diagnostics expects to secure ce mark for this solution in  and fda marketing approval in  cash burn rate assumes significant importance for loss making company like accelerate diagnostics in q  accelerate diagnostics spent around  million cash the company anticipates higher cash burn rate in subsequent quarters in  owing to higher marketing and promotional expenses i assume the annual cash burn rate of accelerate diagnostics to be close to  million in  the companys cash investments were around  million at end of q  further on may   the company announced the closing of its underwritten  million worth public offering without raising any more funding the company can sustain its business for more than  years ie upto end of  hence cash burn rate does not pose an immediate risk to the company as a going concern but accelerate diagnostics is definitely not for the weak hearted there are certain key company specific risks that make accelerate diagnostics unsuitable for retail investors with shorter time horizon or below average risk appetite currently majority of its revenues and future growth prospects depend on successful adoption of accelerate pheno system and accelerate pheno blood culture test kit this overreliance on a small set of product offerings exposes the company to high level of concentration risk it should also be remembered that analysts do not project the company to turn profitable any time close in future hence low risk investors or those who depend on dividend income may find accelerate diagnostics an unviable option the company is also competing with roche holdings otcqxrhhby in this area a tough competitor with deep pockets for research development and commercialization however if you have an above average risk appetite the

better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search why accelerate diagnostics inc is soaring today shares jump after the fda gives the green light to two of the companys products brian feroldi tmftypeoh feb   at pm what happened in response to receiving fda marketing authorization for two products shares of accelerate diagnostics nasdaqaxdx a company focused on the rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases rose by  as of  am est friday so what accelerate announced that the fda has granted the companys de novo request to allow the marketing of the accelerate pheno system and accelerate phenotest bc kit the de novo classification process calls for an expedited fda review of new devices that have a lowtomoderate risk and for which no predicate device exists image source getty images the accelerate phenotest bc kit promises to allow labs to significantly reduce the turnaround time of testing for infectious diseases thats a big deal as the sooner that healthcare providers receive a diagnosis the faster they can begin treatment this is especially important when dealing with antibiotic resistant bacteria current testing processes often require a turnaround time of  hours or more by contrast the accelerate phenotest bc kit can produce a result up to  hours faster than conventional technology lawrence mehren accelerates ceo was thrilled with the approval news we are excited to offer microbiologists and treating physicians earlier intelligence about the infections they fight on a daily basis mehren said traders reacted positively to the fdas decision hence why shares are screaming higher on friday now what according to the centers for disease control and prevention roughly two million people in the us are infected with antibioticresistant bacteria each year those infections lead to the death of approximately  patients annually which is telling about the huge unmet medical need for faster diagnostic equipment that shows there is a wide open market opportunity for the pheno system the market for diagnostic equipment is highly competitive so theres no guarantee of success here well funded companies such as bd and danaher also have an eye on this market so it is too early to tell if the systems speed will help give it an edge in the market still winning fda is always good news so it is easy to understand why traders are feeling bullish on friday  brian feroldi has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool has a disclosure policy
