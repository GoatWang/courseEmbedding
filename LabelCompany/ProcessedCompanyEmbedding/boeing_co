river which later became his first airplane factory boeing was incorporated in seattle by william boeing on july   as pacific aero products co boeing was later incorporated in delaware the original certificate of incorporation was filed with the secretary of state of delaware on july   boeing who studied at yale university worked initially in the timber industry where he became wealthy and learned about wooden structures this knowledge proved invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of airplanes the company stayed in seattle to take advantage of the local supply of spruce wood william boeing founded his company a few months after the june  maiden flight of one of the two bw seaplanes built with the assistance of george conrad westervelt a us navy engineer boeing and westervelt decided to build the bw seaplane after having flown in a curtiss aircraft boeing bought a glenn martin flying birdcage seaplane so called because of all the guywires holding it together and was taught to fly by glenn martin himself boeing soon crashed the birdcage and when martin informed boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time he and his friend cdr gc westervelt agreed to build a better airplane and soon produced the bw seaplane this first boeing airplane was assembled in a lakeside hangar located on the northeast shore of seattles lake union many of boeings early planes were seaplanes on april   the us declared war on germany and later in the year entered world war i on may   the company became the boeing airplane company with the us entering the war boeing knew that the us navy needed seaplanes for training so boeing shipped two new model cs to pensacola florida where the planes were flown for the navy the navy liked the model c and ordered  more the company moved its operations to a larger former shipbuilding facility known as boeing plant  located on the lower duwamish river washington state boeings original logo when world war i ended in  a large surplus of cheap used military planes flooded the commercial airplane market preventing aircraft companies from selling any new airplanes driving many out of business others including boeing started selling other products boeing built dressers counters and furniture along with flatbottom boats called sea sleds in  the boeing b flying boat made its first flight it accommodated one pilot and two passengers and some mail over the course of eight years it made international airmail flights from seattle to victoria british columbia on may   the boeing model  made its first flight it was the first plane to fly over mount rainier in  boeing entered competition against curtiss to develop a pursuit fighter for the us army air service although curtiss finished its design first and was awarded the contract boeing continued to develop its pw fighter that plane along with the boeing p fb fighter made boeing a leading manufacturer of fighters over the course of the next decade in  boeing built its model  mail plane for the us government to use on airmail routes in  an improved version of this plane was built the model a which won the us post offices contract to deliver mail between san francisco and chicago the a also had a passenger cabin that accommodated two that same year boeing created an airline named boeing air transport which merged a year later with pacific air transport and the boeing airplane company the first airmail flight for the airline was on july   the company changed its name to united aircraft and transport corporation in  and acquired pratt  whitney hamilton standard propeller company and chance vought united aircraft then purchased national air transport in  on july   the passenger boeing  biplane made its first flight with three engines it was boeings first plane built with the sole intention of being a passenger transport an upgraded version the a carrying eighteen passengers made its first flight in september  s and sedit in  the monomail a lowwing monoplane that carried mail was built built entirely out of metal it was very fast and aerodynamic and had retractable landing gear in fact its design was so revolutionary that the engines and propellers of the time could not handle the plane by the time controllable pitch propellers were developed boeing was building its model  airliner two monomails were built the second one the model  had a passenger cabin in  the boeing  was introduced the first truly modern airliner the  was an allmetal lowwing monoplane that was much faster safer and easier to fly than other passenger aircraft for example it was the first twin engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine in an era of unreliable engines this vastly improved flight safety boeing built the first sixty aircraft exclusively for its own united airlines subsidiarys operations this badly hurt competing airlines and was typical of the anticompetitive corporate behavior that the us government sought to prohibit at the time the air mail act of  prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella so the company split into three smaller companies – boeing airplane company united airlines and united aircraft corporation the precursor to united technologies as a result william boeing sold off his shares and left boeing clairmont claire l egtvedt who had become boeings president in  became the chairman as well he believed the companys future was in building bigger planes work began in  on boeing plant  to accommodate the production of larger modern aircraft boeing b assembly line in wichita kansas  boeing  stratocruiser shortly after an agreement with pan american world airways pan am was reached to develop and build a commercial flying boat able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes the first flight of the boeing  clipper was in june  it was the largest civil aircraft of its time with a capacity of  passengers on day flights and of  passengers on night flights one year later the first regular passenger service from the us to the uk was inaugurated subsequently other routes were opened so that soon pan am flew with the boeing  to destinations all over the world in  boeing completed work on its model  stratoliner this was the worlds first pressurizedcabin transport aircraft and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of  feet  m – above most weather disturbances it was based on the b using the same wings tail and engines during world war ii boeing built a large number of b and b bombers boeing ranked twelfth among united states corporations in the value of wartime production contracts many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war in the beginning of march  production had been scaled up in such a manner that over  planes were built each month to prevent an attack from the air the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items during these years of war the leading aircraft companies of the us cooperated the boeingdesigned b bomber was assembled also by lockheed aircraft corp and douglas aircraft co while the b was assembled also by bell aircraft co and by glenn l martin company after the war most orders of bombers were canceled and  people lost their jobs at boeingcitation needed the company aimed to recover quickly by selling its stratocruiser the model  a luxurious fourengine commercial airliner developed from the b however sales of this model were not as expected and boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situationcitation needed the company successfully sold military derivatives of the stratocruiser such as the c adapted for troop transportation and the kc for aerial refuelingcitation needed sedit the boeing  in british overseas airways corporation boac livery  boeing developed military jets such as the b stratojet and b stratofortress bombers in the lates and into the s during the early s boeing used company funds to develop the – jet airliner demonstrator that led to the kc stratotanker and boeing  jetliner some of these were built at boeings facilities in wichita kansas which existed from  to  in the mids technology had advanced significantly which gave boeing the opportunity to develop and manufacture new products one of the first was the guided shortrange missile used to intercept enemy aircraft by that time the cold war had become a fact of life and boeing used its shortrange missile technology to develop and build an intercontinental missile in  boeing began delivery of its  the united states first commercial jet airliner in response to the british de havilland comet french sud aviation caravelle and soviet tupolev tu which were the worlds first generation of commercial jet aircraft with the  a fourengine passenger airliner the us became a leader in commercial jet manufacture a few years later boeing added a second version of this aircraft the boeing  which was slightly faster and had a shorter range boeing was a major producer of small turbine engines during the s and s the engines represented one of the companys major efforts to expand its product base beyond military aircraft after world war ii development on the gasoline turbine engine started in  and boeings gas turbines were designated models     and  boeing built  engines before production ceased in april  many applications of the boeing gas turbine engines were considered to be firsts including the first turbinepowered helicopter and boat sedit the  and  formed the backbone of many major airline fleets through the end of the s including united  shown and pan am  shown lufthansa boeing  a boeing  the bestselling aircraft vertol aircraft corporation was acquired by boeing in  and was reorganized as boeings vertol division the twinrotor ch chinook produced by vertol took its first flight in  this heavylift helicopter remains a workhorse vehicle up to the present day in  vertol also began production of the ch sea knight in december  boeing announced the model  jetliner which went into commercial service about three years later different passenger freight and convertible freighter variants were developed for the  the  was the first commercial jetliner to reach  sales boeing won a contract in  to manufacture the sic stage of the saturn v rocket manufactured at the michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana in  boeing president william m allen asked malcolm t stamper to spearhead production of the new  airliner on which the companys future was riding this was a monumental engineering and management challenge and included construction of the worlds biggest factory in which to build the  at everett washington a plant which is the size of  football fields in  boeing introduced another short and mediumrange airliner the twinengine  it has become since then the bestselling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history several versions have been developed mainly to increase seating capacity and range the  remains in production as of april  the rollout ceremonies for the first  took place in  at the massive new factory in everett about an hours drive from boeings seattle home the aircraft made its first flight a year later the first commercial flight occurred in  the  has an intercontinental range and a larger seating capacity than boeings previous aircraft boeing also developed hydrofoils in the s the screwdriven uss high point pch was an experimental submarine hunter the patrol hydrofoil uss tucumcari pgh was more successful only one was built but it saw service in vietnam and europe before running aground in  its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the example for the later pegasusclass patrol hydrofoils and the model  jetfoil ferries in the s the tucumcari and later boats were produced in renton while the navy hydrofoils were withdrawn from service in the late s the boeing jetfoils are still in service in asia sedit in the early s boeing suffered from the simultaneous decline in vietnam war military spending the slowing of the space program as project apollo neared completion the recession of – and the companys  billion debt as it built the new  airliner boeing did not receive any orders for more than a year its bet for the future the  was delayed in production by three months because of problems with its pratt  whitney engines another problem was that in  the us congress decided to stop funding for the development of the supersonic  boeings answer to the britishfrench concorde forcing the company to discontinue the project commercial airplane group by far the largest unit of boeing went from  employees in  to  in  each unemployed boeing

dealerships ran out of trailers because so many people moved out a billboard appeared near the airport– will the last person leaving seattle  turn out the lights in january  the first  a fourengine longrange airliner flew its first commercial flight with pan american world airways the  changed the airline industry providing much larger seating capacity than any other airliner in production the company has delivered over  boeing s the  has undergone continuous improvements to keep it technologically uptodate larger versions have also been developed by stretching the upper deck the newest version of the  the  is in production as of  boeing launched three jetfoil  hydrofoils that were acquired in  for service in the hawaiian islands when the service ended in  the three hydrofoils were acquired by far east hydrofoil for service between hong kong and macau during the s boeing also developed the us standard light rail vehicle which has been used in san francisco boston and morgantown west virginia sedit the narrow body boeing  replaced the  this example is in turkmenistan airlines livery the boeing  replaced the boeing  this example is in qantas livery in  the economic situation began to improve boeing assembled its th  passenger aircraft during the following years commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces as passenger air traffic increased competition was harder mainly from airbus a european newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing boeing had to offer new aircraft and developed the singleaisle  the larger twinaisle  and upgraded versions of the  an important project of these years was the space shuttle to which boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the apollo era boeing participated also with other products in the space program and was the first contractor for the international space station program during the decade several military projects went into production including boeing support of the stealth b bomber as part of an industry team led by northrop boeing built the outboard portion of the b stealth bomber wing the aft center fuselage section landing gear fuel system and weapons delivery system at its peak in  the b was the largest military program at boeing employing about  people the same year the national aeronautic association of the usa awarded the b design team the collier trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in america the first b rolled out of the bombers final assembly facility in palmdale california in november  and it flew for the first time on july   the avenger air defense system and a new generation of shortrange missiles also went into production during these years boeing was very active in upgrading existing military equipment and developing new ones boeing also contributed to wind power development with the experimental mod wind turbines for nasa and the united states department of energy and the modb for hawaii sedit air france er boeing was one of seven competing companies that bid for the advanced tactical fighter boeing agreed to team with general dynamics and lockheed so that all three companies would participate in the development if one of the three companies designs was selected the lockheed design was eventually selected and developed into the f raptor in april  boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time the twinengine  with a seating capacity of approximately  to  passengers in a typical threeclass layout in between the  and the  the longest range twinengined aircraft in the world the  was the first boeing airliner to feature a flybywire system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the european airbus into boeings traditional market this aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using computeraided design cad techniques the  was also the first airplane to be certified for  minute etops at entry into service by the faa also in the mids the company developed the revamped version of the  known as the  nextgeneration or ng it has since become the fastestselling version of the  in history and on april   sales passed those of the classic  with a followup order for  aircraft from southwest airlines in  boeing chose to demolish the headquarters complex on east marginal way south instead of upgrading it to match new seismic standards the headquarters were moved to an adjacent building and the facility was demolished in  in  boeing was headquartered on east marginal way south by king county airport in seattle in  boeing acquired rockwells aerospace and defense units the rockwell business units became a subsidiary of boeing named boeing north american inc in august  boeing merged with mcdonnell douglas in a us billion stock swap under the name the boeing company however this name had actually been boeings official name previously adopted on may   following the merger the mcdonnell douglas md was renamed the boeing  and the production of the md was limited to the freighter version boeing introduced a new corporate identity with completion of the merger incorporating the boeing logo type and a stylized version of the mcdonnell douglas symbol which was derived from the douglas aircraft logo from the s aerospace analyst scott hamilton heavily criticized the ceo and his deputy philip m condit and harry stonecipher for thinking of their personal benefit first and with it causing the problems hitting boeing many years later instead of investing the huge cash reserve to build new airplanes they initiated a program to buy back boeing stock for more than us billionimportance –edit international space

communications company which had pioneered the satellite communications field in september  boeing moved its corporate headquarters from seattle to chicago chicago dallas and denver – vying to become the new home of the worlds largest aerospace concern – all had offered packages of multimilliondollar tax breaks its offices are located in the fulton river district just outside the loop chicago on october   boeing lost to its rival lockheed martin in the fierce competition for the multibilliondollar joint strike fighter contract boeings entry the x was rejected in favor of lockheeds x entrant boeing continues to serve as the prime contractor on the international space station and has built several of the major components boeing began development of the kc aerial refueling tanker in the early s italy and japan ordered four kcs each after development delays and faa certification boeing delivered the tankers to japan from  with the second kc following on march  to  italy received its four kc during  in  boeing ended production of the  after  aircraft were produced more advanced stretched versions of the  were beginning to compete against the  and the planned  was to fill much of the top end of the  market also that year boeing announced that the  the last civil aircraft to be designed by mcdonnell douglas would cease production in  the  was in danger of cancellation as well with the  replacing it but orders for the freighter version extended the program after several decades of success boeing lost ground to airbus and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in  multiple boeing projects were pursued and then canceled notably the sonic cruiser a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the speed of sound cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as  percent it was launched in  along with a new advertising campaign to promote the companys new motto forever new frontiers and to rehabilitate its image however the planes fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the september  attacks and the subsequent weak economy and increase in fuel prices subsequently boeing streamlined its production and turned its attention to a new model the boeing  dreamliner using much of the technology developed for the sonic cruiser but in a more conventional aircraft designed for maximum efficiency the company also launched new variants of its successful  and  models the  proved to be a highly popular choice with airlines and won a record number of prelaunch orders with delays to airbus a program several airlines threatened to switch their a orders to boeings new  version the  airbuss response to the  the a received a lukewarm response at first when it was announced as an improved version of the a and then gained significant orders when airbus promised an entirely new design the  program has encountered delays with the first flight not occurring until late  after regulatory approval boeing formed a joint venture united launch alliance with its competitor lockheed martin on december   the new venture is the largest provider of rocket launch services to the us government on august   boeing sold its rocketdyne rocket engine division to pratt  whitney on may   boeing agreed to purchase dallas texasbased aviall inc for  billion and retain  million in debt aviall inc and its subsidiaries aviall services inc and ils formed a wholly owned subsidiary of boeing commercial aviation services bcas realizing that increasing numbers of passengers have become reliant on their computers to stay in touch boeing introduced connexion by boeing a satellite based internet connectivity service that promised air travelers unprecedented access to the world wide web the company debuted the product to journalists in  receiving generally favorable reviews however facing competition from cheaper options such as cellular networks it proved too difficult to sell to most airlines in august  after a short and unsuccessful search for a buyer for the business boeing chose to discontinue the service on august   nasa selected boeing as the manufacturing contractor for the liquidfueled upper stage of

pentagon announced the project was to be frozen while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers darleen druyun who began employment at boeing in january was begun the fallout of this resulted in the resignation of boeing ceo philip m condit and the termination of cfo michael m sears harry stonecipher former mcdonnell douglas ceo and boeing coo replaced condit on an interim basis druyun pleaded guilty to inflating the price of the contract to favor her future employer and to passing information on the competing airbus a mrtt bid in october  she received a jail sentence for corruption in march  the boeing board forced president and ceo harry stonecipher to resign boeing said an internal investigation revealed a consensual relationship between stonecipher and a female executive that was inconsistent with boeings code of conduct and would impair his ability to lead the company james a bell served as interim ceo in addition to his normal duties as boeings cfo until the appointment of jim mcnerney as the new chairman president and ceo on june   industrial espionageedit in june  lockheed martin sued boeing alleging that the company had resorted to industrial espionage in  to win the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv competition lockheed martin claimed that the former employee kenneth branch who went to work for mcdonnell douglas and boeing passed nearly  pages of proprietary documents to his new employers lockheed martin argued that these documents allowed boeing to win  of the  tendered military satellite launches in july  boeing was penalized with the pentagon stripping seven launches away from the company and awarding them to lockheed martin furthermore the company was forbidden to bid for rocket contracts for a twentymonth period which expired in march  in early september  it was reported that boeing was negotiating a settlement with the us department of justice in which it would pay up to  million to cover this and the darleen druyun scandal  euus agreement notesedit until the late s the us had a near monopoly in the large civil aircraft lca sector the airbus consortium created in  started competing effectively in the s at that stage the us became concerned about the european competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the european governments for the developments of the early models of the airbus family this became a major issue of contention as the european side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to us lca manufacturers through nasa and defense programs the eu and the us started bilateral negotiations for the limitation of government subsidies to the lca sector in the late s negotiations were concluded in  with the signing of the ecus agreement on trade in large civil aircraft which imposes disciplines on government support on both sides of the atlantic which are significantly stricter than the relevant world trade organization wto rules notably the agreement regulates in detail the forms and limits of government support prescribes transparency obligations and commits the parties to avoiding trade disputes subsidy disputesedit in  the eu and the us agreed to discuss a possible revision of the  euus agreement provided that this would cover all forms of subsidies including those used in the us and in particular the subsidies for the boeing  the first new aircraft to be launched by boeing for  years in october  the us began legal proceedings at the wto by requesting wto consultations on european launch investment to airbus the us also unilaterally withdrew from the  euus agreement the us claimed airbus had violated a  bilateral accord when it received what boeing deemed unfair subsidies from several european governments airbus responded by filing a separate complaint contesting that boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the us government moreover the eu also complained that the investment subsidies from japanese airlines violated the accord on january   boeing and airbus agreed that they would attempt to find a solution to the dispute outside of the wto however in june  boeing and the united states government reopened the trade dispute with the wto claiming that airbus had received illegal subsidies from european governments airbus has also responded to this claim against boeing reopening the dispute and also accusing boeing of receiving subsidies from the us government on september   the wto ruled that boeing had received billions of dollars in government subsidies boeing responded by stating that the ruling was a fraction of the size of the ruling against airbus and that it required few changes in its operations boeing has received  billion in support from washington state future conceptsedit in may  four concept designs being examined by boeing were outlined in the seattle times based on corporate internal documents the research aims in two directions lowcost airplanes and environmentalfriendly planes codenamed after the wellknown muppets a design team known as the green team concentrated primarily on reducing fuel usage all four designs illustrated rearengine layouts fozzie employs open rotors and offers a lower cruising speed beaker has very thin long wings with the ability to partially foldup to facilitate easier taxiing kermit kruiser has forward swept wings over which are positioned its engines with the aim of lowering noise below due to the reflection of the exhaust signature upward honeydew with its delta wing design resembles a marriage of the flying wing concept and the traditional tube fuselage as with most concepts these designs are only in the exploratory stage intended to help boeing evaluate the potentials of such radical technologies boeing recently patented its own force field technology also known as the shock wave attenuation system that would protect vehicles from shock waves generated by nearby explosions

the boeing model  at the museum of flight william e boeing in  in march  william e boeing bought heaths shipyard in seattle on the duwamish river which later became his first airplane factory boeing was incorporated in seattle by william boeing on july   as pacific aero products co boeing was later incorporated in delaware the original certificate of incorporation was filed with the secretary of state of delaware on july   boeing who studied at yale university worked initially in the timber industry where he became wealthy and learned about wooden structures this knowledge proved invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of airplanes the company stayed in seattle to take advantage of the local supply of spruce wood william boeing founded his company a few months after the june  maiden flight of one of the two bw seaplanes built with the assistance of george conrad westervelt a us navy engineer boeing and westervelt decided to build the bw seaplane after having flown in a curtiss aircraft boeing bought a glenn martin flying birdcage seaplane so called because of all the guywires holding it together and was taught to fly by glenn martin himself boeing soon crashed the birdcage and when martin informed boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time he and his friend cdr gc westervelt agreed to build a better airplane and soon produced the bw seaplane this first boeing airplane was assembled in a lakeside hangar located on the northeast shore of seattles lake union many of boeings early planes were seaplanes on april   the us declared war on germany and later in the year entered world war i on may   the company became the boeing airplane company with the us entering the war boeing knew that the us navy needed seaplanes for training so boeing shipped two new model cs to pensacola florida where the planes were flown for the navy the navy liked the model c and ordered  more the company moved its operations to a larger former shipbuilding facility known as boeing plant  located on the lower duwamish river washington state boeings original logo when world war i ended in  a large surplus of cheap used military planes flooded the commercial airplane market preventing aircraft companies from selling any new airplanes driving many out of business others including boeing started selling other products boeing built dressers counters and furniture along with flatbottom boats called sea sleds in  the boeing b flying boat made its first flight it accommodated one pilot and two passengers and some mail over the course of eight years it made international airmail flights from seattle to victoria british columbia on may   the boeing model  made its first flight it was the first plane to fly over mount rainier in  boeing entered competition against curtiss to develop a pursuit fighter for the us army air service although curtiss finished its design first and was awarded the contract boeing continued to develop its pw fighter that plane along with the boeing p fb fighter made boeing a leading manufacturer of fighters over the course of the next decade in  boeing built its model  mail plane for the us government to use on airmail routes in  an improved version of this plane was built the model a which won the us post offices contract to deliver mail between san francisco and chicago the a also had a passenger cabin that accommodated two that same year boeing created an airline named boeing air transport which merged a year later with pacific air transport and the boeing airplane company the first airmail flight for the airline was on july   the company changed its name to united aircraft and transport corporation in  and acquired pratt  whitney hamilton standard propeller company and chance vought united aircraft then purchased national air transport in  on july   the passenger boeing  biplane made its first flight with three engines it was boeings first plane built with the sole intention of being a passenger transport an upgraded version the a carrying eighteen passengers made its first flight in september  s and sedit in  the monomail a lowwing monoplane that carried mail was built built entirely out of metal it was very fast and aerodynamic and had retractable landing gear in fact its design was so revolutionary that the engines and propellers of the time could not handle the plane by the time controllable pitch propellers were developed boeing was building its model  airliner two monomails were built the second one the model  had a passenger cabin in  the boeing  was introduced the first truly modern airliner the  was an allmetal lowwing monoplane that was much faster safer and easier to fly than other passenger aircraft for example it was the first twin engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine in an era of unreliable engines this vastly improved flight safety boeing built the first sixty aircraft exclusively for its own united airlines subsidiarys operations this badly hurt competing airlines and was typical of the anticompetitive corporate behavior that the us government sought to prohibit at the time the air mail act of  prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella so the company split into three smaller companies – boeing airplane company united airlines and united aircraft corporation the precursor to united technologies as a result william boeing sold off his shares and left boeing clairmont claire l egtvedt who had become boeings president in  became the chairman as well he believed the companys future was in building bigger planes work began in  on boeing plant  to accommodate the production of larger modern aircraft boeing b assembly line in wichita kansas  boeing  stratocruiser shortly after an agreement with pan american world airways pan am was reached to develop and build a commercial flying boat able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes the first flight of the boeing  clipper was in june  it was the largest civil aircraft of its time with a capacity of  passengers on day flights and of  passengers on night flights one year later the first regular passenger service from the us to the uk was inaugurated subsequently other routes were opened so that soon pan am flew with the boeing  to destinations all over the world in  boeing completed work on its model  stratoliner this was the worlds first pressurizedcabin transport aircraft and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of  feet  m – above most weather disturbances it was based on the b using the same wings tail and engines during world war ii boeing built a large number of b and b bombers boeing ranked twelfth among united states corporations in the value of wartime production contracts many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war in the beginning of march  production had been scaled up in such a manner that over  planes were built each month to prevent an attack from the air the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items during these years of war the leading aircraft companies of the us cooperated the boeingdesigned b bomber was assembled also by lockheed aircraft corp and douglas aircraft co while the b was assembled also by bell aircraft co and by glenn l martin company after the war most orders of bombers were canceled and  people lost their jobs at boeingcitation needed the company aimed to recover quickly by selling its stratocruiser the model  a luxurious fourengine commercial airliner developed from the b however sales of this model were not as expected and boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situationcitation needed the company successfully sold military derivatives of the stratocruiser such as the c adapted for troop transportation and the kc for aerial refuelingcitation needed sedit the boeing  in british overseas airways corporation boac livery  boeing developed military jets such as the b stratojet and b stratofortress bombers in the lates and into the s during the early s boeing used company funds to develop the – jet airliner demonstrator that led to the kc stratotanker and boeing  jetliner some of these were built at boeings facilities in wichita kansas which existed from  to  in the mids technology had advanced significantly which gave boeing the opportunity to develop and manufacture new products one of the first was the guided shortrange missile used to intercept enemy aircraft by that time the cold war had become a fact of life and boeing used its shortrange missile technology to develop and build an intercontinental missile in  boeing began delivery of its  the united states first commercial jet airliner in response to the british de havilland comet french sud aviation caravelle and soviet tupolev tu which were the worlds first generation of commercial jet aircraft with the  a fourengine passenger airliner the us became a leader in commercial jet manufacture a few years later boeing added a second version of this aircraft the boeing  which was slightly faster and had a shorter range boeing was a major producer of small turbine engines during the s and s the engines represented one of the companys major efforts to expand its product base beyond military aircraft after world war ii development on the gasoline turbine engine started in  and boeings gas turbines were designated models     and  boeing built  engines before production ceased in april  many applications of the boeing gas turbine engines were considered to be firsts including the first turbinepowered helicopter and boat sedit the  and  formed the backbone of many major airline fleets through the end of the s including united  shown and pan am  shown lufthansa boeing  a boeing  the bestselling aircraft vertol aircraft corporation was acquired by boeing in  and was reorganized as boeings vertol division the twinrotor ch chinook produced by vertol took its first flight in  this heavylift helicopter remains a workhorse vehicle up to the present day in  vertol also began production of the ch sea knight in december  boeing announced the model  jetliner which went into commercial service about three years later different passenger freight and convertible freighter variants were developed for the  the  was the first commercial jetliner to reach  sales boeing won a contract in  to manufacture the sic stage of the saturn v rocket manufactured at the michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana in  boeing president william m allen asked malcolm t stamper to spearhead production of the new  airliner on which the companys future was riding this was a monumental engineering and management challenge and included construction of the worlds biggest factory in which to build the  at everett washington a plant which is the size of  football fields in  boeing introduced another short and mediumrange airliner the twinengine  it has become since then the bestselling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history several versions have been developed mainly to increase seating capacity and range the  remains in production as of april  the rollout ceremonies for the first  took place in  at the massive new factory in everett about an hours drive

passenger aircraft during the following years commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces as passenger air traffic increased competition was harder mainly from airbus a european newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing boeing had to offer new aircraft and developed the singleaisle  the larger twinaisle  and upgraded versions of the  an important project of these years was the space shuttle to which boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the apollo era boeing participated also with other products in the space program and was the first contractor for the international space station program during the decade several military projects went into production including boeing support of the stealth b bomber as part of an industry team led by northrop boeing built the outboard portion of the b stealth bomber wing the aft center fuselage section landing gear fuel system and weapons delivery system at its peak in  the b was the largest military program at boeing employing about  people the same year the national aeronautic association of the usa awarded the b design team the collier trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in america the first b rolled out of the bombers final assembly facility in palmdale california in november  and it flew for the first time on july   the avenger air defense system and a new generation of shortrange missiles also went into production during these years boeing was very active in upgrading existing military equipment and developing new ones boeing also contributed to wind power development with the experimental mod wind turbines for nasa and the united states department of energy and the modb for hawaii sedit air france er boeing was one of seven competing companies that bid for the advanced tactical fighter boeing agreed to team with general dynamics and lockheed so that all three companies would participate in the development if one of the three companies designs was selected the lockheed design was eventually selected and developed into the f raptor in april  boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time the twinengine  with a seating capacity of approximately  to  passengers in a typical threeclass layout in between the  and the  the longest range twinengined aircraft in the world the  was the first boeing airliner to feature a flybywire system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the european airbus into boeings traditional market this aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using computeraided design cad techniques the  was also the first airplane to be certified for  minute etops at entry into service by the faa also in the mids the company developed the revamped version of the  known as the  nextgeneration or ng it has since become the fastestselling version of the  in history and on april   sales passed those of the classic  with a followup order for  aircraft from southwest airlines in  boeing chose to demolish the headquarters complex on east marginal way south instead of upgrading it to

seattle in  boeing acquired rockwells aerospace and defense units the rockwell business units became a subsidiary of boeing named boeing north american inc in august  boeing merged with mcdonnell douglas in a us billion stock swap under the name the boeing company however this name had actually been boeings official name previously adopted on may   following the merger the mcdonnell douglas md was renamed the boeing  and the production of the md was limited to the freighter version boeing introduced a new corporate identity with completion of the merger incorporating the boeing logo type and a stylized version of the mcdonnell douglas symbol which was derived from the douglas aircraft logo from the s aerospace analyst scott hamilton heavily criticized the ceo and his deputy philip m condit and harry stonecipher for thinking of their personal benefit first and with it causing the problems hitting boeing many years later instead of investing the huge cash reserve to build new airplanes they initiated a program to buy back boeing stock for more than us billionimportance –edit international space station boeing everett factory in  in january  boeing chose to expand its

last civil aircraft to be designed by mcdonnell douglas would cease production in  the  was in danger of cancellation as well with the  replacing it but orders for the freighter version extended the program after several decades of success boeing lost ground to airbus and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in  multiple boeing projects were pursued and then canceled notably the sonic cruiser a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the speed of sound cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as  percent it was launched in  along with a new advertising campaign to promote the companys new motto forever new frontiers and to rehabilitate its image however the planes fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the september  attacks and the subsequent weak economy and increase in fuel prices subsequently boeing streamlined its production and turned its attention to a new model the boeing  dreamliner using much of the technology developed for the sonic cruiser but in a more conventional aircraft designed for maximum efficiency the company also launched new variants of its successful  and  models the  proved to be a highly popular choice with airlines and won a record number of prelaunch orders with delays to airbus a program several airlines threatened to switch their a orders to boeings new  version the  airbuss response to the  the a received a lukewarm response at first when it was announced as an improved version of the a and then gained significant orders when airbus promised an entirely new

who argued that the lease was more expensive than an outright purchase the dod announced a revised lease of  aircraft and purchase of  in december  the pentagon announced the project was to be frozen while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers darleen druyun who began employment at boeing in january was begun the fallout of this resulted in the resignation of boeing ceo philip m condit and the termination of cfo michael m sears harry stonecipher former mcdonnell douglas ceo and boeing coo replaced condit on an interim basis druyun pleaded guilty to inflating the price of the contract to favor her future employer and to passing information on the competing airbus a mrtt bid in october  she received a jail sentence for corruption in march  the boeing board forced president and ceo harry stonecipher to resign boeing said an internal investigation revealed a consensual relationship between stonecipher and a female executive that was inconsistent with boeings code of conduct and would impair his ability to lead the company james a bell served as interim ceo in addition to his normal duties as boeings cfo until the appointment of jim mcnerney as the new chairman president and ceo on june   industrial espionageedit in june  lockheed martin sued boeing alleging that the company had resorted to industrial espionage in  to win the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv competition lockheed martin claimed that the former employee kenneth branch who went to work for mcdonnell douglas and boeing passed nearly  pages of proprietary documents to his new employers lockheed martin argued that these documents allowed boeing to win  of the  tendered military satellite launches in july  boeing was penalized with the pentagon stripping seven launches away from the company and awarding them to lockheed martin furthermore the company was forbidden to bid for rocket contracts for a twentymonth period which expired in march  in early september  it was reported that boeing was negotiating a settlement with the us department of justice in which it would pay up to  million to cover this and the darleen druyun scandal  euus agreement notesedit until the late s the us had a near monopoly in the large civil aircraft lca sector the airbus consortium created in  started competing effectively in the s at that stage the us became concerned about the european competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the european governments for the developments of the early models of the airbus family this became a major issue of contention as the european side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to us lca manufacturers through nasa and defense programs the eu and the us started bilateral negotiations for the limitation of government subsidies to the lca sector in the late s negotiations were concluded in  with the signing of the ecus agreement on trade in large civil aircraft which imposes disciplines on government support on both sides of the atlantic which are significantly stricter than the relevant world trade organization wto rules notably the agreement regulates in detail the forms and limits of government support prescribes transparency obligations and commits the parties to avoiding trade disputes subsidy disputesedit in  the eu and the us agreed to discuss a possible revision of the  euus agreement provided that this would cover all forms of subsidies including those used in the us and in particular the subsidies for the boeing  the first new aircraft to be launched by boeing for  years in october  the us began legal proceedings at the wto by requesting wto consultations on european launch investment to airbus the us also unilaterally withdrew from the  euus agreement the us claimed airbus had violated a  bilateral accord when it received what boeing deemed unfair subsidies from several european governments airbus responded by filing a separate complaint contesting that boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the us government moreover the eu also complained that the investment subsidies from japanese airlines violated the accord on january   boeing and airbus agreed that they would attempt to find a solution to the dispute outside of the wto however in june  boeing and the united states government reopened the trade dispute with the wto claiming that airbus had received illegal subsidies from european governments airbus has also responded to this claim against boeing reopening the dispute and also accusing boeing of receiving subsidies from the us government on september   the wto ruled that boeing had received billions of dollars in government subsidies boeing responded by stating that the ruling was a fraction of the size of the ruling against airbus and that it required few changes in its operations boeing has received  billion in support from washington state future conceptsedit in may  four concept designs being examined by boeing were outlined in the seattle times based on corporate internal documents the research aims in two directions lowcost airplanes and environmentalfriendly planes codenamed after the wellknown muppets a design team known as the green team concentrated primarily on reducing fuel usage all four designs illustrated rearengine layouts fozzie employs open rotors and offers a lower cruising speed beaker has very thin long wings with the ability to partially foldup to facilitate easier taxiing kermit kruiser has forward swept wings over which are positioned its engines with the aim of lowering noise below due to the reflection of the exhaust signature upward honeydew with its delta wing design resembles a marriage of the flying wing concept and the traditional tube fuselage as with most concepts these designs are only in the exploratory stage intended to help boeing evaluate the potentials of such radical technologies boeing recently patented its own force field

the boeing model  at the museum of flight william e boeing in  in march  william e boeing bought heaths shipyard in seattle on the duwamish river which later became his first airplane factory boeing was incorporated in seattle by william boeing on july   as pacific aero products co boeing was later incorporated in delaware the original certificate of incorporation was filed with the secretary of state of delaware on july   boeing who studied at yale university worked initially in the timber industry where he became wealthy and learned about wooden structures this knowledge proved invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of airplanes the company stayed in seattle to take advantage of the local supply of spruce wood william boeing founded his company a few months after the june  maiden flight of one of the two bw seaplanes built with the assistance of george conrad westervelt a us navy engineer boeing and westervelt decided to build the bw seaplane after having flown in a curtiss aircraft boeing bought a glenn martin flying birdcage seaplane so called because of all the guywires holding it together and was taught to fly by glenn martin himself boeing soon crashed the birdcage and when martin informed boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time he and his friend cdr gc westervelt agreed to build a better airplane and soon produced the bw seaplane this first boeing airplane was assembled in a lakeside hangar located on the northeast shore of seattles lake union many of boeings early planes were seaplanes on april   the us declared war on germany and later in the year entered world war i on may   the company became the boeing airplane company with the us entering the war boeing knew that the us navy needed seaplanes for training so boeing shipped two new model cs to pensacola florida where the planes were flown for the navy the navy liked the model c and ordered  more the company moved its operations to a larger former shipbuilding facility known as boeing plant  located on the lower duwamish river washington state boeings original logo when world war i ended in  a large surplus of cheap used military planes flooded the commercial airplane market preventing aircraft companies from selling any new airplanes driving many out of business others including boeing started selling other products boeing built dressers counters and furniture along with flatbottom boats called sea sleds in  the boeing b flying boat made its first flight it accommodated one pilot and two passengers and some mail over the course of eight years it made international airmail flights from seattle to victoria british columbia on may   the boeing model  made its first flight it was the first plane to fly over mount rainier in  boeing entered competition against curtiss to develop a pursuit fighter for the us army air service although curtiss finished its design first and was awarded the contract boeing continued to develop its pw fighter that plane along with the boeing p fb fighter made boeing a leading manufacturer of fighters over the course of the next decade in  boeing built its model  mail plane for the us government to use on airmail routes in  an improved version of this plane was built the model a which won the us post offices contract to deliver mail between san francisco and chicago the a also had a passenger cabin that accommodated two that same year boeing created an airline named boeing air transport which merged a year later with pacific air transport and the boeing airplane company the first airmail flight for the airline was on july   the company changed its name to united aircraft and transport corporation in  and acquired pratt  whitney hamilton standard propeller company and chance vought united aircraft then purchased national air transport in  on july   the passenger boeing  biplane made its first flight with three engines it was boeings first plane built with the sole intention of being a passenger transport an upgraded version the a carrying eighteen passengers made its first flight in september  s and sedit in  the monomail a lowwing monoplane that carried mail was built built entirely out of metal it was very fast and aerodynamic and had retractable landing gear in fact its design was so revolutionary that the engines and propellers of the time could not handle the plane by the time controllable pitch propellers were developed boeing was building its model  airliner two monomails were built the second one the model  had a passenger cabin in  the boeing  was introduced the first truly modern airliner the  was an allmetal lowwing monoplane that was much faster safer and easier to fly than other passenger aircraft for example it was the first twin engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine in an era of unreliable engines this vastly improved flight safety boeing built the first sixty aircraft exclusively for its own united airlines subsidiarys operations this badly hurt competing airlines and was typical of the anticompetitive corporate behavior that the us government sought to prohibit at the time the air mail act of  prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella so the company split into three smaller companies – boeing airplane company united airlines and united aircraft corporation the precursor to united technologies as a result william boeing sold off his shares and left boeing clairmont claire l egtvedt who had become boeings president in  became the chairman as well he believed the companys future was in building bigger planes work began in  on boeing plant  to accommodate the production of larger modern aircraft boeing b assembly line in wichita kansas  boeing  stratocruiser shortly after an agreement with pan american world airways pan am was reached to develop and build a commercial flying boat able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes the first flight of the boeing  clipper was in june  it was the largest civil aircraft of its time with a capacity of  passengers on day flights and of  passengers on night flights one year later the first regular passenger service from the us to the uk was inaugurated subsequently other routes were opened so that soon pan am flew with the boeing  to destinations all over the world in  boeing completed work on its model  stratoliner this was the worlds first pressurizedcabin transport aircraft and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of  feet  m – above most weather disturbances it was based on the b using the same wings tail and engines during world war ii boeing built a large number of b and b bombers boeing ranked twelfth among united states corporations in the value of wartime production contracts many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war in the beginning of march  production had been scaled up in such a manner that over  planes were built each month to prevent an attack from the air the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items during these years of war the leading aircraft companies of the us cooperated the boeingdesigned b bomber was assembled also by lockheed aircraft corp and douglas aircraft co while the b was assembled also by bell aircraft co and by glenn l martin company after the war most orders of bombers were canceled and  people lost their jobs at boeingcitation needed the company aimed to recover quickly by selling its stratocruiser the model  a luxurious fourengine commercial airliner developed from the b however sales of this model were not as expected and boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situationcitation needed the company successfully sold military derivatives of the stratocruiser such as the c adapted for troop transportation and the kc for aerial refuelingcitation needed sedit the boeing  in british overseas airways corporation boac livery  boeing developed military jets such as the b stratojet and b stratofortress bombers in the lates and into the s during the early s boeing used company funds to develop the – jet airliner demonstrator that led to the kc stratotanker and boeing  jetliner some of these were built at boeings facilities in wichita kansas which existed from  to  in the mids technology had advanced significantly which gave boeing the opportunity to develop and manufacture new products one of the first was the guided shortrange missile used to intercept enemy aircraft by that time the cold war had become a fact of life and boeing used its shortrange missile technology to develop and build an intercontinental missile in  boeing began delivery of its  the united states first commercial jet airliner in response to the british de havilland comet french sud aviation caravelle and soviet tupolev tu which were the worlds first generation of commercial jet aircraft with the  a fourengine passenger airliner the us became a leader in commercial jet manufacture a few years later boeing added a second version of this aircraft the boeing  which was slightly faster and had a shorter range boeing was a major producer of small turbine engines during the s and s the engines represented one of the companys major efforts to expand its product base beyond military aircraft after world war ii development on the gasoline turbine engine started in  and boeings gas turbines were designated models     and  boeing built  engines before production ceased in april  many applications of the boeing gas turbine engines were considered to be firsts including the first turbinepowered helicopter and boat sedit the  and  formed the backbone of many major airline fleets through the end of the s including united  shown and pan am  shown lufthansa boeing  a boeing  the bestselling aircraft vertol aircraft corporation was acquired by boeing in  and was reorganized as boeings vertol division the twinrotor ch chinook produced by vertol took its first flight in  this heavylift helicopter remains a workhorse vehicle up to the present day in  vertol also began production of the ch sea knight in december  boeing announced the model  jetliner which went into commercial service about three years later different passenger freight and convertible freighter variants were developed for the  the  was the first commercial jetliner to reach  sales boeing won a contract in  to manufacture the sic stage of the saturn v rocket manufactured at the michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana in  boeing president william m allen asked malcolm t stamper to spearhead production of the new  airliner on which the companys future was riding this was a monumental engineering and management challenge and included construction of the worlds biggest factory in which to build the  at everett washington a plant which is the size of  football fields in  boeing introduced another short and mediumrange airliner the twinengine  it has become since then the bestselling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history several versions have been developed mainly to increase seating capacity and range the  remains in production as of april  the rollout ceremonies for the first  took place in  at the massive new factory in everett about an hours drive from boeings seattle home the aircraft made its first flight a year later the first commercial flight occurred in  the  has an intercontinental range and a larger seating capacity than boeings previous aircraft boeing also developed hydrofoils in the s the screwdriven uss high point pch was an experimental submarine hunter the patrol hydrofoil uss tucumcari pgh was more successful only one was built but it saw service in vietnam and europe before running aground in  its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the example for the later pegasusclass patrol hydrofoils and the model  jetfoil ferries in the s the tucumcari and later boats were produced in renton while the navy hydrofoils were withdrawn from service in the late s the boeing jetfoils are still in service in asia sedit in the early s boeing suffered from the simultaneous decline in vietnam war military spending the slowing of the space program as project apollo neared completion the recession of – and the companys  billion debt as it built the new  airliner boeing did not receive any orders for more than a year its bet for the future the  was delayed in production by three months because of problems with its pratt  whitney engines another problem was that in  the us congress decided to stop funding for the development of the supersonic  boeings answer to the britishfrench concorde forcing the company to discontinue the project commercial airplane group by far the largest unit of boeing went from  employees in  to  in  each unemployed boeing employee cost at least one other job and unemployment rose to  percent the highest in the united statescitation needed housing vacancy rates rose to  percent from  percent in citation needed uhaul dealerships ran out of trailers because so many people moved out a billboard appeared near the airport– will the last person leaving seattle  turn out the lights in january  the first  a fourengine longrange airliner flew its first commercial flight with pan american world airways the  changed the airline industry providing much larger seating capacity than any other airliner in production the company has delivered over  boeing s the  has undergone continuous improvements to keep it technologically uptodate larger versions have also been developed by stretching the upper deck the newest version of the  the  is in production as of  boeing launched three jetfoil  hydrofoils that were acquired in  for service in the hawaiian islands when the service ended in  the three hydrofoils were acquired by far east hydrofoil for service between hong kong and macau during the s boeing also developed the us standard light rail vehicle which has been used in san francisco boston and morgantown west virginia sedit the narrow body boeing  replaced the  this example is in turkmenistan airlines livery the boeing  replaced the boeing  this example is in qantas livery in  the economic situation began to improve boeing assembled its th  passenger aircraft during the following years commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces as passenger air traffic increased competition was harder mainly from airbus a european newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing boeing had to offer new aircraft and developed the singleaisle  the larger twinaisle  and upgraded versions of the  an important project of these years was the space shuttle to which boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the apollo era boeing participated also with other products in the space program and was the first contractor for the international space station program during the decade several military projects went into production including boeing support of the stealth b bomber as part of an industry team led by northrop boeing built the outboard portion of the b stealth bomber wing the aft center fuselage section landing gear fuel system and weapons delivery system at its peak in  the b was the largest military program at boeing employing about  people the same year the national aeronautic association of the usa awarded the b design team the collier trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in america the first b rolled out of the bombers final assembly facility in palmdale california in november  and it flew for the first time on july   the avenger air defense system and a new generation of shortrange missiles also went into production during these years boeing was very active in upgrading existing military equipment and developing new ones boeing also contributed to wind power development with the experimental mod wind turbines for nasa and the united states department of energy and the modb for hawaii sedit air france er boeing was one of seven competing companies that bid for the advanced tactical fighter boeing agreed to team with general dynamics and lockheed so that all three companies would participate in the development if one of the three companies designs was selected the lockheed design was eventually selected and developed into the f raptor in april  boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time the twinengine  with a seating capacity of approximately  to  passengers in a typical threeclass layout in between the  and the  the longest range twinengined aircraft in the world the  was the first boeing airliner to feature a flybywire system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the european airbus into boeings traditional market this aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using computeraided design cad techniques the  was also the first airplane to be certified for  minute etops at entry into service by the faa also in the mids the company developed the revamped version of the  known as the  nextgeneration or ng it has since become the fastestselling version of the  in history and on april   sales passed those of the classic  with a followup order for  aircraft from southwest airlines in  boeing chose to demolish the headquarters complex on east marginal way south instead of upgrading it to match new seismic standards the headquarters were moved to an adjacent building and the facility was demolished in  in  boeing was headquartered on east marginal way south by king county airport in seattle in  boeing acquired rockwells aerospace and defense units the rockwell business units became a subsidiary of boeing named boeing north american inc in august  boeing merged with mcdonnell douglas in a us billion stock swap under the name the boeing company however this name had actually been boeings official name previously adopted on may   following the merger the mcdonnell douglas md was renamed the boeing  and the production of the md was limited to the freighter version boeing introduced a new corporate identity with completion of the merger incorporating the boeing logo type and a stylized version of the mcdonnell douglas symbol which was derived from the douglas aircraft logo from the s aerospace analyst scott hamilton heavily criticized the ceo and his deputy philip m condit and harry stonecipher for thinking of their personal benefit first and with it causing the problems hitting boeing many years later instead of investing the huge cash reserve to build new airplanes they initiated a program to buy back boeing stock for more than us billionimportance –edit international space station boeing everett factory in  in january  boeing chose to expand its presence in another aerospace field of satellite communications by purchasing hughes electronics hughes space and communications company which had pioneered the satellite communications field in september  boeing moved its corporate headquarters from seattle to chicago chicago dallas and denver – vying to become the new home of the worlds largest aerospace concern – all had offered packages of multimilliondollar tax breaks its offices are located in the fulton river district just outside the loop chicago on october   boeing lost to its rival lockheed martin in the fierce competition for the multibilliondollar joint strike fighter contract boeings entry the x was rejected in favor of lockheeds x entrant boeing continues to serve as the prime contractor on the international space station and has built several of the major components boeing began development of the kc aerial refueling tanker in the early s italy and japan ordered four kcs each after development delays and faa certification boeing delivered the tankers to japan from  with the second kc following on march  to  italy received its four kc during  in  boeing ended production of the  after  aircraft were produced more advanced stretched versions of the  were beginning to compete against the  and the planned  was to fill much of the top end of the  market also that year boeing announced that the  the last civil aircraft to be designed by mcdonnell douglas would cease production in  the  was in danger of cancellation as well with the  replacing it but orders for the freighter version extended the program after several decades of success boeing lost ground to airbus and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in  multiple boeing projects were pursued and then canceled notably the sonic cruiser a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the speed of sound cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as  percent it was launched in  along with a new advertising campaign to promote the companys new motto forever new frontiers and to rehabilitate its image however the planes fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the september  attacks and the subsequent weak economy and increase in fuel prices subsequently boeing streamlined its production and turned its attention to a new model the boeing  dreamliner using much of the technology developed for the sonic cruiser but in a more conventional aircraft designed for maximum efficiency the company also launched new variants of its successful  and  models the  proved to be a highly popular choice with airlines and won a record number of prelaunch orders with delays to airbus a program several airlines threatened to switch their a orders to boeings new  version the  airbuss response to the  the a received a lukewarm response at first when it was announced as an improved version of the a and then gained significant orders when airbus promised an entirely new design the  program has encountered delays with the first flight not occurring until late  after regulatory approval boeing formed a joint venture united launch alliance with its competitor lockheed martin on december   the new venture is the largest provider of rocket launch services to the us government on august   boeing sold its rocketdyne rocket engine division to pratt  whitney on may   boeing agreed to purchase dallas texasbased aviall inc for  billion and retain  million in debt aviall inc and its subsidiaries aviall services inc and ils formed a wholly owned subsidiary of boeing commercial aviation services bcas realizing that increasing numbers of passengers have become reliant on their computers to stay in touch boeing introduced connexion by boeing a satellite based internet connectivity service that promised air travelers unprecedented access to the world wide web the company debuted the product to journalists in  receiving generally favorable reviews however facing competition from cheaper options such as cellular networks it proved too difficult to sell to most airlines in august  after a short and unsuccessful search for a buyer for the business boeing chose to discontinue the service on august   nasa selected boeing as the manufacturing contractor for the liquidfueled upper stage of the ares i rocket the stage based on both apollosaturn and space

combat systems program the fcs program was canceled in june  with all remaining systems swept into the bct modernization program boeing works jointly with saic in the bct modernization program like the fcs program but the us army will play a greater role in creating baseline vehicles and will only contract others for accessories defense secretary robert m gates shift in defense spending to make tough choices about specific systems and defense priorities based solely on the national interest and then stick to those decisions over time hit boeing especially hard because of their heavy

while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers darleen druyun who began employment at boeing in january was begun the fallout of this resulted in the resignation of boeing ceo philip m condit and the termination of cfo michael m sears harry stonecipher former mcdonnell douglas ceo and boeing coo replaced condit on an interim basis druyun pleaded guilty to inflating the price of the contract to favor her future employer and to passing information on the competing airbus a mrtt bid in october  she received a jail sentence for corruption in march  the boeing board forced president and ceo harry stonecipher to resign boeing said an internal investigation revealed a consensual relationship between stonecipher and a female executive that was inconsistent with boeings code of conduct and would impair his ability to lead the company james a bell served as interim ceo in addition to his normal duties as boeings cfo until the appointment of jim mcnerney as the new chairman president and ceo on june   industrial espionageedit in june  lockheed martin sued boeing alleging that the company had resorted to industrial espionage in  to win the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv competition lockheed martin claimed that the former employee kenneth branch who went to work for mcdonnell douglas and boeing passed nearly  pages of proprietary documents to his new employers lockheed martin argued that these documents allowed boeing to win  of the  tendered military satellite launches in july  boeing was penalized with the pentagon stripping seven launches away from the company and awarding them to lockheed martin furthermore the company was forbidden to bid for rocket contracts for a twentymonth period which expired in march  in early september  it was reported that boeing was negotiating a settlement with the us department of justice in which it would pay up to  million to cover this and the darleen druyun scandal  euus agreement notesedit until the late s the us had a near monopoly in the large civil aircraft lca sector the airbus consortium created in  started competing effectively in the s at that stage the us became concerned about the european competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the european governments for the developments of the early models of the airbus family this became a major issue of contention as the european side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to us lca manufacturers through nasa and defense programs the eu and the us started bilateral negotiations for the limitation of government subsidies to the lca sector in the late s negotiations were concluded in  with the signing of the ecus agreement on trade in large civil aircraft which imposes disciplines on government support on both sides of the atlantic which are significantly stricter than the relevant world trade organization wto rules notably the agreement regulates in detail the forms and limits of government support prescribes transparency obligations and commits the parties to avoiding trade disputes subsidy disputesedit in  the eu and the us agreed to discuss a possible revision of the  euus agreement provided that this would cover all forms of subsidies including those used in the us and in particular the subsidies for the boeing  the first new aircraft to be launched by boeing for  years in october  the us began legal proceedings at the wto by requesting wto consultations on european launch investment to airbus the us also unilaterally withdrew from the  euus agreement the us claimed airbus had violated a  bilateral accord when it received what boeing deemed unfair subsidies from several european governments airbus responded by filing a separate complaint contesting that boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the us government moreover the eu also complained that the investment subsidies from japanese airlines violated the accord on january   boeing and airbus agreed that they would attempt to find a solution to the dispute outside of the wto however in june  boeing and the united states government reopened the trade dispute with the wto claiming that airbus had received illegal subsidies from european governments airbus has also responded to this claim against boeing reopening the dispute and also accusing boeing of receiving subsidies from the us government on september   the wto ruled that boeing had received billions of dollars in government subsidies boeing responded by stating that the ruling was a fraction of the size of the ruling against airbus and that it required few changes in its operations boeing has received  billion in support from washington state future conceptsedit in may  four concept designs

cruising speed beaker has very thin long wings with the ability to partially foldup to facilitate easier taxiing kermit kruiser has forward swept wings over which are positioned its engines with the aim of lowering noise below due to the reflection of the exhaust signature upward honeydew with its delta wing design resembles a marriage of the flying wing concept and the traditional tube fuselage as with most concepts these designs are only in the exploratory stage intended to help boeing evaluate the potentials of such radical technologies boeing recently patented its own force field

the boeing model  at the museum of flight william e boeing in  in march  william e boeing bought heaths shipyard in seattle on the duwamish river which later became his first airplane factory boeing was incorporated in seattle by william boeing on july   as pacific aero products co boeing was later incorporated in delaware the original certificate of incorporation was filed with the secretary of state of delaware on july   boeing who studied at yale university worked initially in the timber industry where he became wealthy and learned about wooden structures this knowledge proved invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of airplanes the company stayed in seattle to take advantage of the local supply of spruce wood william boeing founded his company a few months after the june  maiden flight of one of the two bw seaplanes built with the assistance of george conrad westervelt a us navy engineer boeing and westervelt decided to build the bw seaplane after having flown in a curtiss aircraft boeing bought a glenn martin flying birdcage seaplane so called because of all the guywires holding it together and was taught to fly by glenn martin himself boeing soon crashed the birdcage and when martin informed boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time he and his friend cdr gc westervelt agreed to build a better airplane and soon produced the bw seaplane this first boeing airplane was assembled in a lakeside hangar located on the northeast shore of seattles lake union many of boeings early planes were seaplanes on april   the us declared war on germany and later in the year entered world war i on may   the company became the boeing airplane company with the us entering the war boeing knew that the us navy needed seaplanes for training so boeing shipped two new model cs to pensacola florida where the planes were flown for the navy the navy liked the model c and ordered  more the company moved its operations to a larger former shipbuilding facility known as boeing plant  located on the lower duwamish river washington state boeings original logo when world war i ended in  a large surplus of cheap used military planes flooded the commercial airplane market preventing aircraft companies from selling any new airplanes driving many out of business others including boeing started selling other products boeing built dressers counters and furniture along with flatbottom boats called sea sleds in  the boeing b flying boat made its first flight it accommodated one pilot and two passengers and some mail over the course of eight years it made international airmail flights from seattle to victoria british columbia on may   the boeing model  made its first flight it was the first plane to fly over mount rainier in  boeing entered competition against curtiss to develop a pursuit fighter for the us army air service although curtiss finished its design first and was awarded the contract boeing continued to develop its pw fighter that plane along with the boeing p fb fighter made boeing a leading manufacturer of fighters over the course of the next decade in  boeing built its model  mail plane for the us government to use on airmail routes in  an improved version of this plane was built the model a which won the us post offices contract to deliver mail between san francisco and chicago the a also had a passenger cabin that accommodated two that same year boeing created an airline named boeing air transport which merged a year later with pacific air transport and the boeing airplane company the first airmail flight for the airline was on july   the company changed its name to united aircraft and transport corporation in  and acquired pratt  whitney hamilton standard propeller company and chance vought united aircraft then purchased national air transport in  on july   the passenger boeing  biplane made its first flight with three engines it was boeings first plane built with the sole intention of being a passenger transport an upgraded version the a carrying eighteen passengers made its first flight in september  s and sedit in  the monomail a lowwing monoplane that carried mail was built built entirely out of metal it was very fast and aerodynamic and had retractable landing gear in fact its design was so revolutionary that the engines and propellers of the time could not handle the plane by the time controllable pitch propellers were developed boeing was building its model  airliner two monomails were built the second one the model  had a passenger cabin in  the boeing  was introduced the first truly modern airliner the  was an allmetal lowwing monoplane that was much faster safer and easier to fly than other passenger aircraft for example it was the first twin engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine in an era of unreliable engines this vastly improved flight safety boeing built the first sixty aircraft exclusively for its own united airlines subsidiarys operations this badly hurt competing airlines and was typical of the anticompetitive corporate behavior that the us government sought to prohibit at the time the air mail act of  prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella so the company split into three smaller companies – boeing airplane company united airlines and united aircraft corporation the precursor to united technologies as a result william boeing sold off his shares and left boeing clairmont claire l egtvedt who had become boeings president in  became the chairman as well he believed the companys future was in building bigger planes work began in  on boeing plant  to accommodate the production of larger modern aircraft boeing b assembly line in wichita kansas  boeing  stratocruiser shortly after an agreement with pan american world airways pan am was reached to develop and build a commercial flying boat able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes the first flight of the boeing  clipper was in june  it was the largest civil aircraft of its time with a capacity of  passengers on day flights and of  passengers on night flights one year later the first regular passenger service from the us to the uk was inaugurated subsequently other routes were opened so that soon pan am flew with the boeing  to destinations all over the world in  boeing completed work on its model  stratoliner this was the worlds first pressurizedcabin transport aircraft and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of  feet  m – above most weather disturbances it was based on the b using the same wings tail and engines during world war ii boeing built a large number of b and b bombers boeing ranked twelfth among united states corporations in the value of wartime production contracts many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war in the beginning of march  production had been scaled up in such a manner that over  planes were built each month to prevent an attack from the air the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items during these years of war the leading aircraft companies of the us cooperated the boeingdesigned b bomber was assembled also by lockheed aircraft corp and douglas aircraft co while the b was assembled also by bell aircraft co and by glenn l martin company after the war most orders of bombers were canceled and  people lost their jobs at boeingcitation needed the company aimed to recover quickly by selling its stratocruiser the model  a luxurious fourengine commercial airliner developed from the b however sales of this model were not as expected and boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situationcitation needed the company successfully sold military derivatives of the stratocruiser such as the c adapted for troop transportation and the kc for aerial refuelingcitation needed sedit the boeing  in british overseas airways corporation boac livery  boeing developed military jets such as the b stratojet and b stratofortress bombers in the lates and into the s during the early s boeing used company funds to develop the – jet airliner demonstrator that led to the kc stratotanker and boeing  jetliner some of these were built at boeings facilities in wichita kansas which existed from  to  in the mids technology had advanced significantly which gave boeing the opportunity to develop and manufacture new products one of the first was the guided shortrange missile used to intercept enemy aircraft by that time the cold war had become a fact of life and boeing used its shortrange missile technology to develop and build an intercontinental missile in  boeing began delivery of its  the united states first commercial jet airliner in response to the british de havilland comet french sud aviation caravelle and soviet tupolev tu which were the worlds first generation of commercial jet aircraft with the  a fourengine passenger airliner the us became a leader in commercial jet manufacture a few years later boeing added a second version of this aircraft the boeing  which was slightly faster and had a shorter range boeing was a major producer of small turbine engines during the s and s the engines represented one of the companys major efforts to expand its product base beyond military aircraft after world war ii development on the gasoline turbine engine started in  and boeings gas turbines were designated models     and  boeing built  engines before production ceased in april  many applications of the boeing gas turbine engines were considered to be firsts including the first turbinepowered helicopter and boat sedit the  and  formed the backbone of many major airline fleets through the end of the s including united  shown and pan am  shown lufthansa boeing  a boeing  the bestselling aircraft vertol aircraft corporation was acquired by boeing in  and was reorganized as boeings vertol division the twinrotor ch chinook produced by vertol took its first flight in  this heavylift helicopter remains a workhorse vehicle up to the present day in  vertol also began production of the ch sea knight in december  boeing announced the model  jetliner which went into commercial service about three years later different passenger freight and convertible freighter variants were developed for the  the  was the first commercial jetliner to reach  sales boeing won a contract in  to manufacture the sic stage of the saturn v rocket manufactured at the michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana in  boeing president william m allen asked malcolm t stamper to spearhead production of the new  airliner on which the companys future was riding this was a monumental engineering and management challenge and included construction of the worlds biggest factory in which to build the  at everett washington a plant which is the size of  football fields in  boeing introduced another short and mediumrange airliner the twinengine  it has become since then the bestselling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history several versions have been developed mainly to increase seating capacity and range the  remains in production as of april  the rollout ceremonies for the first  took place in  at the massive new factory in everett about an hours drive from boeings seattle home the aircraft made its first flight a year later the first commercial flight occurred in  the  has an intercontinental range and a larger seating capacity than boeings previous aircraft boeing also developed hydrofoils in the s the screwdriven uss high point pch was an experimental submarine hunter the patrol hydrofoil uss tucumcari pgh was more successful only one was built but it saw service in vietnam and europe before running aground in  its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the example for the later pegasusclass patrol hydrofoils and the model  jetfoil ferries in the s the tucumcari and later boats were produced in renton while the navy hydrofoils were withdrawn from service in the late s the boeing jetfoils are still in service in asia sedit in the early s boeing suffered from the simultaneous decline in vietnam war military spending the slowing of the space program as project apollo neared completion the recession of – and the companys  billion debt as it built the new  airliner boeing did not receive any orders for more than a year its bet for the future the  was delayed in production by three months because of problems with its pratt  whitney engines another problem was that in  the us congress decided to stop funding for the development of the supersonic  boeings answer to the britishfrench concorde forcing the company to discontinue the project commercial airplane group by far the largest unit of boeing went from  employees in  to  in  each unemployed boeing employee cost at least one other job and unemployment rose to  percent the highest in the united statescitation needed housing vacancy rates rose to  percent from  percent in citation needed uhaul dealerships ran out of trailers because so many people moved out a billboard appeared near the airport– will the last person leaving seattle  turn out the lights in january  the first  a fourengine longrange airliner flew its first commercial flight with pan american world airways the  changed the airline industry providing much larger seating capacity than any other airliner in production the company has delivered over  boeing s the  has undergone continuous improvements to keep it technologically uptodate larger versions have also been developed by stretching the upper deck the newest version of the  the  is in production as of  boeing launched three jetfoil  hydrofoils that were acquired in  for service in the hawaiian islands when the service ended in  the three hydrofoils were acquired by far east hydrofoil for service between hong kong and macau during the s boeing also developed the us standard light rail vehicle which has been used in san francisco boston and morgantown west virginia sedit the narrow body boeing  replaced the  this example is in turkmenistan airlines livery the boeing  replaced the boeing  this example is in qantas livery in  the economic situation began to improve boeing assembled its th  passenger aircraft during the following years commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces as passenger air traffic increased competition was harder mainly from airbus a european newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing boeing had to offer new aircraft and developed the singleaisle  the larger twinaisle  and upgraded versions of the  an important project of these years was the space shuttle to which boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the apollo era boeing participated also with other products in the space program and was the first contractor for the international space station program during the decade several military projects went into production including boeing support of the stealth b bomber as part of an industry team led by northrop boeing built the outboard portion of the b stealth bomber wing the aft center fuselage section landing gear fuel system and weapons delivery system at its peak in  the b was the largest military program at boeing employing about  people the same year the national aeronautic association of the usa awarded the b design team the collier trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in america the first b rolled out of the bombers final assembly facility in palmdale california in november  and it flew for the first time on july   the avenger air defense system and a new generation of shortrange missiles also went into production during these years boeing was very active in upgrading existing military equipment and developing new ones boeing also contributed to wind power development with the experimental mod wind turbines for nasa and the united states department of energy and the modb for hawaii sedit air france er boeing was one of seven competing companies that bid for the advanced tactical fighter boeing agreed to team with general dynamics and lockheed so that all three companies would participate in the development if one of the three companies designs was selected the lockheed design was eventually selected and developed into the f raptor in april  boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time the twinengine  with a seating capacity of approximately  to  passengers in a typical threeclass layout in between the  and the  the longest range twinengined aircraft in the world the  was the first boeing airliner to feature a flybywire system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the european airbus into boeings traditional market this aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using computeraided design cad techniques the  was also the first airplane to be certified for  minute etops at entry into service by the faa also in the mids the company developed the revamped version of the  known as the  nextgeneration or ng it has since become the fastestselling version of the  in history and on april   sales passed those of the classic  with a followup order for  aircraft from southwest airlines in  boeing chose to demolish the headquarters complex on east marginal way south instead of upgrading it to match new seismic standards the headquarters were moved to an adjacent building and the facility was demolished in  in  boeing was headquartered on east marginal way south by king county airport in seattle in  boeing acquired rockwells aerospace and defense units the rockwell business units became a subsidiary of boeing named boeing north american inc in august  boeing merged with mcdonnell douglas in a us billion stock swap under the name the boeing company however this name had actually been boeings official name previously adopted on may   following the merger the mcdonnell douglas md was renamed the boeing  and the production of the md was limited to the freighter version boeing introduced a new corporate identity with completion of the merger incorporating the boeing logo type and a stylized version of the mcdonnell douglas symbol which was derived from the douglas aircraft logo from the s aerospace analyst scott hamilton heavily criticized the ceo and his deputy philip m condit and harry stonecipher for thinking of their personal benefit first and with it causing the problems hitting boeing many years later instead of investing the huge cash reserve to build new airplanes they initiated a program to buy back boeing stock for more than us billionimportance –edit international space station boeing everett factory in  in january  boeing chose to expand its presence in another aerospace field of satellite communications by purchasing hughes electronics hughes space and communications company which had pioneered the satellite communications field in september  boeing moved its corporate headquarters from seattle to chicago chicago dallas and denver – vying to become the new home of the worlds largest aerospace concern – all had offered packages of multimilliondollar tax breaks its offices are located in the fulton river district just outside the loop chicago on october   boeing lost to its rival lockheed martin in the fierce competition for the multibilliondollar joint strike fighter contract boeings entry the x was rejected in favor of lockheeds x entrant boeing continues to serve as the prime contractor on the international space station and has built several of the major components boeing began development of the kc aerial refueling tanker in the early s italy and japan ordered four kcs each after development delays and faa certification boeing delivered the tankers to japan from  with the second kc following on march  to  italy received its four kc during  in  boeing ended production of the  after  aircraft were produced more advanced stretched versions of the  were beginning to compete against the  and the planned  was to fill much of the top end of the  market also that year boeing announced that the  the last civil aircraft to be designed by mcdonnell douglas would cease production in  the  was in danger of cancellation as well with the  replacing it but orders for the freighter version extended the program after several decades of success boeing lost ground to airbus and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in  multiple boeing projects were pursued and then canceled notably the sonic cruiser a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the speed of sound cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as  percent it was launched in  along with a new advertising campaign to promote the companys new motto forever new frontiers and to rehabilitate its image however the planes fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the september  attacks and the subsequent weak economy and increase in fuel prices subsequently boeing streamlined its production and turned its attention to a new model the boeing  dreamliner using much of the technology developed for the sonic cruiser but in a more conventional aircraft designed for maximum efficiency the company also launched new variants of its successful  and  models the  proved to be a highly popular choice with airlines and won a record number of prelaunch orders with delays to airbus a program several airlines threatened to switch their a orders to boeings new  version the  airbuss response to the  the a received a lukewarm response at first when it was announced as an improved version of the a and then gained significant orders when airbus promised an entirely new design the  program has encountered delays with the first flight not occurring until late  after regulatory approval boeing formed a joint venture united launch alliance with its competitor lockheed martin on december   the new venture is the largest provider of rocket launch services to the us government on august   boeing sold its rocketdyne rocket engine division to pratt  whitney on may   boeing agreed to purchase dallas texasbased aviall inc for  billion and retain  million in debt aviall inc and its subsidiaries aviall services inc and ils formed a wholly owned subsidiary of boeing commercial aviation services bcas realizing that increasing numbers of passengers have become reliant on their computers to stay in touch boeing introduced connexion by boeing a satellite based internet connectivity service that promised air travelers unprecedented access to the world wide web the company debuted the product to journalists in  receiving generally favorable reviews however facing competition from cheaper options such as cellular networks it proved too difficult to sell to most airlines in august  after a short and unsuccessful search for a buyer for the business boeing chose to discontinue the service on august   nasa selected boeing as the manufacturing contractor for the liquidfueled upper stage of the ares i rocket the stage based on both apollosaturn and space shuttle technologies was to be constructed at nasas michoud assembly facility near new orleans boeing constructed the sic stage of the saturn v rocket at this site in the s the boeing  dreamliner on

received the launch contract from the us navy for the p poseidon multimission maritime aircraft an antisubmarine warfare patrol aircraft it has also received orders for the  aewc wedgetail aircraft the company has also introduced new extended range versions of the  these include the er and er the er is the latest and will extend the range of the – to a similar range as the successful – with the capability to fly more passengers due to the addition of two extra emergency exits the recordbreaking lr worldliner presented at the paris air show  the lr worldliner embarked on a wellreceived global demonstration tour in the second half of  showing off its capacity to fly farther than any other commercial aircraft on november   the lr set a world record for the longest nonstop flight the plane which departed from hong kong traveling to london took a longer route which included flying over the us it flew  nautical miles  km during its hour minute flight it was flown by pakistan international airlines pilots and pia was the first airline to fly the lr worldliner on august   boeing agreed to form a jointventure with the large russian titanium producer vsmpoavisma for the machining of titanium forgings the forgings will be used on the  program on december   boeing and vsmpoavisma created a joint venture ural boeing manufacturing and signed a contract on titanium product deliveries until  with boeing planning to invest  billion in russia over the next  years in february  boeing received a contract for  kc us air force tankers at a value of  billion the kc tankers are based on the kc graphic representation of the xm mounted combat system vehicle boeing jointly with science applications international corporation saic were the prime contractors in the us militarys future combat systems program the fcs program was canceled in june  with all remaining systems swept into the bct modernization program boeing works jointly with saic in the bct modernization program like

tough choices about specific systems and defense priorities based solely on the national interest and then stick to those decisions over time hit boeing especially hard because of their heavy involvement with canceled air force projects unethical conductedit in may  the us air force announced it would lease  kc tankers to replace the oldest  of its kcs in november  responding to critics who argued that the lease was more expensive than an outright purchase the dod announced a revised lease of  aircraft and purchase of  in december  the pentagon announced the project was to be frozen while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers darleen druyun who began employment at boeing in january was begun the fallout of this resulted in the resignation of boeing ceo philip m condit and the termination of cfo michael m sears harry stonecipher former mcdonnell douglas ceo and boeing coo replaced condit on an interim basis druyun pleaded guilty to inflating the price of the contract to favor her future employer and to passing information on the competing airbus a mrtt bid in october  she received a jail sentence for corruption in march  the boeing board forced president and ceo harry stonecipher to resign boeing said an internal investigation revealed a consensual relationship between stonecipher and a female executive that was inconsistent with boeings code of conduct and would impair his ability to lead the company james a bell served as interim ceo in addition to his normal duties as boeings cfo until the appointment of jim mcnerney as the new chairman president and ceo on june   industrial espionageedit in june  lockheed martin sued boeing alleging that the company had resorted to industrial espionage in  to win the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv competition lockheed martin claimed that the former employee kenneth branch who went to work for mcdonnell douglas and boeing passed nearly  pages of proprietary documents to his new employers lockheed martin argued that these documents allowed boeing to win  of the  tendered military satellite launches in july  boeing was penalized with the pentagon stripping seven launches away from the company and awarding them to lockheed martin furthermore the company was forbidden to bid for rocket contracts for a twentymonth period which expired in march  in early september  it was reported that boeing was negotiating a settlement with the us department of justice in which it would pay up to  million to cover this and the darleen druyun scandal  euus agreement notesedit until the late s the us had a near monopoly in the large civil aircraft lca sector the airbus consortium created in  started competing effectively in the s at that stage the us became concerned about the european competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the european governments for the developments of the early models of the airbus family this became a major issue of contention as the european side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to us lca manufacturers through nasa and defense programs the eu and the us started bilateral negotiations for the limitation of government subsidies to the lca sector in the late s negotiations were concluded in  with the signing of the ecus agreement on trade in large civil aircraft which imposes disciplines on government support on both sides of the atlantic which are significantly stricter than the relevant world trade organization wto rules notably the agreement regulates in detail the forms and limits of government support prescribes transparency obligations and commits the parties to avoiding trade disputes subsidy disputesedit in  the eu and the us agreed to discuss a possible revision of the  euus agreement provided that this would cover all forms of subsidies including those used in the us and in particular the subsidies for the boeing  the first new aircraft to be launched by boeing for  years in october  the us began legal proceedings at the wto by requesting wto consultations on european launch investment to airbus the us also unilaterally withdrew from the  euus agreement the us claimed airbus had violated a  bilateral accord when it received what boeing deemed unfair subsidies from several european governments airbus responded by filing a separate complaint contesting that boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the us government moreover the eu also complained that the investment subsidies from japanese airlines violated the accord on january   boeing and airbus agreed that they would attempt to find a solution to the dispute outside of the wto however in june  boeing and the united states government reopened the trade dispute with the wto claiming that airbus had received illegal subsidies from european governments airbus has also responded to this claim against boeing reopening the dispute and also accusing boeing of receiving subsidies from the us government on september   the wto ruled that boeing had received billions of dollars in government subsidies boeing responded by stating that the ruling was a fraction of the size of the ruling against airbus and that it required few changes in its operations boeing has received  billion in support from washington state future conceptsedit in may  four concept designs being examined by boeing were outlined in the seattle times based on corporate internal documents the research aims in two directions lowcost airplanes and environmentalfriendly planes codenamed after the wellknown muppets a design team known as the green team concentrated primarily on reducing fuel usage all four designs illustrated rearengine layouts fozzie employs open rotors and offers a lower cruising speed beaker has very thin long wings with the ability to partially foldup to facilitate easier taxiing kermit kruiser has forward swept wings over which are positioned its engines with the aim of lowering noise below due to the reflection of the exhaust signature upward honeydew with its delta wing design resembles a marriage of the flying wing concept and the traditional tube fuselage as with most concepts these designs are only in the exploratory stage intended to help boeing evaluate the potentials of such radical technologies boeing recently patented its own force field technology also known as the shock wave attenuation system that would protect vehicles from shock waves generated by nearby explosions boeing has yet to confirm when they plan to build and test the

aviation biofuel and algae fuel the airline industry is responsible for about  percent of greenhouse gases emitted by the us transportation sector aviations share of the greenhouse gas emissions is poised to grow as air travel increases and ground vehicles use more alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel boeing estimates that biofuels could reduce flightrelated greenhousegas emissions by  to  percent the solution blends algae fuels with existing jet fuel boeing executives said the company is informally collaborating with leading brazilian biofuels maker tecbio aquaflow bionomic of new

the boeing model  at the museum of flight william e boeing in  in march  william e boeing bought heaths shipyard in seattle on the duwamish river which later became his first airplane factory boeing was incorporated in seattle by william boeing on july   as pacific aero products co boeing was later incorporated in delaware the original certificate of incorporation was filed with the secretary of state of delaware on july   boeing who studied at yale university worked initially in the timber industry where he became wealthy and learned about wooden structures this knowledge proved invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of airplanes the company stayed in seattle to take advantage of the local supply of spruce wood william boeing founded his company a few months after the june  maiden flight of one of the two bw seaplanes built with the assistance of george conrad westervelt a us navy engineer boeing and westervelt decided to build the bw seaplane after having flown in a curtiss aircraft boeing bought a glenn martin flying birdcage seaplane so called because of all the guywires holding it together and was taught to fly by glenn martin himself boeing soon crashed the birdcage and when martin informed boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time he and his friend cdr gc westervelt agreed to build a better airplane and soon produced the bw seaplane this first boeing airplane was assembled in a lakeside hangar located on the northeast shore of seattles lake union many of boeings early planes were seaplanes on april   the us declared war on germany and later in the year entered world war i on may   the company became the boeing airplane company with the us entering the war boeing knew that the us navy needed seaplanes for training so boeing shipped two new model cs to pensacola florida where the planes were flown for the navy the navy liked the model c and ordered  more the company moved its operations to a larger former shipbuilding facility known as boeing plant  located on the lower duwamish river washington state boeings original logo when world war i ended in  a large surplus of cheap used military planes flooded the commercial airplane market preventing aircraft companies from selling any new airplanes driving many out of business others including boeing started selling other products boeing built dressers counters and furniture along with flatbottom boats called sea sleds in  the boeing b flying boat made its first flight it accommodated one pilot and two passengers and some mail over the course of eight years it made international airmail flights from seattle to victoria british columbia on may   the boeing model  made its first flight it was the first plane to fly over mount rainier in  boeing entered competition against curtiss to develop a pursuit fighter for the us army air service although curtiss finished its design first and was awarded the contract boeing continued to develop its pw fighter that plane along with the boeing p fb fighter made boeing a leading manufacturer of fighters over the course of the next decade in  boeing built its model  mail plane for the us government to use on airmail routes in  an improved version of this plane was built the model a which won the us post offices contract to deliver mail between san francisco and chicago the a also had a passenger cabin that accommodated two that same year boeing created an airline named boeing air transport which merged a year later with pacific air transport and the boeing airplane company the first airmail flight for the airline was on july   the company changed its name to united aircraft and transport corporation in  and acquired pratt  whitney hamilton standard propeller company and chance vought united aircraft then purchased national air transport in  on july   the passenger boeing  biplane made its first flight with three engines it was boeings first plane built with the sole intention of being a passenger transport an upgraded version the a carrying eighteen passengers made its first flight in september  s and sedit in  the monomail a lowwing monoplane that carried mail was built built entirely out of metal it was very fast and aerodynamic and had retractable landing gear in fact its design was so revolutionary that the engines and propellers of the time could not handle the plane by the time controllable pitch propellers were developed boeing was building its model  airliner two monomails were built the second one the model  had a passenger cabin in  the boeing  was introduced the first truly modern airliner the  was an allmetal lowwing monoplane that was much faster safer and easier to fly than other passenger aircraft for example it was the first twin engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine in an era of unreliable engines this vastly improved flight safety boeing built the first sixty aircraft exclusively for its own united airlines subsidiarys operations this badly hurt competing airlines and was typical of the anticompetitive corporate behavior that the us government sought to prohibit at the time the air mail act of  prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella so the company split into three smaller companies – boeing airplane company united airlines and united aircraft corporation the precursor to united technologies as a result william boeing sold off his shares and left boeing clairmont claire l egtvedt who had become boeings president in  became the chairman as well he believed the companys future was in building bigger planes work began in  on boeing plant  to accommodate the production of larger modern aircraft boeing b assembly line in wichita kansas  boeing  stratocruiser shortly after an agreement with pan american world airways pan am was reached to develop and build a commercial flying boat able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes the first flight of the boeing  clipper was in june  it was the largest civil aircraft of its time with a capacity of  passengers on day flights and of  passengers on night flights one year later the first regular passenger service from the us to the uk was inaugurated subsequently other routes were opened so that soon pan am flew with the boeing  to destinations all over the world in  boeing completed work on its model  stratoliner this was the worlds first pressurizedcabin transport aircraft and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of  feet  m – above most weather disturbances it was based on the b using the same wings tail and engines during world war ii boeing built a large number of b and b bombers boeing ranked twelfth among united states corporations in the value of wartime production contracts many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war in the beginning of march  production had been scaled up in such a manner that over  planes were built each month to prevent an attack from the air the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items during these years of war the leading aircraft companies of the us cooperated the boeingdesigned b bomber was assembled also by lockheed aircraft corp and douglas aircraft co while the b was assembled also by bell aircraft co and by glenn l martin company after the war most orders of bombers were canceled and  people lost their jobs at boeingcitation needed the company aimed to recover quickly by selling its stratocruiser the model  a luxurious fourengine commercial airliner developed from the b however sales of this model were not as expected and boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situationcitation needed the company successfully sold military derivatives of the stratocruiser such as the c adapted for troop transportation and the kc for aerial refuelingcitation needed sedit the boeing  in british overseas airways corporation boac livery  boeing developed military jets such as the b stratojet and b stratofortress bombers in the lates and into the s during the early s boeing used company funds to develop the – jet airliner demonstrator that led to the kc stratotanker and boeing  jetliner some of these were built at boeings facilities in wichita kansas which existed from  to  in the mids technology had advanced significantly which gave boeing the opportunity to develop and manufacture new products one of the first was the guided shortrange missile used to intercept enemy aircraft by that time the cold war had become a fact of life and boeing used its shortrange missile technology to develop and build an intercontinental missile in  boeing began delivery of its  the united states first commercial jet airliner in response to the british de havilland comet french sud aviation caravelle and soviet tupolev tu which were the worlds first generation of commercial jet aircraft with the  a fourengine passenger airliner the us became a leader in commercial jet manufacture a few years later boeing added a second version of this aircraft the boeing  which was slightly faster and had a shorter range boeing was a major producer of small turbine engines during the s and s the engines represented one of the companys major efforts to expand its product base beyond military aircraft after world war ii development on the gasoline turbine engine started in  and boeings gas turbines were designated models     and  boeing built  engines before production ceased in april  many applications of the boeing gas turbine engines were considered to be firsts including the first turbinepowered helicopter and boat sedit the  and  formed the backbone of many major airline fleets through the end of the s including united  shown and pan am  shown lufthansa boeing  a boeing  the bestselling aircraft vertol aircraft corporation was acquired by boeing in  and was reorganized as boeings vertol division the twinrotor ch chinook produced by vertol took its first flight in  this heavylift helicopter remains a workhorse vehicle up to the present day in  vertol also began

assembly facility in new orleans louisiana in  boeing president william m allen asked malcolm t stamper to spearhead production of the new  airliner on which the companys future was riding this was a monumental engineering and management challenge and included construction of the worlds biggest factory in which to build the  at everett washington a plant which is the size of  football fields in  boeing introduced another short and mediumrange airliner the twinengine  it has become since then the bestselling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history several versions have been developed mainly to increase seating capacity and range the  remains in production as of april  the rollout ceremonies for the first  took place in  at the massive new factory in everett about an hours drive from boeings seattle home the aircraft made its first flight a year later the first commercial flight occurred in  the  has an intercontinental range and a larger seating capacity than boeings previous aircraft boeing also developed hydrofoils in the s the screwdriven uss high point pch was an experimental submarine hunter the patrol hydrofoil uss tucumcari pgh was more successful only one was built but it saw service in vietnam and europe before running aground in  its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the example for the later pegasusclass patrol hydrofoils and the model  jetfoil ferries in the s the tucumcari and later boats were produced in renton while the navy hydrofoils were withdrawn from service in the late s the boeing jetfoils are still in service in asia sedit in the early s boeing suffered from the simultaneous decline in vietnam war military spending the slowing of the space program as project apollo neared completion the recession of – and the companys  billion debt as it built the new  airliner boeing did not receive any orders for more than a year its bet for the future the  was delayed in production by three months because of problems with its pratt  whitney engines another problem was that in  the us congress decided to stop funding for the development of the supersonic  boeings answer to the britishfrench concorde forcing the company to discontinue the project commercial airplane group by far the largest unit of boeing went from  employees in  to  in  each unemployed boeing employee cost at least one other job and unemployment rose to  percent the highest in the united statescitation needed housing vacancy rates rose to  percent from  percent in citation needed uhaul dealerships ran out of trailers because so many people moved out a billboard appeared near the airport– will the last person leaving seattle  turn out the lights in january  the first  a fourengine longrange airliner flew its first commercial flight with pan american world airways the  changed the airline industry providing much larger seating capacity than any other airliner in production the company has delivered over  boeing s the  has undergone continuous improvements to keep it technologically uptodate larger versions have also been developed by stretching the upper deck the newest version of the  the  is in production as of  boeing launched three jetfoil  hydrofoils that were acquired in  for service in the hawaiian islands when the service ended in  the three hydrofoils were acquired by far east hydrofoil for service between hong kong and macau during the s boeing also developed the us standard light rail vehicle which has been used in san francisco boston and morgantown west virginia sedit the narrow body boeing  replaced the  this example is in turkmenistan airlines livery the boeing  replaced the boeing  this example is in qantas livery in  the economic situation began to improve boeing assembled its th  passenger aircraft during the following years commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces as passenger air traffic increased competition was harder mainly from airbus a european newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing boeing had to offer new aircraft and developed the singleaisle  the larger twinaisle  and upgraded versions of the  an important project of these years was the space shuttle to which boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the apollo era boeing participated also with other products in the space program and was the first contractor for the international space station program during the decade several military projects went into production including boeing support of the stealth b bomber as part of an industry team led by northrop boeing built the outboard portion of the b stealth bomber wing the aft center fuselage section landing gear fuel system and weapons delivery system at its peak in  the b was the largest military program at boeing employing about  people the same year the national aeronautic association of the usa awarded the b design team the collier trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in america the first b rolled out of the bombers final assembly facility in palmdale california in november  and it flew for the first time on july   the avenger air defense system and a new generation of shortrange missiles also went into production during these years boeing was very active in upgrading existing military equipment and developing new ones boeing also contributed to wind power development with the experimental mod wind turbines for nasa and the united states department of energy and the modb for hawaii sedit air france er boeing was one of seven competing companies that bid for the advanced tactical fighter boeing agreed to team with general dynamics and lockheed so that all three companies would participate in the development if one of the three companies designs was selected the lockheed design was eventually selected and developed into the f raptor in april  boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time the twinengine  with a seating capacity of approximately  to  passengers in a typical threeclass layout in between the  and the  the longest range twinengined aircraft in the world the  was the first boeing airliner to feature a flybywire system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the european airbus into boeings traditional market this aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using computeraided design cad techniques the  was also the first airplane to be certified for  minute etops at entry into service by the faa also in the mids the company developed the revamped version of the  known as the  nextgeneration or ng it has since become the fastestselling version of the  in history and on april   sales passed those of the classic  with a followup order for  aircraft from southwest airlines in  boeing chose to demolish the headquarters complex on east marginal way south instead of upgrading it to match new seismic standards the headquarters were moved to an adjacent building and the facility was demolished in  in  boeing was headquartered on east marginal way south by king county airport in seattle in  boeing acquired rockwells aerospace and defense units the rockwell business units became a subsidiary of boeing named boeing north american inc in august  boeing merged with mcdonnell douglas in a us billion stock swap under the name the boeing company however this name had actually been boeings official name previously adopted on may   following the merger the mcdonnell douglas md was renamed the boeing  and the production of the md was limited to the freighter version boeing introduced a new corporate identity with completion of the merger incorporating the boeing logo type and a stylized version of the mcdonnell douglas symbol which was derived from the douglas aircraft logo from the s aerospace analyst scott hamilton heavily criticized the ceo and his deputy philip m condit and harry stonecipher for thinking of their personal benefit first and with it causing the problems hitting boeing many years later instead of investing the huge cash reserve to build new airplanes they initiated a program to buy back boeing stock for more than us billionimportance –edit international space station boeing everett factory in  in january  boeing chose to expand its

last civil aircraft to be designed by mcdonnell douglas would cease production in  the  was in danger of cancellation as well with the  replacing it but orders for the freighter version extended the program after several decades of success boeing lost ground to airbus and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in  multiple boeing projects were pursued and then canceled notably the sonic cruiser a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the speed of sound cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as  percent it was launched in  along with a new advertising campaign to promote the companys new motto forever new frontiers and to rehabilitate its image however the planes fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the september  attacks and the subsequent weak economy and increase in fuel prices subsequently boeing streamlined its production and turned its attention to a new model the boeing  dreamliner using much of the technology developed for the sonic cruiser but in a more conventional aircraft designed for maximum efficiency the company also launched new variants of its successful  and  models the  proved to be a highly popular choice with airlines and won a record number of prelaunch orders with delays to airbus a program several airlines threatened to switch their a orders to boeings new  version the  airbuss response to the  the a received a lukewarm response at first when it was announced as an improved version of the a and then gained significant orders when airbus promised an entirely new

tough choices about specific systems and defense priorities based solely on the national interest and then stick to those decisions over time hit boeing especially hard because of their heavy involvement with canceled air force projects unethical conductedit in may  the us air force announced it would lease  kc tankers to replace the oldest  of its kcs in november  responding to critics who argued that the lease was more expensive than an outright purchase the dod announced a revised lease of  aircraft and purchase of  in december  the pentagon announced the project was to be frozen while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers darleen druyun who began employment at boeing in january was begun the fallout of this resulted in the resignation of boeing ceo philip m condit and the termination of cfo michael m sears harry stonecipher former mcdonnell douglas ceo and boeing coo replaced condit on an interim basis druyun pleaded guilty to inflating the price of the contract to favor her future employer and to passing information on the competing airbus a mrtt bid in october  she received a jail sentence for corruption in march  the boeing board forced president and ceo harry stonecipher to resign boeing said an internal investigation revealed a consensual relationship between stonecipher and a female executive that was inconsistent with boeings code of conduct and would impair his ability to lead the company james a bell served as interim ceo in addition to his normal duties as boeings cfo until the appointment of jim mcnerney as the new chairman president and ceo on june   industrial espionageedit in june  lockheed martin sued boeing alleging that the company had resorted to industrial espionage in  to win the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv competition lockheed martin claimed that the former employee kenneth branch who went to work for mcdonnell douglas and boeing passed nearly  pages of proprietary documents to his new employers lockheed martin argued that these documents allowed boeing to win  of the  tendered military satellite launches in july  boeing was penalized with the pentagon stripping seven launches away from the company and awarding them to lockheed martin furthermore the company was forbidden to bid for rocket contracts for a twentymonth period which expired in march  in early september  it was reported that boeing was negotiating a settlement with the us department of justice in which it would pay up to  million to cover this and the darleen druyun scandal  euus agreement notesedit until the late s the us had a near monopoly in the large civil aircraft lca sector the airbus consortium created in  started competing effectively in the s at that stage the us became concerned about the european competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the european governments for the developments of the early models of the airbus family this became a major issue of contention as the european side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to us lca manufacturers through nasa and defense programs the eu and the us started bilateral negotiations for the limitation of government subsidies to the lca sector in the late s negotiations were concluded in  with the signing of the ecus agreement on trade in large civil aircraft which imposes disciplines on government support on both sides of the atlantic which are significantly stricter than the relevant world trade organization wto rules notably the agreement regulates in detail the forms and limits of government support prescribes transparency obligations and commits the parties to avoiding trade disputes subsidy disputesedit in  the eu and the us agreed to discuss a possible revision of the  euus agreement provided that this would cover all forms of subsidies including those used in the us and in particular the subsidies for the boeing  the first new aircraft to be launched by boeing for  years in october  the us began legal proceedings at the wto by requesting wto consultations on european launch investment to airbus the us also unilaterally withdrew from the  euus agreement the us claimed airbus had violated a  bilateral accord when it received what boeing deemed unfair subsidies from several european governments airbus responded by filing a separate complaint contesting that boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the us government moreover the eu also complained that the investment subsidies from japanese airlines violated the accord on january   boeing and airbus agreed that they would attempt to find a solution to the dispute outside of the wto however in june  boeing and the united states government reopened the trade dispute with the wto claiming that airbus had received illegal subsidies from european governments airbus has also responded to this claim against boeing reopening the dispute and also accusing boeing of receiving subsidies from the us government on september   the wto ruled that boeing had received billions of dollars in government subsidies boeing responded by stating that the ruling was a fraction of the size of the ruling against airbus and that it required few changes in its operations boeing has received  billion in support from washington state future conceptsedit in may  four concept designs being examined by boeing were outlined in the seattle times based on corporate internal documents the research aims in two directions lowcost airplanes and environmentalfriendly planes codenamed after the wellknown muppets a design team known as the green team concentrated primarily on reducing fuel usage all four designs illustrated rearengine layouts fozzie employs open rotors and offers a lower cruising speed beaker has very thin long wings with the ability to partially foldup to facilitate easier taxiing kermit kruiser has forward swept wings over which are positioned its engines with the aim of lowering noise below due to the reflection of the exhaust signature upward honeydew with its delta wing design resembles a marriage of the flying wing concept and the traditional tube fuselage as with most concepts these designs are only in the exploratory stage intended to help boeing evaluate the potentials of such radical technologies boeing recently patented its own force field

the boeing model  at the museum of flight william e boeing in  in march  william e boeing bought heaths shipyard in seattle on the duwamish river which later became his first airplane factory boeing was incorporated in seattle by william boeing on july   as pacific aero products co boeing was later incorporated in delaware the original certificate of incorporation was filed with the secretary of state of delaware on july   boeing who studied at yale university worked initially in the timber industry where he became wealthy and learned about wooden structures this knowledge proved invaluable in his subsequent design and assembly of airplanes the company stayed in seattle to take advantage of the local supply of spruce wood william boeing founded his company a few months after the june  maiden flight of one of the two bw seaplanes built with the assistance of george conrad westervelt a us navy engineer boeing and westervelt decided to build the bw seaplane after having flown in a curtiss aircraft boeing bought a glenn martin flying birdcage seaplane so called because of all the guywires holding it together and was taught to fly by glenn martin himself boeing soon crashed the birdcage and when martin informed boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time he and his friend cdr gc westervelt agreed to build a better airplane and soon produced the bw seaplane this first boeing airplane was assembled in a lakeside hangar located on the northeast shore of seattles lake union many of boeings early planes were seaplanes on april   the us declared war on germany and later in the year entered world war i on may   the company became the boeing airplane company with the us entering the war boeing knew that the us navy needed seaplanes for training so boeing shipped two new model cs to pensacola florida where the planes were flown for the navy the navy liked the model c and ordered  more the company moved its operations to a larger former shipbuilding facility known as boeing plant  located on the lower duwamish river washington state boeings original logo when world war i ended in  a large surplus of cheap used military planes flooded the commercial airplane market preventing aircraft companies from selling any new airplanes driving many out of business others including boeing started selling other products boeing built dressers counters and furniture along with flatbottom boats called sea sleds in  the boeing b flying boat made its first flight it accommodated one pilot and two passengers and some mail over the course of eight years it made international airmail flights from seattle to victoria british columbia on may   the boeing model  made its first flight it was the first plane to fly over mount rainier in  boeing entered competition against curtiss to develop a pursuit fighter for the us army air service although curtiss finished its design first and was awarded the contract boeing continued to develop its pw fighter that plane along with the boeing p fb fighter made boeing a leading manufacturer of fighters over the course of the next decade in  boeing built its model  mail plane for the us government to use on airmail routes in  an improved version of this plane was built the model a which won the us post offices contract to deliver mail between san francisco and chicago the a also had a passenger cabin that accommodated two that same year boeing created an airline named boeing air transport which merged a year later with pacific air transport and the boeing airplane company the first airmail flight for the airline was on july   the company changed its name to united aircraft and transport corporation in  and acquired pratt  whitney hamilton standard propeller company and chance vought united aircraft then purchased national air transport in  on july   the passenger boeing  biplane made its first flight with three engines it was boeings first plane built with the sole intention of being a passenger transport an upgraded version the a carrying eighteen passengers made its first flight in september  s and sedit in  the monomail a lowwing monoplane that carried mail was built built entirely out of metal it was very fast and aerodynamic and had retractable landing gear in fact its design was so revolutionary that the engines and propellers of the time could not handle the plane by the time controllable pitch propellers were developed boeing was building its model  airliner two monomails were built the second one the model  had a passenger cabin in  the boeing  was introduced the first truly modern airliner the  was an allmetal lowwing monoplane that was much faster safer and easier to fly than other passenger aircraft for example it was the first twin engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine in an era of unreliable engines this vastly improved flight safety boeing built the first sixty aircraft exclusively for its own united airlines subsidiarys operations this badly hurt competing airlines and was typical of the anticompetitive corporate behavior that the us government sought to prohibit at the time the air mail act of  prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella so the company split into three smaller companies – boeing airplane company united airlines and united aircraft corporation the precursor to united technologies as a result william boeing sold off his shares and left boeing clairmont claire l egtvedt who had become boeings president in  became the chairman as well he believed the companys future was in building bigger planes work began in  on boeing plant  to accommodate the production of larger modern aircraft boeing b assembly line in wichita kansas  boeing  stratocruiser shortly after an agreement with pan american world airways pan am was reached to develop and build a commercial flying boat able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes the first flight of the boeing  clipper was in june  it was the largest civil aircraft of its time with a capacity of  passengers on day flights and of  passengers on night flights one year later the first regular passenger service from the us to the uk was inaugurated subsequently other routes were opened so that soon pan am flew with the boeing  to destinations all over the world in  boeing completed work on its model  stratoliner this was the worlds first pressurizedcabin transport aircraft and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of  feet  m – above most weather disturbances it was based on the b using the same wings tail and engines during world war ii boeing built a large number of b and b bombers boeing ranked twelfth among united states corporations in the value of wartime production contracts many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war in the beginning of march  production had been scaled up in such a manner that over  planes were built each month to prevent an attack from the air the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items during these years of war the leading aircraft companies of the us cooperated the boeingdesigned b bomber was assembled also by lockheed aircraft corp and douglas aircraft co while the b was assembled also by bell aircraft co and by glenn l martin company after the war most orders of bombers were canceled and  people lost their jobs at boeingcitation needed the company aimed to recover quickly by selling its stratocruiser the model  a luxurious fourengine commercial airliner developed from the b however sales of this model were not as expected and boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situationcitation needed the company successfully sold military derivatives of the stratocruiser such as the c adapted for troop transportation and the kc for aerial refuelingcitation needed sedit the boeing  in british overseas airways corporation boac livery  boeing developed military jets such as the b stratojet and b stratofortress bombers in the lates and into the s during the early s boeing used company funds to develop the – jet airliner demonstrator that led to the kc stratotanker and boeing  jetliner some of these were built at boeings facilities in wichita kansas which existed from  to  in the mids technology had advanced significantly which gave boeing the opportunity to develop and manufacture new products one of the first was the guided shortrange missile used to intercept enemy aircraft by that time the cold war had become a fact of life and boeing used its shortrange missile technology to develop and build an intercontinental missile in  boeing began delivery of its  the united states first commercial jet airliner in response to the british de havilland comet french sud aviation caravelle and soviet tupolev tu which were the worlds first generation of commercial jet aircraft with the  a fourengine passenger airliner the us became a leader in commercial jet manufacture a few years later boeing added a second version of this aircraft the boeing  which was slightly faster and had a shorter range boeing was a major producer of small turbine engines during the s and s the engines represented one of the companys major efforts to expand its product base beyond military aircraft after world war ii development on the gasoline turbine engine started in  and boeings gas turbines were designated models     and  boeing built  engines before production ceased in april  many applications of the boeing gas turbine engines were considered to be firsts including the first turbinepowered helicopter and boat sedit the  and  formed the backbone of many major airline fleets through the end of the s including united  shown and pan am  shown lufthansa boeing  a boeing  the bestselling aircraft vertol aircraft corporation was acquired by boeing in  and was reorganized as boeings vertol division the twinrotor ch chinook produced by vertol took its first flight in  this heavylift helicopter remains a workhorse vehicle up to the present day in  vertol also began production of the ch sea knight in december  boeing announced the model  jetliner which went into commercial service about three years later different passenger freight and convertible freighter variants were developed for the  the  was the first commercial jetliner to reach  sales boeing won a contract in  to manufacture the sic stage of the saturn v rocket manufactured at the michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana in  boeing president william m allen asked malcolm t stamper to spearhead production of the new  airliner on which the companys future was riding this was a monumental engineering and management challenge and included construction of the worlds biggest factory in which to build the  at everett washington a plant which is the size of  football fields in  boeing introduced another short and mediumrange airliner the twinengine  it has become since then the bestselling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history several versions have been developed mainly to increase seating capacity and range the  remains in production as of april  the rollout ceremonies for the first  took place in  at the massive new factory in everett about an hours drive from boeings seattle home the aircraft made its first flight a year later the first commercial flight occurred in  the  has an intercontinental range and a larger seating capacity than boeings previous aircraft boeing also developed hydrofoils in the s the screwdriven uss high point pch was an experimental submarine hunter the patrol hydrofoil uss tucumcari pgh was more successful only one was built but it saw service in vietnam and europe before running aground in  its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the example for the later pegasusclass patrol hydrofoils and the model  jetfoil ferries in the s the tucumcari and later boats were produced in renton while the navy hydrofoils were withdrawn from service in the late s the boeing jetfoils are still in service in asia sedit in the early s boeing suffered from the simultaneous decline in vietnam war military spending the slowing of the space program as project apollo neared completion the recession of – and the companys  billion debt as it built the new  airliner boeing did not receive any orders for more than a year its bet for the future the  was delayed in production by three months because of problems with its pratt  whitney engines another problem was that in  the us congress decided to stop funding for the development of the supersonic  boeings answer to the britishfrench concorde forcing the company to discontinue the project commercial airplane group by far the largest unit of boeing went from  employees in  to  in  each unemployed boeing employee cost at least one other job and unemployment rose to  percent the highest in the united statescitation needed housing vacancy rates rose to  percent from  percent in citation needed uhaul dealerships ran out of trailers because so many people moved out a billboard appeared near the airport– will the last person leaving seattle  turn out the lights in january  the first  a fourengine longrange airliner flew its first commercial flight with pan american world airways the  changed the airline industry providing much larger seating capacity than any other airliner in production the company has delivered over  boeing s the  has undergone continuous improvements to keep it technologically uptodate larger versions have also been developed by stretching the upper deck the newest version of the  the  is in production as of  boeing launched three jetfoil  hydrofoils that were acquired in  for service in the hawaiian islands when the service ended in  the three hydrofoils were acquired by far east hydrofoil for service between hong kong and macau during the s boeing also developed the us standard light rail vehicle which has been used in san francisco boston and morgantown west virginia sedit the narrow body boeing  replaced the  this example is in turkmenistan airlines livery the boeing  replaced the boeing  this example is in qantas livery in  the economic situation began to improve boeing assembled its th  passenger aircraft during the following years commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces as passenger air traffic increased competition was harder mainly from airbus a european newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing boeing had to offer new aircraft and developed the singleaisle  the larger twinaisle  and upgraded versions of the  an important project of these years was the space shuttle to which boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the apollo era boeing participated also with other products in the space program and was the first contractor for the international space station program during the decade several military projects went into production including boeing support of the stealth b bomber as part of an industry team led by northrop boeing built the outboard portion of the b stealth bomber wing the aft center fuselage section landing gear fuel system and weapons delivery system at its peak in  the b was the largest military program at boeing employing about  people the same year the national aeronautic association of the usa awarded the b design team the collier trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in america the first b rolled out of the bombers final assembly facility in palmdale california in november  and it flew for the first time on july   the avenger air defense system and a new generation of shortrange missiles also went into production during these years boeing was very active in upgrading existing military equipment and developing new ones boeing also contributed to wind power development with the experimental mod wind turbines for nasa and the united states department of energy and the modb for hawaii sedit air france er boeing was one of seven competing companies that bid for the advanced tactical fighter boeing agreed to team with general dynamics and lockheed so that all three companies would participate in the development if one of the three companies designs was selected the lockheed design was eventually selected and developed into the f raptor in april  boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time the twinengine  with a seating capacity of approximately  to  passengers in a typical threeclass layout in between the  and the  the longest range twinengined aircraft in the world the  was the first boeing airliner to feature a flybywire system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the european airbus into boeings traditional market this aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using computeraided design cad techniques the  was also the first airplane to be certified for  minute etops at entry into service by the faa also in the mids the company developed the revamped version of the  known as the  nextgeneration or ng it has since become the fastestselling version of the  in history and on april   sales passed those of the classic  with a followup order for  aircraft from southwest airlines in  boeing chose to demolish the headquarters complex on east marginal way south instead of upgrading it to match new seismic standards the headquarters were moved to an adjacent building and the facility was demolished in  in  boeing was headquartered on east marginal way south by king county airport in seattle in  boeing acquired rockwells aerospace and defense units the rockwell business units became a subsidiary of boeing named boeing north american inc in august  boeing merged with mcdonnell douglas in a us billion stock swap under the name the boeing company however this name had actually been boeings official name previously adopted on may   following the merger the mcdonnell douglas md was renamed the boeing  and the production of the md was limited to the freighter version boeing introduced a new corporate identity with completion of the merger incorporating the boeing logo type and a stylized version of the mcdonnell douglas symbol which was derived from the douglas aircraft logo from the s aerospace analyst scott hamilton heavily criticized the ceo and his deputy philip m condit and harry stonecipher for thinking of their personal benefit first and with it causing the problems hitting boeing many years later instead of investing the huge cash reserve to build new airplanes they initiated a program to buy back boeing stock for more than us billionimportance –edit international space station boeing everett factory in  in january  boeing chose to expand its presence in another aerospace field of satellite communications by purchasing hughes electronics hughes space and communications company which had pioneered the satellite communications field in september  boeing moved its corporate headquarters from seattle to chicago chicago dallas and denver – vying to become the new home of the worlds largest aerospace concern – all had offered packages of multimilliondollar tax breaks its offices are located in the fulton river district just outside the loop chicago on october   boeing lost to its rival lockheed martin in the fierce competition for the multibilliondollar joint strike fighter contract boeings entry the x was rejected in favor of lockheeds x entrant boeing continues to serve as the prime contractor on the international space station and has built several of the major components boeing began development of the kc aerial refueling tanker in the early s italy and japan ordered four kcs each after development delays and faa certification boeing delivered the tankers to japan from  with the second kc following on march  to  italy received its four kc during  in  boeing ended production of the  after  aircraft were produced more advanced stretched versions of the  were beginning to compete against the  and the planned  was to fill much of the top end of the  market also that year boeing announced that the  the last civil aircraft to be designed by mcdonnell douglas would cease production in  the  was in danger of cancellation as well with the  replacing it but orders for the freighter version extended the program after several decades of success boeing lost ground to airbus and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in  multiple boeing projects were pursued and then canceled notably the sonic cruiser a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the speed of sound cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as  percent it was launched in  along with a new advertising campaign to promote the companys new motto forever new frontiers and to rehabilitate its image however the planes fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the september  attacks and the subsequent weak economy and increase in fuel prices subsequently boeing streamlined its production and turned its attention to a new model the boeing  dreamliner using much of the technology developed for the sonic cruiser but in a more conventional aircraft designed for maximum efficiency the company also launched new variants of its successful  and  models the  proved to be a highly popular choice with airlines and won a record number of prelaunch orders with delays to airbus a program several airlines threatened to switch their a orders to boeings new  version the  airbuss response to the  the a received a lukewarm response at first when it was announced as an improved version of the a and then gained significant orders when airbus promised an entirely new design the  program has encountered delays with the first flight not occurring until late  after regulatory approval boeing formed a joint venture united launch alliance with its competitor lockheed martin on december   the new venture is the largest provider of rocket launch services to the us government on august   boeing sold its rocketdyne rocket engine division to pratt  whitney on may   boeing agreed to purchase dallas texasbased aviall inc for  billion and retain  million in debt aviall inc and its subsidiaries aviall services inc and ils formed a wholly owned subsidiary of boeing commercial aviation services bcas realizing that increasing numbers of passengers have become reliant on their computers to stay in touch boeing introduced connexion by boeing a satellite based internet connectivity service that promised air travelers unprecedented access to the world wide web the company debuted the product to journalists in  receiving generally favorable reviews however facing competition from cheaper options such as cellular networks it proved too difficult to sell to most airlines in august  after a short and unsuccessful search for a buyer for the business boeing chose to discontinue the service on august   nasa selected boeing as the manufacturing contractor for the liquidfueled upper stage of the ares i rocket the stage based on both apollosaturn and space

while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers darleen druyun who began employment at boeing in january was begun the fallout of this resulted in the resignation of boeing ceo philip m condit and the termination of cfo michael m sears harry stonecipher former mcdonnell douglas ceo and boeing coo replaced condit on an interim basis druyun pleaded guilty to inflating the price of the contract to favor her future employer and to passing information on the competing airbus a mrtt bid in october  she received a jail sentence for corruption in march  the boeing board forced president and ceo harry stonecipher to resign boeing said an internal investigation revealed a consensual relationship between stonecipher and a female executive that was inconsistent with boeings code of conduct and would impair his ability to lead the company james a bell served as interim ceo in addition to his normal duties as boeings cfo until the appointment of jim mcnerney as the new chairman president and ceo on june   industrial espionageedit in june  lockheed martin sued boeing alleging that the company had resorted to industrial espionage in  to win the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv competition lockheed martin claimed that the former employee kenneth branch who went to work for mcdonnell douglas and boeing passed nearly  pages of proprietary documents to his new employers lockheed martin argued that these documents allowed boeing to win  of the  tendered military satellite launches in july  boeing was penalized with the pentagon stripping seven launches away from the company and awarding them to lockheed martin furthermore the company was forbidden to bid for rocket contracts for a twentymonth period which expired in march  in early september  it was reported that boeing was negotiating a settlement with the us department of justice in which it would pay up to  million to cover this and the darleen druyun scandal  euus agreement notesedit until the late s the us had a near monopoly in the large civil aircraft lca sector the airbus consortium created in  started competing effectively in the s at that stage the us became concerned about the european competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the european governments for the developments of the early models of the airbus family this became a major issue of contention as the european side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to us lca manufacturers through nasa and defense programs the eu and the us started bilateral negotiations for the limitation of government subsidies to the lca sector in the late s negotiations were concluded in  with the signing of the ecus agreement on trade in large civil aircraft which imposes disciplines on government support on both sides of the atlantic which are significantly stricter than the relevant world trade organization wto rules notably the agreement regulates in detail the forms and limits of government support prescribes transparency obligations and commits the parties to avoiding trade disputes subsidy disputesedit in  the eu and the us agreed to discuss a possible revision of the  euus agreement provided that this would cover all forms of subsidies including those used in the us and in particular the subsidies for the boeing  the first new aircraft to be launched by boeing for  years in october  the us began legal proceedings at the wto by requesting wto consultations on european launch investment to airbus the us also unilaterally withdrew from the  euus agreement the us claimed airbus had violated a  bilateral accord when it received what boeing deemed unfair subsidies from several european governments airbus responded by filing a separate complaint contesting that boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the us government moreover the eu also complained that the investment subsidies from japanese airlines violated the accord on january   boeing and airbus agreed that they would attempt to find a solution to the dispute outside of the wto however in june  boeing and the united states government reopened the trade dispute with the wto claiming that airbus had received illegal subsidies from european governments airbus has also responded to this claim against boeing reopening the dispute and also accusing boeing of receiving subsidies from the us government on september   the wto ruled that boeing had received billions of dollars in government subsidies boeing responded by stating that the ruling was a fraction of the size of the ruling against airbus and that it required few changes in its operations boeing has received  billion in support from washington state future conceptsedit in may  four concept designs

cruising speed beaker has very thin long wings with the ability to partially foldup to facilitate easier taxiing kermit kruiser has forward swept wings over which are positioned its engines with the aim of lowering noise below due to the reflection of the exhaust signature upward honeydew with its delta wing design resembles a marriage of the flying wing concept and the traditional tube fuselage as with most concepts these designs are only in the exploratory stage intended to help boeing evaluate the potentials of such radical technologies boeing recently patented its own force field
