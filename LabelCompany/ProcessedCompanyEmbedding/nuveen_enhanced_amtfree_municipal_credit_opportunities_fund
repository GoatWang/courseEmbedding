securities will decline in value if market interest rates risecredit risk debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due  investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default  unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency however such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposesleverage risk the fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share nav market price and distributions  leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio whether that return is positive or negative leverage is intended to increase common share net income but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful  different forms of leverage including swaps may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limitsinverse floater risk the fund invests in inverse floaters due to their leveraged nature these derivative investments can greatly increase a fund’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk including counterparty credit risk in addition investments in inverse floaters involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investmenttax risk the

portion of its investments in lowquality bonds sometimes called “junk bonds” which have greater credit risk and generally are less liquid and have more volatile prices than higher quality securitieshedging risk the fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful  derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount investedmunicipal bond market liquidity risk inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years either due to brokerdealer choices or to federal banking regulations reducing their ability to make a market in these securities this may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs particularly during periods of economic or market stress as a result the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired to sell other securities to raise cash or to give up an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on performance large block sales could further

portfolio manager of the robinson tax advantaged income robax a mutual fund made up of closedend muni funds is a fan of the two remaining nuveen funds they should benefit from better trading efficiency scale and the current discounts should narrow over time he says nuveen dividend advantage municipal income fund nvg and nuveen dividend advantage municipal fund  nzf both have  discounts currently  wider than the current average discount for closedend municipal bond funds “mergers historically have been a sticky solution to a chronic discount problem” says robinson he isnt surprised it took a while to round up the necessary number of votes from the funds shareholder base of individual investors also the mergers tweak the characteristics of the acquiring funds a bit both have their investment mandates broadened to allow them to buy more lower rated bonds nvg also becomes entirely exempt from securities subject to the alternative minimum tax amt more details on the mergers are available in a qa on the nuveen website the mergers will also increase the total costs by a few basis points but not enough to outweigh the benefits says robinson to be folded into nzf which will
