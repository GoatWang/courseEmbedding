chun history  lineage robert yeung   history  lineage robert yeung     master robert yeung was born in kowloon in 9  his first martial arts experience began when he was 6 years old  the teenaged yeung joined a japanese judo school in kowloon  yeung found grappling to his liking and stayed with the school for four years rising to the rank of senior brown belt  master yeung recalled that there were not many kung fu schools around  the chinese kung fu schools that he visited lacked the discipline and the regimental training found in traditional japanese judo training  i recommend judo training for teenagers before they learn kung fu   master yeung joined the police auxiliary at the age of   he also attended drafting school while working parttime  master yeungs childhood friend shak chun wah stopped by one day to pass on the word about a system of kung fu named wing chun  the wing chun system was practical and useful in street situations typically found in hong kong  as both young men shared their knowledge robert yeung got his first experience with wing chun  shak moved swiftly inside yeungs arms delivered several punches shifted his stance and trapped one arm over the other arm with a downward pressing palm maneuver  the two friends talked at length about the unique arm trapping and leg jamming techniques within the wing chun system  shortly after this meeting shak took yeung to see master wong long  at the age of 4 robert yeung began training in wing chun kung fu under sigung wong long   learning quickly robert yeung became wong longs close assistant and sparring partner  robert yeung rigorously trained with wong long for just over four years  to expand his wing chun horizon of knowledge robert yeung sought instruction from wong chok  during the next two years wong chok imparted to robert yeung the two coveted wing chun weapons  wong chok also expanded yeungs knowledge of using wing chuns tactical footwork traps and jams to uproot and gain advantage over an opponent  yeung established himself as a skilled and aggressive fighter  his unyielding and forward charging ability earned him the wing chun name yeung biu  biu is a special chinese name for tiger   master wong chok took robert yeung to meet the now aged yip man  with wong choks introduction and recommendation yip man gave his approval for robert yeung to open his own school and teach students  robert yeung stayed in hong kong for another two years before meeting his wife and moving to hawaii usa in 9  he recalled the many hardships that he had to endure in a new country as an immigrant  despite the rough transition yeung officially opened his first wing chun school in hawaii in 9  as his following grew yeungs school moved from rex ravells gym in honolulu to the armed forces ymca  the armed forces ymca became the home of wing chun in hawaii for the next  years from 94 to 96 when the building was sold  master yeungs school relocated to the chinese cultural plaza chinatown in 9  today master yeungs wing chun kung fu school is still open  his wing chun school in hawaii is one of the oldest traditional schools operating outside of hong kong   master yeung has retired from work to spend more time at his chinatown wing chun school in honolulu  his two children a girl and a boy are now grown  master yeung enjoys teaching and plans to travel more during his retirement from work  he states that there are many promising young students in his school today  if they can diligently pursue their wing chun training they will become our next generation of wing chun teachers   during the past 4 years of master yeungs teaching in hawaii hundreds of wing chun practitioners have come through his program  dozens of master yeungs students have finished the mook jong wooden man techniques  of the many graduates of master yeung eleven have established their own schools while many others are teaching small groups around the united states and internationally  although master yeung never mentioned his success it can be said that he was one of the most successful wing chun teachers in the united states  this website is dedicated to master yeung his many graduates and his numerous followers master yeung passed away sepetember  9 he is very much missed copyright  44 wing chun kungfu associationorange county wing chun association ocwingchun all rights reserved microsoft
