investors for more information please contact joe boskovich jr at boskovichjroldwestimcom or chad cook at ccookoldwestimcom process  old west investment management llc investment philosophy old wests investment philosophy stems from ben grahams classic observation that investing is most intelligent when it is most businesslike that means that we dont view stocks or bonds as financial instruments that trade up or down instead we view them as equivalent to private ownership or creditor stakes in the underlying businesses simply we consider ourselves businesspeople who merely transact through publiclytraded securities in every investment we make we seek a large margin of safety in terms of price paid relative to business value received buying at a large discount to intrinsic business value not only offers a magnified prospective return but more importantly provides a buffer against all the things that can and often do go wrong our perspective is that if we focus on the downside the upside will take care of itself investment process a focus on people forms the core of old wests investment process as a first principle we believe that the soundest way to protect and grow our capital is by aligning ourselves with management teams who have high stock ownership and smart pay it is our contention that incentives matter deeply and that there is no surer way to understand the character and motivation of a management team than to study how they get paid in the five minutes that it takes us to look at stock ownership pay levels and the business metrics that drive incentive pay we are able to intelligently eliminate over  of the potential companies that would otherwise absorb much of our time and resources as a first principle we believe that the soundest way to protect and grow our capital is by aligning ourselves with management teams who have high stock ownership and smart pay before we dig into our company specific analysis we source and sort potential investments through several intuitive filters that also relate to people first we monitor every purchase or sale of stock by insiders every day if a ceo and several directors purchase millions of dollars of their own stock in the public markets it doesnt necessarily mean that its a good investment but it does mean that we should print out the proxy and annual report to see if we can see what they do second every quarter we will mine and reverse engineer the publiclyfiled holdings of those that we consider to be the worlds top investors once again the presence of successful investors or businesspeople doesnt mean that we too should automatically invest in any given company but it does make us want to investigate further using our own investment criteria to see if we can see what they do  if we find one idea per quarter in the two weeks of time that this takes the process has paid for itself third we seek out and talk to people  from ceos to salespeople both current and former  to better understand the dynamics in their particular industries  we also read industry periodicals and attend trade shows as a way to better understand potential investments  finally we will look at special situations such as companies with complicated accounting that masks their underlying value where we can understand why the company is structurally misunderstood and mispriced once we decide to dig into a company we focus our work on management analysis financial analysis industry analysis and qualitative analysis management analysis the cornerstone of any investment analysis rests on a thorough understanding of the character incentives and experience of the management team that will be in control of our capitalclick here for more financial analysis old west seeks to rigorously understand a company’s current and past financial condition as a way to ground our view about the underlying business and the returns we can expect as an owner of that businessclick here for more industry analysis industry analysis allows old west to contextualize our company specific work within the larger industrial ecosystem that it operates inclick here for more qualitative analysis through qualitative analysis old west aims to connect our financial work to real world economics and understandingclick here for more qualitative analysis through qualitative analysis old west aims to connect our financial work to real world economics and understanding  simply how does the firm make money  what value proposition do they fill and to whom what are the unit economics  for example if we are looking at a retailer we will begin by understanding the unit economics of an individual store  what does it cost to take out a lease build out the store fill it with inventory advertise staff it with employees and pay for the utilities  then what level of sales is sustainable for that individual store  using these figures we can calculate the cash on cash payback of opening a new store and the returns on capital of operating the store next perhaps the most critical question we ask ourselves is what makes this business sustainable  the business world is fiercely competitive and without the presence of identifiable and meaningful barriers to entry returns on capital above a company’s cost of capital should be expected to diminish over time  to illustrate let’s assume a company has invested capital of  and is projected to be able to earn year or a  return on capital  at x cash flow the market would place a value between  on that business  simply if an entrepreneur can recreate that business she will invest  in order to create that  of market value  as more entrepreneurs enter marginal returns should be driven down so that our company can instead earn closer to year or a  return on capital  what then makes a business sustainable  there are several types of barriers to entry that may permit a company to earn sustainably high rates of return on its capital regulatory such as a license holder like gtech network effect an exchange like ebay or brand power with scale coca cola to name a few  when we see a company earning attractive rates of return on its capital we relentlessly focus on how we could kill the business  if we had an unlimited amount of capital and time could we successfully enter into their business and markets  how could we steal customers and at what cost  after focusing on the business economics and their defensibility we aim to combine our work into a cohesive thesis  in doing so we will seek to answer two simple questions is the business misvalued  and more importantly why is it misvalued industry analysis industry analysis allows old west to contextualize our company specific work within the larger industrial ecosystem that it operates in  how is the ecosystem vertically and horizontally organized  what are the economic and financial characteristics of each segment of the ecosystem  for example what segments and which companies capture the best margins and returns on capital  how have those changed over time and what are the economic drivers  how is customer or supplier concentration changing what is the threat of technological substitution  how do competitors compete with each other  understanding the larger industrial ecosystem enlightens simple financial analysis with rigorous fieldwork and scuttlebutt  speaking with customers competitors and suppliers reading industry publications and attending industry conferences allow us to understand the fundamental industrial forces that will shape individual company performance  management analysis the cornerstone of any investment analysis rests on a thorough understanding of the character incentives and experience of the management team that will be in control of our capital andre meyer the late senior partner of lazard frères put it succinctly “business real business is not numbers and it’s not money it’s people you have to be able to know and judge people” old west’s goal is to invest alongside proven ownermanagers as silent partners when we buy shares in a business we are purchasing a stake in its current balance sheet and a claim on the future cash flows that balance sheet can generate the process by which that business value will grow is a direct function of management’s approach to capital allocation it is hard to overemphasize how important this is in the course of a decade an average business through reinvestment will replace nearly every asset it owns as the value of our investment will be the result of those future reinvestment decisions we will only invest with managers who we unequivocally trust and respect that said there is no single and quantifiable data source to vet such issues instead it requires a fluid and qualitative analysis that considers past actions and current incentives as a way to understand how management will make future decisions financial analysis old west seeks to rigorously understand a company’s current and past financial condition as a way to ground our view about the underlying business and the returns we can expect as an owner of that business  we begin with a company’s balance sheet to understand what they own and what they owe  generally we focus on profitable companies with little debt  once we know the amount of capital deployed in the business we then focus on determining what cash earnings that capital is able to produce after stripping out all expenditures necessary to maintain the business  in estimating the company’s cash generative ability we focus on the underlying bottomup drivers – garnered from our industry and qualitative work – to project what the company can earn in the present and the future  then crucially we connect the projected cash flows back to the capital that drives them by computing the company’s returns on capital what are the returns on assets equity and incremental capital  what have they been historically and does that mesh with what we are contemplating for the future  how does this compare to peers’ financial and capital characteristics  finally how would we think about valuing the underlying assets and associated cash flows under a range of industrial scenarios  commentaries  old west investment management llc view and download our latest commentaries wall street transcript interview with old west old west q
