bonds are not forever “public policy is to suppress interest rates and thereby transfer real wealth from savers to borrowers investors should respond by radically lowering their allocation to fixed

answer as the enormous build up in debt will depress the afterinflation returns for bondholders bonds are not forever links the debt buildup with the growth in financial services and concludes that while bonds have been a great investment for over  years their best days are behind them by considering history the fallout from the credit bubble and america’s political process the reader will learn

morgan kmi reported earnings last week including a long expected dividend hike and a pleasantly surprising stock buyback in many ways the stock performance and corporate finance moves of kmi reflect the master limited partnership mlp sector as a whole preshale revolution kinder morgan partners kmp had rewarded investors with steady distribution growth and modest for their size investments in new projects their investor presentation included a slide labelled “promises made promises kept” with a table showing these consistently higher payouts not all companies make old investor presentations available on their website – since it allows users to compare statements across years it can be embarrassing to kmi’s credit they do consequently we’re able to delve back several years and recall the world mlps used to inhabit this was a time of attractive stable distributions with modest growth and an occasional need for growth capital the shale revolution was not widely regarded as the energy sector game changer it became wealthy us investors tolerant of ks liked the mostly taxdeferred distributions mlps were an incomegenerating asset class kmp which was at the time the main operating entity noted that from  to  it had invested bn in new projects and acquisitions as was the norm most of that growth had been financed by issuing debt and equity since kmp paid out most of its distributable cash flow dcf in distributions over the next two and a half years as infrastructure demand grew they invested bn in growth projects  acquisitions for a total of bn over  years the chart below on the left includes b of organic capex budgeted for h to total b by ye by mid  kmi had concluded that the mlp investor base was too small to finance its growth the  presentation heralding the combination of kmi with kmp to create one integrated entity identified bn of organic growth projects over the next five years since  bn of the bn had been invested in greenfield  expansion projects with the balance being acquisitions so the bn five year projected figure was analogous to the bn from the prior  years since future acquisitions the other source of growth are generally very hard to forecast this is how the shale revolution manifested itself to big energy infrastructure companies there was suddenly the need for lots more investment in attractive assets to meet new flows of hydrocarbons but mlp investors weren’t big enough to provide the capital kmi concluded this as the yield on their kmp units edged up driven higher in order to attract the equity capital that their regular secondary offerings demanded the  kmikmp combination was intended to provide cheaper financing mlps exist because of the tax code owning pipelines or mlps for that matter see some mlp investors get taxed twice in a ccorp structure makes them taxable at the entity level whereas mlps largely don’t pay tax but the universe of eligible mlp investors is limited to us taxable k tolerant investors a small segment of all the global institutions who buy us equities as kmi found if you need billions every year mlp investors will start charging you more although folding kmp’s assets into kmi might have been expected to make them taxable kmi’s clever advisers structured the deal to not be taxable for many years see the tax story behind kinder morgan’s big transaction kmi could now fund its growth plans from the global equity market not just mlp investors their big mistake was to continue to think and act like an mlp so they still planned to pay out most of their free cash flow in dividends concurrently issuing new equity to get back most of it for growth but corporations on average pay out a third of their profits in dividends not  generating bn in dcf paying bn in dividends and raising bn in equity looks a bit odd albeit attractive to equity underwriters  so the market priced kmi accordingly driving up its yield as it rose above  the idea of handing cash earned from existing assets out and getting it back to invest in new assets looked increasingly absurd so they cut the distribution notice that all of these issues were corporate finance ones they all related to the liability side of kmi’s balance sheet it was all about how best to finance future assets the collapse in crude oil in  affected kmi only modestly because their cashflows are overwhelmingly from natural gas assets were mostly performing as expected but their missteps were a combination of financing strategy and amount of growth they certainly had the choice to cut their backlog of expansion projects which would have lowered their need for new financing but they chose as they did and the  dividend cut created enough cash to eliminate the need for external funding had they opted for less growth they would have been able to maintain their original payout the growth backlog is declining as some projects notably the bn north east direct project which was to improve natural gas distribution in new england were cancelled and others completed the excess cash is being used to reduce debt and starting in  will be returned through higher dividends and a buyback other big mlps merged their gp and mlp like kmi reduced growth plans or did both leverage rose because new assets are built and financed before they generate ebitda as those projects are put into service leverage is coming down price history will show that kmi and the mlp sector endured a terrible operating environment during the  crash in crude oil most investors even today regard the worst bear market in the sector’s history see the  mlp crash why and what’s next as an oilinduced fall in operating results the reality for kmi was that growth plans driven by the shale revolution exceeded the financing capacity of a specialized investor base this is pretty much the case for midstream in general it’s not obvious from a price chart but if you followed developments real time it’s the real story we are invested in kmi httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg   simon lack httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg simon lack  what kinder morgan tells us about mlps oil forecasters have to work harder july   commentsin mlps by simon lackthose in the oil industry who take a long view increasingly worry about insufficient new supply it’s hardly today’s problem with crude oil back to the mid s as opec’s production cuts are offset by increased shale output but depletion of existing fields is generally believed to take  million barrels a day mmbd off the market every year and demand continues to increase by  mmbd annually as a result mmbd of new supply is required annually to balance the market global production is currently around  mmbd last week amin nasser chairman of saudi aramco noted that the  mmbd of new production thus needed over the next five years is unlikely to be forthcoming from us shale or indeed anywhere else the international energy agency iea offered a similar outlook the shortcycle nature of shale is likely impeding new development in the past the supply response function of crude was quite slow in reacting to demand changes which contributed to some extreme price volatility since bottoming  months ago crude has been more stable the ability of shale producers to alter production in just a few weeks or months is contributing it also means that backers of a new conventional project have to consider the impact on their returns from a repeat of the  oil collapse since much of the us shale industry was able to protect itself by reducing output in the competition between shortcycle and longcycle the former’s flexibility represents a significant advantage it means some projects that might ultimately turn out to be profitable aren’t getting approved this is one of the reasons that jbc energy forecasts an extra mmbd of shale oil output by the end of next year this would take overall us crude output over  mmbd to around the same level as saudi arabia the us energy information administration eia agrees recently projecting  mmbd of average output next year which would correspond with jbc energy’s  mmbd  exit rate this will be the highest annual average production in us history surpassing the previous record of  mmbd set in  it’s worth noting that one year ago the eia was forecasting a decline of  mmbd to  mmbd for  production while they’re now projecting a  mmbd increase to  mmbd the size of the  mmbd revision over twelve months reflects the dramatic improvements in productivity across the industry and maybe ahem poor forecasting a recent example is devon energy’s record breaking well drilled in oklahoma which produced  barrels a day equivalent of oil and gas during its first  hours of operation us shale output is set to grow and is becoming the swing producer quickly responding to price signals and as a result keeping oil prices in a fairly narrow range prices may be lower than producers globally would like but they’re high enough to stimulate increased domestic production which is what the owners of midstream infrastructure care about impressive as these gains are they’re not going to meet the supply shortfall that saudi aramco’s nasser and others see on the horizon but it’s hard to see how that problem can be anything but good for the us and mlps httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg   simon lack httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg simon lack  oil forecasters have to work harder in the sweet spot of economics and public policy july   commentsin mlps by simon lackthe shift from natural gas importer to exporter has occurred in the us over a remarkably short period of time we’ve periodically written about this see us natural gas exports taking off and the global trade in natural gas only a few years ago cheniere energy lng was investing in facilities to import liquified natural gas lng anticipating that the us would need to rely on foreign suppliers such as australia and qatar the shale revolution changed all that and the conversion of planned regasification plants to liquefaction began the story of how this shift occurred is only complete when the role of cheniere’s founder charif souki is included greg zuckerman’s wonderfully absorbing  book the frackers paints colorful portraits of several key protagonists and souki is among them a lebanese immigrant to the us souki’s early career was with a small us investment bank where he raised  money for deals in the middle east relying initially on his father’s contacts in the region he was quite successful but eventually became tired of the deal making and travel for several years he and his family lived in aspen where he ran a restaurant the relaxed lifestyle was a welcome change and he enjoyed the regular visits of stars such as jack nicholson and michael douglas however the restaurant business wasn’t lucrative and eventually with his savings low he decided to shift directions again given this background charif souki was an unlikely energy pioneer however he applied his dealmaking skills to the energy business and eventually wound up running tiny ep company cheniere energy the best part of the coverage of souki in the frackers describes how he convinced other investors to back him in developing lng import facilities only to subsequently have to raise more capital to convert them for export it must have taken all his sales and dealmaking skills to follow up one compelling vision with another but he did having brought cheniere to the point at which it could start exports souki was forced out of the company by carl icahn souki’s substantial risk appetite had eventually paid off but by then his shareholders were looking for rather less excitement with bns in capital invested and contracts lasting  years the owners were looking for steady reliable progress to realizing promised returns charif souki was not that type of corporate leader i was reminded of all this the other day when perusing company presentations from a recent energy information administration eia conference this year us lng exports at times have exceeded imports driven in no small part by cheniere eia projections through  show the us quickly becoming a substantial exporter much of the shift to us exports is well known to those who follow the industry closely what’s less appreciated is how cheniere

week including a long expected dividend hike and a pleasantly surprising stock buyback in many ways the stock performance and corporate finance moves of kmi reflect the master limited partnership mlp sector as a whole preshale revolution kinder morgan partners kmp had rewarded investors with steady distribution growth and modest for their size investments in new projects their investor presentation included a slide labelled “promises made promises kept” with a table showing these consistently higher payouts not all companies make old investor presentations available on their website – since it allows users to compare statements across years it can be embarrassing to kmi’s credit they do consequently we’re able to delve back several years and recall the world mlps used to inhabit this was a time of attractive stable distributions with modest growth and an occasional need for growth capital the shale revolution was not widely regarded as the energy sector game changer it became wealthy us investors tolerant of ks liked the mostly taxdeferred distributions mlps were an incomegenerating asset class kmp which was at the time the main operating entity noted that from  to  it had invested bn in new projects and acquisitions as was the norm most of that growth had been financed by issuing debt and equity since kmp paid out most of its distributable cash flow dcf in distributions over the next two and a half years as infrastructure demand grew they invested bn in growth projects  acquisitions for a total of bn over  years the chart below on the left includes b of organic capex budgeted for h to total b by ye by mid  kmi had concluded that the mlp investor base was too small to finance its growth the  presentation heralding the combination of kmi with kmp to create one integrated entity identified bn of organic growth projects over the next five years since  bn of the bn had been invested in greenfield  expansion projects with the balance being acquisitions so the bn five year projected figure was analogous to the bn from the prior  years since future acquisitions the other source of growth are generally very hard to forecast this is how the shale revolution manifested itself to big energy infrastructure companies there was suddenly the need for lots more investment in attractive assets to meet new flows of hydrocarbons but mlp investors weren’t big enough to provide the capital kmi concluded this as the yield on their kmp units edged up driven higher in order to attract the equity capital that their regular secondary offerings demanded the  kmikmp combination was intended to provide cheaper financing mlps exist because of the tax code owning pipelines or mlps for that matter see some mlp investors get taxed twice in a ccorp structure makes them taxable at the entity level whereas mlps largely don’t pay tax but the universe of eligible mlp investors is limited to us taxable k tolerant investors a small segment of all the global institutions who buy us equities as kmi found if you need billions every year mlp investors will start charging you more although folding kmp’s assets into kmi might have been expected to make them taxable kmi’s clever advisers structured the deal to not be taxable for many years see the tax story behind kinder morgan’s big transaction kmi could now fund its growth plans from the global equity market not just mlp investors their big mistake was to continue to think and act like an mlp so they still planned to pay out most of their free cash flow in dividends concurrently issuing new equity to get back most of it for growth but corporations on average pay out a third of their profits in dividends not  generating bn in dcf paying bn in dividends and raising bn in equity looks a bit odd albeit attractive to equity underwriters  so the market priced kmi accordingly driving up its yield as it rose above  the idea of handing cash earned from existing assets out and getting it back to invest in new assets looked increasingly absurd so they cut the distribution notice that all of these issues were corporate finance ones they all related to the liability side of kmi’s balance sheet it was all about how best to finance future assets the collapse in crude oil in  affected kmi only modestly because their cashflows are overwhelmingly from natural gas assets were mostly performing as expected but their missteps were a combination of financing strategy and amount of growth they certainly had the choice to cut their backlog of expansion projects which would have lowered their need for new financing but they chose as they did and the  dividend cut created enough cash to eliminate the need for external funding had they opted for less growth they would have been able to maintain their original payout the growth backlog is declining as some projects notably the bn north east direct project which was to improve natural gas distribution in new england were cancelled and others completed the excess cash is being used to reduce debt and starting in  will be returned through higher dividends and a buyback other big mlps merged their gp and mlp like kmi reduced growth plans or did both leverage rose because new assets are built and financed before they generate ebitda as those projects are put into service leverage is coming down price history will show that kmi and the mlp sector endured a terrible operating environment during the  crash in crude oil most investors even today regard the worst bear market in the sector’s history see the  mlp crash why and what’s next as an oilinduced fall in operating results the reality for kmi was that growth plans driven by the shale revolution exceeded the financing capacity of a specialized investor base this is pretty much the case for midstream in general it’s not obvious from a price chart but if you followed developments real time it’s the real story we are invested in kmi httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg   simon lack httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg simon lack  what kinder morgan tells us about mlps oil forecasters have to work harder july   commentsin mlps by simon lackthose in the oil industry who take a long view increasingly worry about insufficient new supply it’s hardly today’s problem with crude oil back to the mid s as opec’s production cuts are offset by increased shale output but depletion of existing fields is generally believed to take  million barrels a day mmbd off the market every year and demand continues to increase by  mmbd annually as a result mmbd of new supply is required annually to balance the market global production is currently around  mmbd last week amin nasser chairman of saudi aramco noted that the  mmbd of new production thus needed over the next five years is unlikely to be forthcoming from us shale or indeed anywhere else the international energy agency iea offered a similar outlook the shortcycle nature of shale is likely impeding new development in the past the supply response function of crude was quite slow in reacting to demand changes which contributed to some extreme price volatility since bottoming  months ago crude has been more stable the ability of shale producers to alter production in just a few weeks or months is contributing it also means that backers of a new conventional project have to consider the impact on their returns from a repeat of the  oil collapse since much of the us shale industry was able to protect itself by reducing output in the competition between shortcycle and longcycle the former’s flexibility represents a significant advantage it means some projects that might ultimately turn out to be profitable aren’t getting approved this is one of the reasons that jbc energy forecasts an extra mmbd of shale oil output by the end of next year this would take overall us crude output over  mmbd to around the same level as saudi arabia the us energy information administration eia agrees recently projecting  mmbd of average output next year which would correspond with jbc energy’s  mmbd  exit rate this will be the highest annual average production in us history surpassing the previous record of  mmbd set in  it’s worth noting that one year ago the eia was forecasting a decline of  mmbd to  mmbd for  production while they’re now projecting a  mmbd increase to  mmbd the size of the  mmbd revision over twelve months reflects the dramatic improvements in productivity across the industry and maybe ahem poor forecasting a recent example is devon energy’s record breaking well drilled in oklahoma which produced  barrels a day equivalent of oil and gas during its first  hours of operation us shale output is set to grow and is becoming the swing producer quickly responding to price signals and as a result keeping oil prices in a fairly narrow range prices may be lower than producers globally would like but they’re high enough to stimulate increased domestic production which is what the owners of midstream infrastructure care about impressive as these gains are they’re not going to meet the supply shortfall that saudi aramco’s nasser and others see on the horizon but it’s hard to see how that problem can be anything but good for the us and mlps httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg

from natural gas importer to exporter has occurred in the us over a remarkably short period of time we’ve periodically written about this see us natural gas exports taking off and the global trade in natural gas only a few years ago cheniere energy lng was investing in facilities to import liquified natural gas lng anticipating that the us would need to rely on foreign suppliers such as australia and qatar the shale revolution changed all that and the conversion of planned regasification plants to liquefaction began the story of how this shift occurred is only complete when the role of cheniere’s founder charif souki is included greg zuckerman’s wonderfully absorbing  book the frackers paints colorful portraits of several key protagonists and souki is among them a lebanese immigrant to the us souki’s early career was with a small us investment bank where he raised  money for deals in the middle east relying initially on his father’s contacts in the region he was quite successful but eventually became tired of the deal making and travel for several years he and his family lived in aspen where he ran a restaurant the relaxed lifestyle was a welcome change and he enjoyed the regular visits of stars such as jack nicholson and michael douglas however the restaurant business wasn’t lucrative and eventually with his savings low he decided to shift directions again given this background charif souki was an unlikely energy pioneer however he applied his dealmaking skills to the energy business and eventually wound up running tiny ep company cheniere energy the best part of the coverage of souki in the frackers describes how he convinced other investors to back him in developing lng import facilities only to subsequently have to raise more capital to convert them for export it must have taken all his sales and dealmaking skills to follow up one compelling vision with another but he did having brought cheniere to the point at which it could start exports souki was forced out of the company by carl icahn souki’s substantial risk appetite had eventually paid off but by then his shareholders were looking for rather less excitement with bns in capital invested and contracts lasting  years the owners were looking for steady reliable progress to realizing promised returns charif souki was not that type of corporate leader i was reminded of all this the other day when perusing company presentations from a recent energy information administration eia conference this year us lng exports at times have exceeded imports driven in no small part by cheniere eia projections through  show the us quickly becoming a substantial exporter much of the shift to us exports is well known to those who follow the industry closely what’s less appreciated is how cheniere is aligning itself with federal policy the president clearly likes to promote america when he travels and be associated with deals on his recent trip to poland he was pushing lng exports there’s no

that’s producing  mmbd  furthermore the fact that us shale producers are growing production at ever lower costs is more likely bad for the other  of global producers the market is failing to differentiate us midstream energy companies that benefit from this growth in market share from the rest of the global energy losers  at the annual mlpa conference in orlando a few weeks ago mlp managements were similarly puzzled by the weakness in their stock prices but they were far less worried than most investors because they generally don’t need to tap the capital markets much to finance their growth plans it’s hard to find research that is bearish on mlps which is not especially comforting from a contrarian standpoint the most negative case is probably the view that crude is going to  and will take mlps lower with it before ascribing some additional insight to sellers remember that over bn of retail money accesses the asset class inefficiently via taxable ccorp funds such as amlp see some mlp investors get taxed twice our investors selfselected as they are are an intelligent bunch but they you are not representative of an investor base that includes those who accept a  corporate tax drag on their returns investment insight is going to be rare among this subset and based on published fund flows they are responsible for some portion of the recent selling for those who enjoy analyzing statistical qualities of returns the chart below compares the correlation of mlps with crude oil and subsequent performance it turns out that following periods of high mlpcrude correlation mlps do rather well the  day correlation is  so the  day correlation used in the chart below is most assuredly heading higher over the next few weeks a high  day correlation is typically followed by a good  day return the correlation of this relationship is  it’s been said that if you torture the data enough it’ll tell you whatever you like and some may believe that’s what’s going on here on the other hand mlps and crude oil shouldn’t move together nearly as much as they do so when they dance too closely perhaps nervous sellers create an opportunity in researching the components of the alerian mlp index we calculate that only  of the cashflows are derived from crude oil some large mlps have very little crude exposure including enterprise products epd at  and williams partners wpz with  others such as oneok partners oks and eqt midstream eqmp have  and this is the percentage of their cashflows derived from volumes of crude passing through their systems which are only loosely affected by the price of crude natural gas liquids mostly ethane propane butane isobutane and pentane are most commonly separated from the natural gas methane with which they’re extracted ngl prices tend to move with crude oil but together these still represent less than half the cashflows of the alerian index as with crude volumes are the principal driver of nglrelated cashflows with their prices being of secondary importance nonetheless mlp prices move with crude oil reinforcing the understandable fixation mlp investors have with oil even though it’s hard to justify based on underlying fundamentals in our fund we have an overweight to crude oiloriented infrastructure businesses but we estimate this at around  so  higher than the index on another topic last week we fielded a few questions from holders of rice midstream partners rmp eqt recently acquired rmp’s general partner gp rice energy rice rmp slumped because it highlighted a theme of our investing which is that you don’t need to own an mlp to control it owning the gp is sufficient rmp investors have few rights and the supply of accretive dropdowns they were expecting from their gp will now be redirected to eqm a loss of future value over which rmp investors have little recourse it’s why we invest in gps see mlps and hedge funds are more alike than you think we are invested in epd eqgp gp of eqm oneok oke gp of oks and williams companies wmb gp of wpz httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg   simon lack httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg simon lack  mlps this time is different mlps and hedge funds are more alike than you think june   commentsin mlps by simon lackit usually pays to invest with management in the hedge fund industry that has rarely been possible although most hedge fund managers invest in the fund they run their wealth has come from owning the hedge fund general partner gp which manages the fund opportunities to invest in hedge fund gps are rare they don’t need your capital and have little desire to share the lucrative economics in  i wrote the hedge fund mirage the illusion of big money and why it’s too good to be true the book pointed out what most hedge fund managers know – that hedge funds have been a great business and a lousy investment fees have eaten up virtually all the investment profits money still flows to hedge funds because there are and always will be some good ones but the farther you stray from a unique specialized strategy the more prosaic your returns the book drew some nice reviews and provoked few critics because most industry insiders preferred to minimize awareness of the lopsided split of investment returns being controversial turned out to be great fun and caused us to think differently about another asset class master limited partnerships mlps look like hedge funds although they own actual infrastructure assets rather than stocks bonds and currencies they share their organization as partnerships with hedge funds and private equity mlp investors like private equity pe fund investors have limited rights they’re called “limiteds” because limited partners lps have little recourse once they’re invested see the limited rights of some mlp investors not all mlps have a gp but many do and given how well hedge fund managers have done it’s no surprise that the people who run mlps prefer to invest in the gp the issue doesn’t receive much attention but research we’ve done shows that in a select group of mlps ie those we care about management has x as much money invested in gps versus lps hedge funds and pe funds classically pay their gp “  ” this  management fee and  of the profits means for example that an  return after fees required a  return before fees the  difference goes to the manager mlps pay their gps incentive distribution rights idrs which direct a portion of the mlp’s distributable cash flow dcf to the gp the dcf split typically starts low but goes up to  so the gp’s share can tend towards half the power of this becomes clear when you consider the financing of a new pipeline gps direct their mlps to do something the same way a pe manager directs his pe fund a new pipeline is designed planned built and operated by an mlp on instructions from its gp who then receives his share of the additional dcf created asset growth for pe managers is invariably beneficial and it’s generally true as well for mlp gps the best time to own hedge fund pe or mlp gps is during periods of asset growth the shale revolution see america is great with its growing output of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas is driving the need for more infrastructure assets recognition of this is behind the x statistic noted above it’s not a perfect analogy for example hedge fund investors have in aggregate done rather poorly whereas  year mlp returns of  are better than reits utilities and bonds since mlp’s generally only raise equity from taxable us investors tolerant of a k they are limited to this relatively small portion of the global equity market those mlps whose growth plans required several bn have given up the lucrative gpmlp structure in favor of being conventional corporations but as the x table shows a decent number find the mlp structure still works at the mlpa conference in orlando a few weeks ago questions usually concerned near term fluctuations in demand for one asset or another we think the big trade here is america’s path to energy independence and owning gps that benefit from continued infrastructure development conference chatter as well as attractive valuations show that it’s not yet a crowded trade   httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg   simon lack httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg simon lack  mlps and hedge funds are more alike than you think same data different conclusion june   commentsin mlps by simon lackwe’re not the first mlp investors to be puzzled by sector weakness in the face of growing oil and gas production this was visible most clearly on wednesday when a sharp drop in crude following inventory numbers caused similar drops in many mlps crude prices are weak precisely because of the success of technology in lowering costs most obviously in the permian in west texas where most of the growth in output is occurring higher than expected us production is mitigating the impact of opec’s production cuts this ought to be bad for producers of conventional crude oil elsewhere in the world and good for the owners of us energy infrastructure handling greater volumes so far that hasn’t been the case moreover permianexposed exploration and production ep companies are faring better than the mlps that service them this year mlps with permian exposure have lagged the alerian index with rising output depressing prices one might conclude that investors regard any increased utilization of infrastructure assets as temporary low crude will eventually feed through to reduced production and commensurately less need for pipeline and storage capacity at odds with this view the us energy information administration recently raised its q forecast of output to  million barrels a day mmbd up from their mmbd forecast of only four months earlier mlp investors may not believe this will happen and yet within the  ep sector those ep companies with significant exposure to the permian are outperforming the ep index pioneer resources pxd is outperforming all three mlps we’ve highlighted while plains gp holdings pagp is underperforming all but one of the ep names it seems that mlp investors and ep investors are drawing sharply different conclusions from the same set of data on oil production or more precisely potential mlp investors are declining to commit capital because they assess the outlook differently from ep investors at some point these views will have to reconcile which we expect will result in higher mlp prices there’s a similar divergence with bonds since the low in the energy sector on february th last year the high yield ep sector and mlps have roughly kept pace with one another over the last few months they have diverged with mlps underperforming since ep companies are generally mlp customers it’s odd for the prospects of the customers to be improving without a positive knockon effect for mlps but for now that is what’s happening the same data on output is supporting different conclusions by various investor types   httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg   simon lack httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg simon lack  same data different conclusion the  mlpa conference june   commentin mlps by simon lacklast week was the annual mlpa conference in orlando florida it’s safe to say the guests at nearby walt disney world had a more carefree time than beleaguered mlp investors one longtime attendee described the mood as “glum” noting that energy sector investors had expected a more vigorous rebound although the conference is organized around presentations by management teams in the hyatt regency’s cavernous ballrooms the private meetings that take place on the periphery are far more valuable it’s also nice to catch up with some familiar faces we had a full schedule of meetings with management teams usually with just one or two other investors in attendance the most pressing question for mlp investors of late is if exploration and production ep  companies ie mlp customers are continuing to increase production of oil and gas why isn’t this good for mlp stock prices in fact the entire energy complex has had a terrible few months mlps are  ytd although the sector feels as if it’s been falling for months meanwhile the oil services etf oih is  us crude output is  mmbd million barrels per day and is widely expected to reach  mmbd next year by many observers including opec q earnings for ep names as well as for mlps recently were generally good with positive guidance the fundamentals remain encouraging  to paraphrase a typical question from a financial advisor invested in our mutual fund “if you’re so smart how come we’re losing money lately” when asked about recent stock price weakness mlp executives were similarly puzzled the good news is that they’re not spending much time worrying about it – following the  crash many steps were taken to reduce reliance on the fickle equity markets leverage is down and distribution coverage is up distributions have been held flat and in some cases cut in order to finance growth while growth projects have been screened for higher returns generally mlps don’t have a pressing need for capital while stock price weakness makes both management and investors poorer it’s not being met by a desperate rush for capital to complete projects and in some cases such as targa resources trgp equity capital even at lower prices was nonetheless attractive financing for their recently announced natural gas liquids pipeline from the permian basin to north texas in short management teams usually exuded excitement about greater utilization of their existing infrastructure and growth plans they dismissed the high recent correlation between mlps and crude oil as a temporary phenomenon and not reflective of improving midstream fundamentals for investors who rely on the market to confirm the wisdom of their recent decisions it’s a time for patience while america’s journey to energy independence sends ever more hydrocarbons through our pipelines processing units and storage facilities we enjoyed the discussion with tallgrass energy tep cfo gary brauchle we’ve followed tep for a while see tallgrass energy is the right kind of mlp four years ago their rockies express natural gas pipeline rex looked increasingly redundant as its westeast flow from the rocky mountains to ohio faced growing competition from the marcellus shale tep reversed the flow on the eastern end of this pipeline and is looking at making the entire line twoway apparently our meeting was the same day as a bearish report from an obscure research analyst but his criticisms must have lacked substance since nobody raised the subject the mlp investor base has changed in recent years preshale it was an income generating asset class with modest growth the shale revolution created a substantially greater need for capital to fund growth such that during  mlps were raising more in equity than they were paying out in distributions see the  mlp crash why and what’s next the conversion of the investor base from income seeking to growth seeking was not smooth one ceo estimated  turnover in his shareholders over two years topics of discussion included the drop in attendance from last year although the convention facility is so big it rarely seems crowded there was some surprise at the pricing of antero midstream gp’s amgp recent ipo with a yield of  even with the  annual distribution growth forecast by one underwriter by  it would still yield just over  they may pull it off but sharing some of that execution risk with an eager set of ipo investors seems like a smart move those who had seen the presentation from the ipo roadshow chuckled at the inclusion of snapchat as a comparable because of its very high cashflow growth we thought that along with the pricing betrayed a fairly demeaning view of investors by management it seems most things need to go right for amgp and a stumble will expose the gulf in valuation between amgp and say plains all american pagp with its  distributable cash flow dcf yield if mlps were in a bubble amgp would be exhibit  except they’re not in chatting about energy transfer several investors remembered last year’s selfdealing transaction in which energy transfer equity ete issued preferential securities just to the management team see is energy transfer quietly fleecing its investors it’s still possible a delaware court could rule against ete and order the transaction be cancelled in many of the meetings managements were peppered with very granular questions about percentage utilization of a particular asset next quarter these generally came from sellside analysts looking to refine their models so as to forecast the next quarter’s earnings and dcf no doubt these are important topics but we feel such “forest for the trees” questions miss the big picture america is heading to energy independence and midstream infrastructure is vital to that goal in the near term it might seem important to try and forecast a quarterly fluctuation but it’s very hard to do so consistently far more importantly over the next few years what other asset class can possibly compete when america is headed towards being the world’s biggest crude oil producer see america is great last november opec lost and consequently our ep companies are gaining market share the shortcycle projects that are shale represent a completely different risk paradigm to conventional drilling with its inherent uncertainty over returns see why shale upends conventional thinking gathering and processing networks with their close exposure to the wellhead are more exposed to volume uncertainty in the short term but over the longer term they’ll be utilized these are the issues that will drive returns and while most investors are probably aware of the big picture their questions often betrayed a blinkered view mlp management teams hold substantially more money in gps compared with mlps when given the choice within the gpmlp structure what could be a more powerful statement about the upside they see than their personal investment in the vehicles with operating leverage the managements of energy transfer equity ete and tep are communicating their opinions with their commitments of personal capital see table at the end of the limited rights of some mlp investors in discussing their allocation to mlps i often ask investors what is the next most attractive sector of the equity markets beyond energy infrastructure with its huge tailwinds substantial future growth and  yields selling at  off its  alltime highs it doesn’t require much thought to buy what’s rising but not much else is cheap in summary valueseeking investors should draw comfort from the complete absence of irrational exuberance at this year’s mlpa conference today’s mlp investors are for the most part a patient bunch we are invested in ete pagp tegp the gp of tep and trgp httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg   simon lack httpwwwsladvisorscomwpcontentuploadslogojpg simon lack  the  mlpa conference plain talk on oil production may   commentsin mlps by simon lacklast wednesday plains all american pagp held their investor day these events typically afford investors the opportunity to get more detail on the company but plains also has a sophisticated macro view of the oil market as the biggest crude oil transportation company in america they naturally care a lot about north american output ceo greg armstrong invariably provides many great insights below are some selected slides from their presentation plains’ research focuses more on forecasting volumes rather than prices as befits an energy infrastructure operator the volumes of crude oil moved are more important than the value although there’s clearly a linkage because high prices stimulate output the first slide notes the sharp drop in upstream capex budgets which will eventually manifest itself through constrained supply the  drop in budgets is the biggest in thirty years there is little excess output capacity and notwithstanding recent weakness in oil prices over time the market will be increasingly vulnerable to a spike the second slide notes the impact of opec’s production cuts plains held their investor day a day before the opec meeting which extended the cuts through q note that the right hand chart assumes the  million barrelday mmbd opec cut is extended which should approximately absorb global inventories in excess of historic averages russia and other nonopec producers are expected to make up the balance of the mmbd contained in their announcement in short plains believes the market will balance as a result this slide on us inventories notes their currently high level compared with prior years but also that recent builds have been substantially lower than in the past during the qa session ceo armstrong referred to shale drilling as a manufacturing process a common analogy nowadays because the short cycle nature of shale projects see oil futures say shale’s here to stay results in fast return of capital with commensurately less risk much of this higher capital velocity is driven by improving efficiencies see extracting supply forecasts from oil futures one example of efficiencies is the use of multiwell pads this can sharply increase the production from each rig in use but comes with logistical challenges typically all the wells are drilled first then fracked this lengthens the time from initiation until production and increases the upfront capital investment it also results in more variable output as the bottom right illustration in the above slide shows with volumes coming in spurts the uneven output creates additional challenges for the exploration and production ep company as well as the supporting infrastructure today there is far greater certainty about the returns from a given level of investment than has traditionally been the case for the energy industry in fact armstrong noted that forecasting production relies heavily on knowing how much capital ep companies will commit which is itself dependent on expected returns the reasonably high visibility around output given capex informs the table below showing several decades of resource availability in a memorable quote greg armstromg said “the world may not need another million barrels a day of permian crude but it’s coming” lastly investors often ask whether there is excess infrastructure the answer is never simply yes or no new pipelines are typically built in anticipation of growing supply production ramps up steadily whereas a pipeline offers capacity only when it’s completed the result is when you plot pipeline capacity and supply of product you get a chart like this one the market seeks a narrow gap between the red line pipeline takeaway capacity plus refinery demand and the grey area production but capacity comes online in a step function while production moves more gradually too much capacity can hurt pipeline margins but insufficient capacity can leave ep companies scrambling for alternative transportation rail or truck both much more expensive the challenge for companies like plains is to build charts like this correctly and then plan their infrastructure investments accordingly it’s why they focus so carefully on the fundamentals driving their ep customers on a lighter note i can report that hydraulic fracturing “fracking” the process by which water is injected at high pressure into the porous rock holding hydrocarbons thereby creating millions of cracks and releasing it has found its way into popular culture brockmire a show available on amazon prime centers on a baseball announcer covering a minor league team in pennsylvania think marcellus shale called the frackers a local ep company sets its sights on the poorly attended frackers stadium for waste water disposal i won’t spoil the plot any further but discussion of fracking and shale are no longer limited to members of the energy sector our thanks to mlp
