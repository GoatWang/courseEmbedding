half of the month despite a number of major political events ranging from former fbi director james comey’s congressional testimony to general elections in the uk however market sentiment shifted at monthend after european central bank president mario draghi discussed the return of reflationary forces and the potential need to end quantitative easing measures later this year comments from the bank of england and bank of canada were also more hawkish than anticipated markets interpreted these statements as the first step towards a less accommodative monetary policy environment and the result was a sharp selloff in government bond markets accompanied by a drop in european stocks and a rally in the euro british pound and canadian dollar the fund made gains in fixed income relative value with net short exposure to bond duration and long exposure to credit spreads equity longshort was flat as equity market gains in the us and asia were offset by declines in europe global macro managers had a loss on the month due to bond and currency reversals the bulk of the month’s decline came from multistrategy and equity market neutral managers who were affected by the sharp sector

lower than  would normally indicate that a fund’s excess return is expected to be above the market’s excess return in a down year and below in an up year however beta cannot predict a fund’s future

steben  companys experience qualify them to manage the fund what is steben select multistrategy fund back to top steben select multistrategy fund “steben select” or the “fund” is a multimanager fund of hedge funds providing access to a select set of hedge fund managers it is built on steben’s year reputation of manager selection due diligence and monitoring a fund of hedge funds fohf is an investment product that pools investor assets together and invests in multiple hedge funds it is a closed end investment management company registered under the investment company act of  it is structured as a fund and is available to accredited investors only the fund is part of a masterfeeder structure and invests in a closedend nondiversified registered investment company the “master fund” the master fund in turn invests in unregistered hedge funds and registered investment companies “portfolio funds” there can be considerable differences between the fund and mutual funds although the fund is registered as an investment company both the fund and master fund have limited liquidity and do not provide daily net asset values what are the fund’s objectives back to top the fund’s investment objective is to seek capital appreciation with low longterm correlation to traditional public equity and fixed income markets the fund will pursue attractive riskadjusted returns while attempting to maintain a low correlation to managed futures and real estate investment trust reit markets manager selection will be driven by steben  company’s highly experienced research and risk management team using both quantitative and qualitative criteria diversification across multiple managers reducing single hedge fund exposure access to top hedge fund managers by pooling investor assets to reach investment minimums quarterly liquidity see  for more details centralized monthly performance and annual tax reporting  how is this fund different from a traditional hedge fund back to top investing in a single hedge fund as opposed to a fund of multiple hedge funds exposes the investor to “single manager risk” ie dependency on that individual manager’s ability to deliver returns while a fohf is not without significant risks it does diversify investor assets across multiple managers therefore reducing single manager risk steben select is not a hedge fund but invests in hedge funds it is a vehicle that offers investors access to hedge funds other differences can include lower investment minimum than going direct to an individual hedge fund pooling of investor assets allows access to managers with investment minimums out of reach of many investors opportunity for due diligence risk management manager selection and rebalancing what investment strategies does the fund pursue back to top initially the fund will pursue returns in  style areas of the hedge fund universe equity longshort quantitative equity market neutral global macro fixed income relative value for more detailed information on what these styles are we invite you to read our educational guide hedge funds an introduction how is this fund different from other similar funds in the marketplace back to top there are many different types of hedge fund investments available in the marketplace today they range from single hedge fund investments to funds of hedge funds to hedge fund replication strategies the particular types of vehicles include unregistered investment companies closedend registered investment companies mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs steben select fund is a fund of hedge funds funds of funds typically have more manager diversification than individual hedge funds they invest in multiple hedge funds whose managers seek to potentially generate profit through their skill in active portfolio management in contrast hedge fund replication strategies are typically rulesbased trading systems which attempt to mimic the risk profile of hedge fund indices and earn a return from the market risk premium associated with taking those risks by definition replication strategies have no “manager skill” and hence have no opportunity to earn excess profits above market risk premia through skillbased security selection or market timing which actual hedge fund managers attempt to do however replication strategies typically charge lower fees than hedge funds or fund of hedge funds steben select is a closedend investment management company registered under the investment company act of  registered funds of hedge funds are generally available only to accredited investors mutual funds and etfs are typically available to any investor mutual funds and etf structures have daily liquidity but this can limit the number of hedge fund strategies to only those which can be managed with daily liquidity it also constrains the universe of potential managers to those who are able or willing to accept daily redemptions from clients many hedge fund managers are unwilling to offer daily liquidity because of the disruption it causes to their trading strategies thus funds of hedge funds in an unregistered or closedend investment company format who may offer quarterly liquidity can access a much larger universe of hedge fund managers than mutual funds or etfs how many portfolio funds are in steben select back to top as of may  steben select currently invests with  managers a  goldman sachs hedge fund survey found that  of funds of hedge funds had over  managers so besides the low beta and correlation goals steben select fund invests in fewer hedge funds than the average fohf we believe that a smaller set of carefully selected managers can potentially better balance risk and return characteristics and that excessive manager diversification can dilute the pool of talent in the portfolio how is this fund different from a stock or bond investment back to top stocks and bonds are types of assets while hedge funds are a type of investing vehicle while a mutual fund can invest in stocks or bonds the same is true for a hedge fund hedge funds pool investor assets together and invest in a variety of assets including stocks and bonds the significant and important difference is that stock and bond mutual funds generally fall into the “longonly” investment category and most hedge funds fall into the alternative investment category most hedge funds are “unconstrained” and do not need to adhere to any benchmark simply stated they can attempt to pursue absolute returns seeking gains in both rising and falling markets through long and short positions a traditional stock or bond investment is reliant on the market rising including dividends and interest payments received to achieve profits likewise mutual funds pursuing returns in the equity and fixed income markets are typically “long only” meaning they tend to make money when the market rises although there are many types of hedge fund styles most pursue their returns across a broader range of investments including stocks bonds commodities currency and other global markets they are free to pursue returns by not only buying “long” positions they expect to rise in value but also selling “short” investments expected to fall in value being both long and short at the same time creates a type of “hedge” hence the name hedge funds and allows for the potential to profit when prices are both rising or falling although most hedge funds have historically had lower volatility than the sp  it is important to keep in mind that most hedge funds are considered riskier than individual investment grade bonds and indexed equity portfolios due to their diversification funds of hedge funds typically have lower volatility than most individual hedge funds what type of investor is most appropriate for steben select back to top we believe the fund may be appropriate for high net worth investors seeking capital appreciation who have a longterm time horizon and can bear the loss of some or all of their investment andor the risks associated with a lack of liquidity steben select is for accredited investors only accredited investors must meet certain income andor net worth thresholds where does this fund fit into a portfolio back to top hedge funds can be thought of as components of existing asset class allocations for instance a longshort equity hedge fund could be included within an equity allocation or a relative value fixed income hedge fund could be included within a fixed income allocation hedge funds can also be thought of as an investment that potentially captures different sources of return from traditional investments and could be a separate allocation as part of an overall allocation to alternative investments this is especially relevant for strategies that invest in multiple asset classes such as global macro but keep in mind that the fund may be highly leveraged and may increase the potential for losses and gains how are the underlying portfolio funds selected back to top narrowing the potential universe of over  hedge funds to the select list of managers in the fund is conducted by steben  company’s highly qualified research and risk management team the selection process is both quantitative and qualitative the quantitative screen reduces the number of potential candidates to around  to  funds this screen includes searching for managers with a track record of at least  years assets under management of over mm a low beta to equity indices and a low correlation to fixed income real estate investment trust reit and managed futures indices steben also screens for historically attractive risk adjusted return attributes steben then conducts qualitative due diligence — investment and operational — to further narrow the list to the select number of funds chosen what is the liquidity of an investment in the fund back to top the fund intends to offer quarterly share repurchases through tender offers with  days written notice an initial payment of  of the share price will be paid approximately  days after quarter end with the remaining  paid once the annual audit is completed share repurchases within the first  months of investing will incur an early withdrawal penalty of  the penalty goes to the fund and serves to offset the impact on other fund investors of penalties imposed from withdrawals of investments in the sub funds through the master fund is steben select multistrategy fund a mutual fund back to top steben select fund is not a mutual fund it is a closedend investment management company registered under the investment company act of  the fund invests in the master fund which allocates its assets among a number of hedge funds what are the fees of the investment back to top steben select charges the following fees management fee  operating expenses  servicing fee  early withdrawal fee  within first  months see  for more information in addition to the management fee the fund will also bear the management and incentive fees charged by the underlying hedge funds estimated at  per year this figure is estimated by incorporating actual historical management fees and fund expenses and by applying actual incentive fee rates to the realized fund performance as included in the audited financial statements march  for each of the portfolio funds in which the master fund intends to invest actual such amounts incurred by the master fund may be substantially higher or lower because the performance of the portfolio funds and hence their incentive fees may fluctuate and the master fund may invest in different portfolio funds from time to time these fees are not subject to any fee cap or the operating expense agreement with the investment manager steben  company what is steben’s role in managing the fund of hedge funds allocations back to top steben is the investment manager and is responsible for the selection due diligence and oversight of the hedge fund managers steben can increase or reduce the allocation to any of the hedge fund managers or hedge funds at any time and may withdraw from any of these funds or managers at any given time steben also oversees the delivery of performance reporting regular fund updates and tax reporting information what paperwork is required to invest in the fund back to top the fund may only be sold to accredited
