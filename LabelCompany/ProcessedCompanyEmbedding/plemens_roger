officer charles umberger executive vice president  chief lending officer our history during the summer of  a young franklin north carolina attorney gilmer a jones had the idea of organizing a building and loan association it was to have a longterm impact on the progress in macon county he recognized an urgent need for an institution offering citizens an opportunity to become homeowners and a depository that would pay a good rate of interest on individual savings in macon county the franklin press dated august   stated “an organization that is destined to do more for the upbuilding of our town than anything that has ever been attempted here was formed last saturday night” mr jones’ idea became reality on october   when the macon county building and loan association opened its office upstairs above the bank of franklin building the association remained small for several years even during the real estate “bust” and the great depression of the early ’s not a penny was lost on a loan by  assets had grown to  million the original small office had become inadequate and a full time manager was needed in  the association moved to a building at the corner of west main and maple street that same year they signed up for insurance of deposits provided by the federal savings and loan insurance corporation the rate of growth increased sharply thereafter in october of  macon building and loan association changed its name to macon savings and loan association macon savings continued to grow and as the bank approached its th year opened its first branch office in downtown murphy in  in  franklin’s main branch moved into the new colonialstyle building located in the heart of downtown franklin on june   during a severe electrical storm the building was struck by lightning and completely destroyed although disaster had struck macon savings never missed an hour of service the drivethru lanes were kept open and other operations were moved to the maple street location until reconstruction was completed a year later macon savings and loan association became macon savings bank in  and continued to enjoy record growth since  now known as simply macon bank nine more branches have been opened including another in franklin at holly springs plaza one in highlands brevard sylva cashiers columbus saluda and two in hendersonville in september  macon bank converted to a stock form of organization entegra financial corp became the new holding company of macon bank with the sale of stock completed and capital raised macon bank began to offer enhanced products and services to customers in the bank’s traditional “home” communities and to expand into new markets the board of directors decided the move into new markets and in february  realized they would be more successful if the bank’s name were changed to entegra bank this change became effective october   in  the bank opened a loan production office in greenville sc by the end of  that office had become a fullservice
