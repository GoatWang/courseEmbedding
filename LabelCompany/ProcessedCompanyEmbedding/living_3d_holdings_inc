discussion summarizes the material changes in our results of operations and our financial condition for the three months ended march   and march   the statements of operations is included in the financial statements attached to this report please refer to the statements of operations results of operations for the three months ended march   and  results from operations revenues for the three months ended march   and march   revenues were  and  respectively an increase of  the revenues for the three months ended march   represented design fee received and there were no such sales for the three months ended march   moreover the company is still in the early stage of development and its sales fluctuate cost of revenue the companys cost of revenue increased to  from  in the period ended march   compared to the same period in  the increase was due to the increase in sales gross profit for the three months ended march   the gross profit was  compared with  for the same period in  the increase was because of the increase in sales net loss for the three months ended march   the operating loss was  and for the same period ended march   the operating loss was  an increase of  the increase of operating loss between the periods was explained by the increase in general and administrative expenses discussed above liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents as of march   and december   were  and  respectively there were no substantial movements in the funds used in operating activities as merely all the expenses of the company were paid by man wah stephen yip and so ka yan on behalf of the company liquidity and capital resources current and expected liquidity historically we have financed operations primarily through the issuance of debt in the near future as additional capital is needed we expect to rely primarily on loans from our major shareholder and the sale of equity securities our cash flows provided by operating activities increased by  from  at march   to  at march   due principally to the increase in accounts payable of  accrued liabilities and other payables of   offset by the net loss of  we will require substantial additional capital to develop a market for d products the oo ecommerce platform and implement our business plan we plan to pursue financing from private investors and institutions in and outside the prc we do not have any commitments for additional financing such new financing could include equity which would likely be dilutive to our shareholders or debt which would likely restrict our ability to borrow from other sources in addition such securities may contain rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our current shareholders there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may have to materially curtail our operations any inability to raise adequate funds could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition due to the uncertainties related to these matters there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern capital commitments we had no material commitments for capital expenditures offbalance sheet arrangements there were no offbalance sheet arrangements as of march

condition for the three months ended march   and march    the statements of operations is included in the financial statements attached to this report  please refer to the statements of operations   results of operations for the three months ended march   and  results from operations revenues   for the three months ended march   and march   revenues were  and  respectively an increase of   the revenues for the three months ended march   represented design fee received and there were no such sales for the three months ended march   moreover the company is still in the early stage of development and its sales fluctuate cost of revenue the company’s cost of revenue increased to  from  in the period ended march   compared to the same period in   the increase was due to the increase in sales gross profit for the three months ended march   the gross profit was  compared with  for the same period in  the increase was because of the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses   for the three months ended march   and march   general and administrative expenses were  and  respectively an increase of  the increase in such expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in consultancy fee paid to our consultant and the increase in motor vehicle running expenses no such expenses were incurred by the company for the three months ended march   net loss   for the three months ended march   the operating loss was  and for the same period ended march   the operating loss was  an increase of   the increase of operating loss between the periods was explained by the increase in general and administrative expenses discussed above liquidity and capital resources   cash and cash equivalents as of march   and december   were  and  respectively  there were no substantial movements in the funds used in operating activities as merely all the expenses of the company were paid by man wah stephen yip and so ka yan on behalf of the company liquidity and capital resources current and expected liquidity historically we have financed operations primarily through the issuance of debt  in the near future as additional capital is needed we expect to rely primarily on loans from our major shareholder and the sale of equity securities  we financed operations by increasing the amount due to related parties to  at march   from  at december   an increase of   the increase is due principally to professional fees paid by related parties on behalf of the company for the services rendered in the period of    our cash flows provided by operating activities increased by  from  at march   to  at march   due principally to the increase in accounts payable of  accrued liabilities and other payables of   offset by the net loss of  we will require substantial additional capital to develop a market for d products the oo ecommerce platform and implement our business plan  we plan to pursue financing from private investors and institutions in and outside the prc  we do not have any commitments for additional financing such new financing could include equity which would likely be dilutive to our shareholders or debt which would likely restrict our ability to borrow from other sources  in addition such securities may contain rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our current shareholders   there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  if adequate funds are not available we may have to materially curtail our operations  any inability to raise adequate funds could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition due to the uncertainties related to these matters there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern capital commitments we had no material commitments for capital expenditures offbalance sheet arrangements there were no offbalance sheet arrangements as of march   critical accounting policies and estimates  accounting estimates    the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results when ultimately realized could differ from those estimates fair value of financial instruments   the carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash other receivables accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their fair value due to the relatively shortterm nature of these instruments revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer including factors such as when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery or service has been performed the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable the company recognizes sales when the merchandise is shipped title has passed to the customers or the service is provided and collectability is reasonably assured foreign currency translation   living d holdings inc maintains its books and accounting records in united states dollars with the united states dollars being the functional currency sugar technology group holdings corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary maintain their books and accounting records in hong kong dollars with the hong kong dollars being the functional currency transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date   we follow fasb asc  foreign currency translation for both the translation and remeasurement of balance sheet and income statement items into us dollars  resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity income taxes   income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date  a valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that based on available evidence are not expected to be realized   related parties   a party is considered to be related to the company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries controls is controlled by or is under common control with the company  related parties also include principal shareholders of the company its management members of the immediate families of principal shareholders of the company and its management and other parties with which the company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests  a party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party recent

accounting and financial reporting and iii appoint additional independent directors that can serve as members of an audit committee the remediation efforts will be largely dependent upon our securing
