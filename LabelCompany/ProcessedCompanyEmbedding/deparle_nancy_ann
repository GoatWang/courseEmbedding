january  from march  to february  she was counselor to the president and director of the white house office of health reform for more than  years leaders from both parties struggled to bring affordable health care to all americans when president obama took up the fight many people predicted defeat three years  repeal votes one supreme court decision and a presidential election later some are questioning whether government is capable of implementing the historic law concern is understandable the affordable care act aca transforms a healthcare system that accounts for onesixth of the us economy and is central to our lives but recent history shows that big changes in healthcare policy can be implemented the worries being voiced are familiar to those who follow healthcare policy they’re certainly familiar to me i became the administrator of medicare and medicaid in  just as congress passed the most sweeping changes in medicare’s history the balanced budget act of  cut nearly  billion from providers such as doctors hospitals and nursing homes cracked down on waste and fraud created a new medicare hmo program and launched the children’s health insurance program chip with a goal of covering millions of uninsured children even members of congress who voted for the law soon questioned whether it could work critics said that it was too big and complicated that payment reductions would drive doctors and hospitals out of business and strand senior citizens without care and that states would not cooperate in enrolling children in chip some predicted a yk crisis that would cripple government computers in fact the law saved billions more than originally projected and extended the life of the medicare “trust fund” by almost a quartercentury we modernized payment systems and cut medicare waste and fraud nearly in half millions of children in every state were insured thanks to chip  of  full screen autoplay close skip ad × tom toles on health care view photos a collection of cartoons on the debate caption a collection of cartoons on the debate   buy photo wait  second to continue a few years later similar doubts surrounded the launch of two republican initiatives president george w bush’s medicare prescription drug plan and mitt romney’s healthcare reform in massachusetts today the medicare prescription drug benefit helps millions of seniors and the massachusetts plan is a model for the nation soon the affordable care act will add a new chapter to this history of realworld success critics say the law is complex they are right when obama first took office  million americans were uninsured premiums had more than doubled in the preceding decade and insurers could deny coverage to those who needed it most if easy solutions existed someone would have found them long ago the aca tackles these problems it provides nearuniversal coverage by requiring everyone who can afford coverage to have it expanding medicaid for the poorest and subsidizing those who are lowincome or whose employers do not provide coverage and creating online “health insurance marketplaces” where consumers and small businesses can shop for private plans competing on price and quality much has been made of the states that have not established marketplaces governors who chose to sit on the sidelines made the wrong call but the federal government is ready to step in working with insurers states and others the obama administration has been quietly testing the new system — tapping many of the officials who helped implement the balanced budget act and the medicare drug benefit — to ensure that it works and although public discussion of the aca has been contentious i have been part of pragmatic behindthescenes conversations with state officials and businesspeople invested in the law’s success critics say the law fails to bring down healthcare costs a review of the facts is in order if you get insurance at work the new law will not disrupt your coverage or make it more expensive and premiums will fall for the overwhelming majority of consumers in the new marketplaces as coverage expands administrative costs are reduced and discrimination based on gender and age is curbed in  alone  million americans will get tax credits making health insurance more affordable the law includes virtually every big idea put forward to promote efficiency such as rewarding doctors and hospitals for their quality — not quantity — of care these policies are making a difference over the past three years healthcare costs have grown at their lowest level in  years reforms such as the penalties to hospitals with too many preventable readmissions are reducing spending skeptics ask whether consumers will buy insurance when the marketplaces open a fouryear partisan campaign to confuse the american people about “obamacare” hasn’t helped the enrollment effort and congress has denied the department of health and human services the resources it needs to inform the american people about the law private organizations such as enroll america are working to fill the gap insurance companies also have added incentives to compete for new customers amid predictions of failure reforms that were unthinkable a few years ago are already the law of the land just ask the  million young americans insured through their parents’ plans thanks to the aca largescale change is never easy but recent healthcare reforms have outperformed their critics when the affordable care act does the same obamacare will have completed its journey
