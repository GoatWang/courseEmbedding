clinical insights into each aspect of the drug discovery and development process we are creating a novel paradigm in cancer treatment with the goal of providing better therapies for patients in need our pipeline presentations  publications  howard a burris md phase  safety of icos agonist antibody jtx alone and with nivolumab nivo in advanced solid tumors predicted vs observed pharmacokinetics pk in iconic presented at the asco annual meeting june   heather a hirsch et al biomarker driven indication selection in jtx iconic clinical trial presented at the asco annual meeting june   olivia sears et al iconic phase  trial of icos agonist jtx alone and in combination with nivolumab nivo presented at the aacr annual meeting april   jennifer michaelson preclinical assessment of jtx an agonist antibody targeting icos supports evaluation in iconic clinical trial presented at the aacr annual meeting april   about our collaboration with celgene in july  we entered a global collaboration with celgene focused on developing and commercializing innovative immunooncology treatments for patients with cancer the collaboration includes options on our lead product candidate jtx targeting icos up to four early stage programs to be selected from a defined pool of b cell t regulatory cell and tumorassociated macrophage targets emerging from the jounce translational science platform and an additional option to equally share a checkpoint immunooncology program learn more icos agonist program – jtx our lead product candidate jtx is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates the inducible t cell costimulator icos a protein on the surface of certain t cells that we believe will stimulate an immune response against a patient’s cancer jtx is intended to treat solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with other therapies and is currently being evaluated in a phase  clinical trial the iconic trial jtx is based on insights generated by our founders drs jim allison and padmanee pam sharma which showed that elevated expression of icos correlated with positive clinical outcomes and subsequently that providing an agonist signal through icos leads to antitumor activity in vivo their experience paved the way for our translational approach based on these insights and additional preclinical evidence we initiated our icos program and discovered an agonist monoclonal antibody clinical candidate jtx which is currently in indenabling studies and identified biomarkers that can be used to classify patients to look for enhanced response rates in our clinical trials learn more about the iconic trial beyond t cells most firstwave immunotherapy treatments have focused on activating t cells within tumors an approach that has successfully led to medicines that are making a difference in patients’ lives however many patients still do not achieve longlasting responses on these treatments this may occur for two reasons  insufficient numbers of t cells within a certain tumor or tumor type or  the presence of suppressive mechanisms that inhibit or reduce the activity of the immune system in both of these scenarios therapies targeting t cells are less likely to be successful we believe that the ability to target different immune cell types such as innate immune cells may allow us to  pursue tumor types not currently served by therapies which target adaptive immune cells as well as  potentially convert the tme from an immunosuppressive environment to an immuneactivating environment we believe our differentiated approach to understanding and interrogating these other immune cell types competitively positions us to exploit the promise of immunotherapy in cancer our translational approach led us to characterize large numbers of human tumors in which the innate immune or stromal mechanisms may be suppressing or repelling the immune system within the tme we have strived to create a balanced pipeline with both t cell and beyond t cell programs in order to optimize the use of the immune system and to couple this pipeline with novel patient selection strategies jounce’s lead beyond t cell program is aimed at disrupting the interaction of targets on tumorassociated macrophages tams to skew the composition of macrophages within the tumor from immunesuppressing to immuneactivating the tumor microenvironment the tumor microenvironment tme refers to the cellular environment that makes up a tumor this environment includes blood vessels immune cells fibroblasts myeloid cells lymphocytes signaling molecules and the extracellular matrix our approach to identifying novel targets and mechanisms while initially focused on tams is a repeatable approach that we believe can be applied to other cell types in the tumor microenvironment tumorassociated macrophages tams jounces lead beyond t cell program is aimed at disrupting the interaction of targets on tumorassociated macrophages tams to skew the composition of macrophages within the tumor from immunesuppressing to immune activating × about the iconic trial the iconic trial icos agonist antibody for immunotherapy in cancer patients with its fourpart adaptive design will initially assess safety and tolerability and then preliminary efficacy of jtx as both a monotherapy and in combination with the pd inhibitor nivolumab marketed as opdivo® the initial phase of iconic will be a doseescalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose mtd and recommended phase  dose rpd the second phase of iconic will focus on diseasespecific expansion cohorts in solid tumors that the company has identified using its translational science platform as having the highest numbers of icosexpressing t cells and other icosrelated biomarkers an approach supported by preclinical work jounce plans to enroll approximately  patients in the iconic trial at  premier oncology sites in the us learn more at clinicaltrialsgov contact us jounce therapeutics inc  memorial

federal agency or us government obligations the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and the immunooncology subsector are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property while we believe that our product candidate discovery programs technology knowledge experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions governmental agencies and public and private research institutions among others any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any complementary diagnostics andor

trillium therapeutics inc tti in phase i the availability of reimbursement from government and other thirdparty payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development manufacturing preclinical testing conducting clinical trials obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs company description we are a clinical stage immunotherapy company dedicated to transforming the treatment of cancer by developing therapies that enable the immune system to attack tumors and provide longlasting benefits to patients through the use of our translational science platform we first focus on specific cell types within tumors to prioritize targets and then identify related biomarkers designed to match the right therapy to the right patient our strategy is to create immunotherapies targeting a variety of the diverse cellular components of the immune system as well as nonimmune cells resident within the tumor all of which can vary greatly among tumors within and across indications this may provide benefit to patients with tumors across the spectrum from highly inflamed or hot to poorly inflamed or cold and especially those not well served by current therapies we believe the early identification of potential predictive biomarkers to prospectively enrich for biomarker positive cancer patients from across many indications may lead to shortened development timelines for our new immunotherapies our approach is designed to lead to a larger effect size by first identifying and then focusing on a smaller biomarker positive study population through this twopronged approach we believe our translational science platform enables us to effectively and efficiently identify and develop new cancer immunotherapies • targeting t cells our lead product candidate jtx is a clinical stage monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates icos a protein on the surface of certain t cells commonly found in many solid tumors we believe our jtx antibody has a dual mechanism of action that serves to amplify an immune response in t effector cells or good t cells while preferentially reducing the number of t regulatory cells or bad t cells within a tumor our preclinical data demonstrates that jtx stimulates a significant t cell immune response against solid tumors we submitted our investigational new drug application or ind for jtx to the food and drug administration or fda in july  and began our jtx multiarm phase iii clinical trial in patients with solid tumors in august  we believe jtx has the potential to act both as a single agent and more importantly in combination with other therapies such as antipd antibodies to offer treatment alternatives to patients who otherwise lack an effective response to currently approved therapies we are also conducting ind enabling studies for jtx an antipd antibody for use in future combinations with jtx as well as for use in combination with other future product candidates as we believe combination therapy has the potential to be a mainstay of cancer immunotherapy safety data from our multiarm phase iii jtx trial is expected in the first half of  and preliminary efficacy proof of concept data is expected in the second half  in both the single agent and combination setting • beyond t effector cells we are discovering and developing immunotherapies beyond the currently approved products targeting t effector cells to do so we are leveraging our translational science platform to systematically and comprehensively interrogate cell types within the human tumor microenvironment or tme to enable us to develop therapies with the potential to benefit patients with tumors across the spectrum from hot to cold this includes focusing on adaptive and innate immune cells such as b and t regulatory cells and immunosuppressive macrophages respectively therapies targeting these cell types and cell subsets may have the potential to complement existing approaches that focus on t effector cells and thereby benefit many patients who do not respond to the currently approved t effector cellfocused immunotherapies in addition we are discovering and developing multiple approaches including targeting stromal cells with the potential to convert cold tumors to hot tumors thereby making the tumors more amenable to immunotherapy perhaps in combination approaches • identifying potential predictive biomarkers to prioritize indications and match the right therapy to the right patients early in the development process we use our translational science platform to identify potential predictive biomarkers designed to enable us to enrich for a patient population more likely to respond to our immunotherapy in addition we can also use characteristics defined by our biomarker efforts to focus on niche indications andor niche subsets within indications to inform our clinical strategy by taking this biomarkerdriven approach which supports enrichedenrollment clinical trial design by stratifying patients and focusing on the biomarker positive patients whose tumors express our biomarkers of interest we believe that we can more efficiently develop our cancer immunotherapies the biomarker results coordinated to clinical response will determine the utility of proceeding to the use of a complementary diagnostic andor companion diagnostic for a given therapy our ability to prioritize targets and potential predictive biomarkers using our translational science platform was a key component leading to our recently announced strategic collaboration with celgene corporation or celgene this global strategic collaboration which included a  million upfront payment and a  million equity investment is primarily focused on codeveloping and cocommercializing innovative biologic immunotherapy treatments for patients with cancer under the agreement we granted celgene exclusive options to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate jtx and up to four earlystage programs consisting of targets to be selected from a pool of certain b cell t regulatory cell and tumorassociated macrophage targets additionally celgene has an exclusive option to develop and commercialize our product candidate jtx which upon exercise of such option will be a shared program that may be used by both parties in and outside of the collaboration under the terms of the agreement if celgene exercises all of its options all programs meet all milestones including regulatory approvals in the united states and outside the united states and celgene extends the initial fouryear research term for three additional years we are eligible to earn additional clinical regulatory andor commercialization milestone payments optionexercise fees and research term extension fees in addition to progressing collaboration programs we will continue to use our translational science platform to progress our own programs that are not part of the collaboration and for which we retain worldwide commercial rights immunotherapies are increasingly recognized as a critical component of cancer therapy and are beginning to fundamentally change the paradigm for treating patients fewer than half of all cancer patients respond to single agent immunotherapies combination therapies are beginning to yield greater responses than single agent therapies yet there is still significant unmet medical need among large patient populations across most solid tumor indications in addition there is a significant number of patients with tumors that lack or have low levels of immune cell infiltrate where additional approaches may be required to fully realize the benefit of immunotherapy agents we believe targeting novel immune mechanisms in combination with identifying and using predictive biomarkers may best address these areas of unmet need our translational science platform utilizes a suite of integrated technologies to comprehensively profile the cellular and molecular characteristics within thousands of human solid tumors providing critical information about the tme that we believe will allow us to identify and guide new immunotherapies more efficiently through development we utilize a systematic approach to match targets to defined patient populations as well as niche indications andor niche subsets within indications that we believe are more likely to benefit from these therapies building on our biomarkerdriven strategy we aim to establish complementary diagnostics andor companion diagnostics for each of our product candidates to identify the right patients for treatment jtx our lead program has shown preclinical antitumor effects both as a single agent and in combination with existing immunotherapies such as antipd antibodies single agent efficacy in preclinical models is correlated with the percentage of icosexpressing t cells in the tumor using our translational science platform we have identified human cancer indications that display high percentages of icosexpressing t cells and icosrelated biomarkers within the tumors based on this we have prioritized certain indications including nonsmall cell lung cancer or nsclc head and neck squamous cell cancer or hnscc and additional niche indications for evaluation in our ongoing jtx single agent trial furthermore individual patient tumors from the selected indications will be evaluated during clinical trial enrollment for icos and related biomarkers so that we can enrich our trials with patients who may be more likely to respond to jtx we are also using our translational science platform and biomarkerdriven strategy to identify additional niche indications andor niche subsets within indications that may be particularly amenable to jtx therapy and may provide additional patient populations for evaluation in our clinical studies in addition because existing immunotherapies such as antipdantipdl antibodies may induce icos upregulation on t cells we believe that in a combination setting jtx may exert antitumor activity in a broader group of indications and thus provide benefit to a greater number of patients as a result our ongoing phase iii multiarm trial will also assess the safety and efficacy of jtx in combination with the antipd antibody nivolumab in patients with nsclc hnscc triple negative breast cancer or tnbc melanoma stomach cancer and additional niche indications identified through our translational science platform assuming continued successful development our expectation is that our antipd antibody jtx that is currently in indenabling studies will be included in subsequent clinical studies the majority of immunotherapy discovery and development efforts have focused on t cell targeted therapies particularly t effector cells which have provided longlasting benefits to some patients but significant unmet medical need remains as such we have focused our early discovery efforts on interrogating multiple cell types we believe our approach will identify novel immunotherapies that engage different elements of the immune system and stroma and can address the broader unmet medical need across solid tumor indications our discovery pipeline consists of multiple programs including several that target immunosuppressive macrophages which are highly prevalent in many solid tumor types as well as programs aimed at converting cold tumors to hot tumors we believe these approaches may create options for patients who are less likely to respond to currently approved therapies as well as enhance responses in patients who have had limited response to currently approved immunotherapies  we were incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in march  our

cancer immunotherapy cancer immunotherapy aims to treat patients by mobilizing the immune system to recognize and attack tumors based on the groundbreaking initial research and discoveries by our founders we aim to revolutionize the immunotherapy field through our translational science platform what makes us different advancing a pipeline of innovative cancer therapies immunotherapies are increasingly recognized as a critical component of cancer therapy and are beginning to fundamentally change the paradigm for treating patients however due to a general lack of predictive biomarkers to identify responsive patient populations fewer than half of all cancer patients respond to these immunotherapies as single agents combination therapies are beginning to yield greater responses than single agent therapies although there is still significant unmet medical need across large patient populations developing unparalleled immunologic insights into tumors in order to match the right therapies to the right patients our translational science platform utilizes a suite of integrated technologies to profile the immune cellular and molecular characteristics within thousands of human solid tumors providing critical information on the tumor microenvironment tme that allows us to identify and guide new immunotherapies more efficiently through development we utilize a systematic approach to match targets to defined patient populations that we believe are more likely to benefit from these therapies – allowing us to distinguish and prioritize targets versus making a more random choice if our biomarkerdriven strategies are successful we anticipate developing a companion diagnostic for each product we believe that we can facilitate a systematic means of novel immunotherapy discovery enroll biomarkerdefined patient populations in clinical trials and develop therapies alone or in combination that will have a meaningful and longlasting impact on the lives of cancer patients what does that mean for patients if our strategies are successful we anticipate more robust and rapid achievement of human proof of concept and shorter times to deliver novel therapies to

pharmacokinetics pk in iconic presented at the asco annual meeting june   heather a hirsch et al biomarker driven indication selection in jtx iconic clinical trial presented at the asco annual meeting june   olivia sears et al iconic phase  trial of icos agonist jtx alone and in combination with nivolumab nivo presented at the aacr annual meeting april   jennifer michaelson preclinical assessment of jtx an agonist antibody targeting icos supports evaluation in iconic clinical trial presented at the aacr annual meeting april   about our collaboration with celgene in july  we entered a global collaboration with celgene focused on developing and commercializing innovative immunooncology treatments for patients with cancer the collaboration includes options on our lead product candidate jtx targeting icos up to four early stage programs to be selected from a defined pool of b cell t regulatory cell and tumorassociated macrophage targets emerging from the jounce translational science platform and an additional option to equally share a checkpoint immunooncology program learn more icos agonist program – jtx our lead product candidate jtx is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates the inducible t cell costimulator icos a protein on the surface of certain t cells that we believe will stimulate an immune response against a patient’s cancer jtx is intended to treat solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with other therapies and is currently being evaluated in a phase  clinical trial the iconic trial jtx is based on insights generated by our founders drs jim allison and padmanee pam sharma which showed that elevated expression of icos correlated with positive clinical outcomes and subsequently that providing an agonist signal through icos leads to antitumor activity in vivo their experience paved the way for our translational approach based on these insights and additional preclinical evidence we initiated our icos program and discovered an agonist monoclonal antibody clinical candidate jtx which is currently in indenabling studies and identified biomarkers that can be used to classify patients to look for enhanced response rates in our clinical trials learn more about the iconic trial beyond t cells most firstwave immunotherapy treatments have focused on activating t cells within tumors an approach that has successfully led to medicines that are making a difference in patients’ lives however many patients still do not achieve longlasting responses on these treatments this may occur for two reasons  insufficient numbers of t cells within a certain tumor or tumor type or  the presence of suppressive mechanisms that inhibit or reduce the activity of the immune system in both of these scenarios therapies targeting t cells are less likely to be successful we believe that the ability to target different immune cell types such as innate immune cells may allow us to  pursue tumor types not currently served by therapies which target adaptive immune cells as well as  potentially convert the tme from an immunosuppressive environment to an immuneactivating environment we believe our differentiated approach to understanding and interrogating these other immune cell types competitively positions us to exploit the promise of immunotherapy in cancer our translational approach led us to characterize large numbers of human tumors in which the innate immune or stromal mechanisms may be suppressing or repelling the immune system within the tme we have strived to create a balanced pipeline with both t cell and beyond t cell programs in order to optimize the use of the immune system and to couple this pipeline with novel patient selection strategies jounce’s lead beyond t cell program is aimed at disrupting the interaction of targets on tumorassociated macrophages tams to skew the composition of macrophages within the tumor from immunesuppressing to immuneactivating the tumor microenvironment the tumor microenvironment tme refers to the cellular environment that makes up a tumor this environment includes blood vessels immune cells fibroblasts myeloid cells lymphocytes signaling molecules and the extracellular matrix our approach to identifying novel targets and mechanisms while initially focused on tams is a repeatable approach that we believe can be applied to other cell types in the tumor microenvironment tumorassociated macrophages tams jounces lead beyond t cell program is aimed at disrupting the interaction of targets on tumorassociated macrophages tams to skew the composition of macrophages within the tumor from immunesuppressing to immune activating × about the iconic trial the iconic trial icos agonist antibody for immunotherapy in cancer patients with its fourpart adaptive design will initially assess safety and tolerability and then preliminary efficacy of jtx as both a monotherapy and in combination with the pd inhibitor nivolumab marketed as opdivo® the initial phase of iconic will be a doseescalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose mtd and recommended phase  dose rpd the second phase of iconic will focus on diseasespecific expansion
