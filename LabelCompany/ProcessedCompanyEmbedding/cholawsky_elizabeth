webinars  popular posts september   crossing the chasm for the internet of things january   supportcom president and ceo elizabeth cholawsky talks about winning frost  sullivan’s “company of the year” award may   redefining support for a connected iot world how “support interaction optimization” will reshape the world of customer supportby elizabeth cholawskyposted on december   in nexus® support interaction optimization one of the most exciting parts of running a company involves helping it keep its bearings while its industry undergoes a fundamental transformation which is why i’m proud to be at supportcom as it takes a leadership position in support interaction optimization a new industry category that responds to tectonic marketplace shifts by bringing sophisticated technology to the persontoperson interaction that is at the heart of most support operations we’re doing this with our flagship product nexus® which is the commercialized version of the inhouse software that’s been the backbone of supportcom’s operations for over a decade a complete description of sio and how nexus is poised to take advantage of it to transform the world of contact centers and customer support is contained in the exclusive report being released today from frost  sullivan the distinguished research and consulting company but i’d like to use this post to give my ceo’s perspective on what is happening in our industry and how sio represents its future direction and what i see are two major forces at work first companies have been using technology for many years to enhance their customer service operations this begins even before a support call is answered with integrated computertelephony systems that figure out who the customer is from information in the customer database and route the call appropriately we’ve become quite skilled at using interactive voice response technology to determine what the call is about and match the call type with an agent’s skill and once the right agent is located the agent’s screen is filled automatically with all of the information on hand about the caller but then the technology and the software come to an abrupt halt it’s just the two people — the agent and the customer — oneonone for the most crucial part of the process the part that most customers will remember about the entire experience agents are forced to work without any sort of technology safety net the situation is obviously not acceptable and one of the main tasks of sio is to use technology to optimize this final frontier in customer support the live interaction between the caller with a technical issue and the agent trying to solve the problem the biggest sio assist in nexus comes in the form of “guided paths™” guided paths have captured the company’s knowledge of their product — its “secret sauce” — and then formats that information into the form of steps an agent should take with any particular issue that might come up a critical improvement that sio brings to this process is that these steps are whenever possible automated the good news is that this happens without needing to call in programmers from the it department to write custom code for example if remote operation software is needed at a particular point in a support call it will be triggered automatically by the sio platform agents shouldn’t need to spend their time launching exe files they should be helping customers with their problems this capability i believe gives companies the ability as we like to say “to make every agent their best agent” it also brings us closer to the day when companies can offer entirely automated support that is every bit as robust and helpful as what can be attained by the very best contact center is today so why are we hearing about sio now it’s because of the second force that i see at work in today’s tech support world that market is expanding in two directions in the number of products that companies are being called on to support and in the quality of the support they are being expected to deliver that first part should be pretty clear to everyone who’s been following technology a few years ago “support” was most commonly associated with computers now it involves a growing family of new devices tablets smart phones and the like and in the very near future we will be seeing even more devices as the “internet of things” brings smart connected products to the home and work place not only are there more products to support but there has been a dramatic increase in the expectations that customers bring to the support experience they are increasingly likely to drop products because of a support encounter they weren’t happy with and odds are good that they’ll take their complaint to social media channels in the process frost  sullivan’s report captures another element of changing customer expectations as it pertains to a new generation of customers “younger customers in particular have become more impatient demanding and knowledgeable” says the report “more and more generation y consumers insist on ‘omnichannel support’ – a coherent seamless customer experience regardless of the channel through which they engage a business from facetoface service to selfservice or support agents” those words accurately describe a phenomenon we see every day with our supportcom customers and as mentioned they’re a key driver of support interaction optimization a phenomenon that will be dominating the support industry in the coming years with nexus and with other innovations that we have in the pipeline supportcom plans to keep helping our customers stay ahead of the curve even as so much of the support industry changes around them summaryarticle namehow support interaction optimization will reshape

manager of it support product line citrix part  posted on monday sep th  next»» we’ve featured citrix on the blog before this time we’re going to discuss the wonderful things that citrix is doing in the cloud sramana mitra hi elizabeth let’s start with a bit of your personal background as well as what citrix is doing in the area of cloudbased support elizabeth cholawsky right now i am the general manager for the it support line of business at citrix which includes all of the gotoassist branded products i took this position a couple of years ago but when i first joined citrix i was the vp of product management and client services client services runs through my career for the past  plus years when we decided to focus on it support it was a natural segue from running our contact center operations and support operations to managing the business for these products sm what business line are you responsible for what does it cover ec it’s all of the gotoassist branded products that’s two main product lines one is called gotoassist corporate that’s the first product that was produced by the startup expert city which has become the online services division for citrix gotoassist was the first product on the market that allowed a support professional to be able to do screen sharing and remote access of pcs over  years ago we made the market in the it support area we’ve grown that product and added to it and we now own the majority market share for remote support worldwide we have about  market share the gotoassist corporate product is focused on the support of people live support of people it’s used by huge contact centers from companies such as bt verizon dell and fedex all the way down to smbs that find the need for sophisticated support of people in a live environment in the past four years we added a product platform it’s branded just gotoassist and it’s a modular platform if you are a gotoassist customer you can buy just a remote support module or a monitoring module we added that to the support capabilities a couple years ago for alarming alerting and monitoring machines that might be unattended the gotoassist platform is an integrated set of cloudbased tools for supporting both people and technology you’ll see in the next few months other things that we will add to that in a modular fashion to provide the tool set for support for a small company that product has close to  customers using it today primarily smbs sm what’s the difference between the second product and the third one ec let me clarify the gotoassist corporate product is remote access and is focused on support of people a live session that’s one product the second product is gotoassist and it has different modules on it so there are just two product lines some of our clients just use the gotoassist monitoring modules they want to keep abreast of what’s going on in their networks if a machine is on or off or filling up disk space get an alarm or alert on it it also
