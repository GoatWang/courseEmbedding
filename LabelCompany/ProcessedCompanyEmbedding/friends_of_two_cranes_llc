optimize species recovery the population growth of endangered whooping cranes grus americana hinges on juvenile recruitment therefore we identify climatic drivers solar activity sunspots and weather of whooping crane recruitment throughout the species’ life cycle breeding migration wintering method and model our method uses a repeated crossvalidated absolute shrinkage and selection operator approach to identify drivers of recruitment we model effects of climate change on those drivers to predict whooping crane population growth given alternative scenarios of climate change and solar activity years with fewer sunspots indicated greater recruitment increased precipitation during autumn migration signified less recruitment on the breeding grounds fewer days below freezing during winter and more precipitation during breeding suggested less recruitment we predicted whooping crane recruitment and population growth may fall below longterm averages during all solar cycles when atmospheric co concentration increases as expected to  ppm by  species recovery during a typical solar cycle with  ppm may require eight times longer than conditions without climate change and the

loyalty is a two way street toggle slidingbar area facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagramlinkedinemail loyalty is a two way street homecommunication powerhouseloyalty is a two way street previous next loyalty is a two way street loyalty and relationships  many people have asked me why is it that  cranes has been able to continue to grow and thrive for over  years  i always tell them it’s because we have loyal clients and we are loyal to them  they call on  cranes to help them and they support us continuously when we start innovative new programs potential conflict   we also know that if there is another client that may be a potential competitor we reach out to our current clients first before pursuing any business that could cause conflict  we show loyalty to our clients just as much as they show loyalty to us  having a loyal following and continued business relationship is important for sustaining your business  year anniversary  we are blessed to be celebrating our th year soon on september 0th  several friends of mine started their consulting practices in  when the recession was officially announced by the government  many of them were unable to survive because they had not built those long term relationships  in those dark years we had six projects that all dried up because customers needed to tighten their belts and reduce outside funding  i am very grateful that today we are still continuing our important work and also venturing into new projects  no doubt we would not have survived if it wasn’t for our loyal clients and continued growth appreciation  never take customers customer loyalty or customer relationships for granted  one thing that is so important in life and especially with clients is to continuously show respect to each other and value your customers  take the time to value your client’s patronage and truly work to understand their specific needs communication powerhouse tip of the week   loyalty is a two way street  when you begin negotiations with a client always remember the fourth principle of the  cranes philosophy which is “success comes from collaborative relationships” collaboration means that there is give and take   take the time to understand what the needs are of your clients and how you can best serve them with your skill set   make the effort to know what is important to them and as you start working with them loyalty is built from that long term collaboration what do you think it takes to build a long term collaboration what are the risks when you lose loyalty what can you do to build loyalty to your business or to yourself   i look forward to hearing your comments  feel free to comment below or contact naomi here admin 0t july th 0communication powerhousecomments off on loyalty is a two way
