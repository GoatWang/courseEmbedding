peter wege talks about steelcase going green retired steelcase chairman and philanthropist peter wege talks about the furniture companys decision to go green grand rapids mi — peter melvin wege loved giving away his money and give it away he did — millions of dollars in grants large and small — a fortune he had amassed as the former chairman and largest stockholder of steelcase inc the office furniture company his father founded wege of east grand rapids died monday july  at the age of  having made an indelible mark on grand rapids and much of the world wege pronounced wegee was an unconventional industrialist sometimes at odds with the area’s other prominent business leaders he wrote poetry and supported liberal as well as conservative candidates and causes saving the environment was his greatest passion “i want to be remembered as one of the people who tried to wake up the country on the environmental problems” he said in november  after sponsoring a nationwide conference of environmental leaders aimed at restoring the great lakes “i’m doing it for my children and my grandchildren” he said “it’s got to be taken seriously this time” related as last direct descendant of steelcases founding families peter wege focused on environment his gifts ranged from  to renovate and stock a library in chase a tiny lake county community to more than  million for the new grand rapids art museum which opened in  “he gets more pleasure out of the small gifts he gives than the great big ones” ellen satterlee the wege foundation’s ceo once said when the art museum’s board offered to name the new museum after him in exchange for his gift wege declined although it later christened the area outside the building the peter m wege plaza “that’s not his way of doing things” kate pew wolters cochair of the museum’s fundraising campaign said at the time mr wege was motivated by “having a quiet impact” she said “of using his resources to make change not with the thought that he’s going to get a lot of recognition for it” after giving millions to saint mary’s health care now mercy health saint marys he reluctantly agreed a new building could be named the peter m wege health and learning center but privately said it was named not for him but for his late father peter martin wege related peter weges profound influence pushed mercy health saint marys development peter melvin wege was born into privilege feb   in grand rapids eight years after his father cofounded the metal office furniture co forerunner of steelcase inc during the difficult pregnancy before his birth his mother sophia louise a devout catholic prayed “oh lord if you help me out i’ll devote my child to the blessed mary” “i got stigmatized right there” wege once joked his mother instilled in him a deep religious faith which in later years would guide his philanthropy as a teenager he attended the san diego army and navy academy then in  enrolled at the university of michigan where he set a record for the javelin throw which stood for  years he interrupted his education to enlist in the us army air corps in december  following the attack on pearl harbor he became a transport pilot ferrying aircraft from one place to another during world war ii it was in that capacity that he became concerned about the damage pollution was inflicting on people and their planet he often told about piloting an airplane into pittsburgh in  the smog was so thick he could not see to land after the war mr wege spent six years as a salesman for the company his father founded loading his station wagon with steelcase chairs and other supplies and heading across the country as the founder’s only son he was the company’s largest shareholder and he rose through the management ranks to become chairman but he never forgot the smog that shrouded pittsburgh a sign of prosperity in those years before the environmental movement “pittsburgh’s smog was my introduction to environmental pollution” he once wrote in  wege created the wege foundation and built its mission on five pillars education environment arts and culture health care and human services he gave its first gift to aquinas college and remained closely tied to the catholic college until his death in  he founded the center for environmental study in grand rapids at his urging steelcase went public allowing him in  to sell  million of his stock most of which he gave to his foundation in  he resigned as the company’s vice chairman to work fulltime on his foundation but he continued to use his economic leverage to push steelcase and other companies to recycle and take other environmentally responsible steps many of his gifts even those not directly tied to environmental causes came with the requirement that they be environmentally responsible he insisted that the buildings his money helped construct be leed leadership in energy and environmental design certified meaning they were energy efficient and met other green standards related peter wege west michigans dreamer was ahead of his time catholic leaders say “he was on to green building when nobody knew what leed meant” satterlee said in  inspired by his example the grand rapids art museum which opened its  million building in  became the first newlybuilt art museum in the world to achieve the top goldlevel leed certification “the gold standard was always our goal” wege said afterward he coined the word “economicology” combining the words “economy” and “ecology” “there’s no doubt you can make money and prevent pollution” he explained in  he published a book “economicology the eleventh commandment” offering his premise that a healthy economy and healthy ecology are compatible in  he published a sequel “economicology ii” coinciding with his th birthday in february in between in the spring of  he sponsored the “healing our waters” conference in grand rapids a meeting of some  environmentalists and scientists to develop a plan for dealing with what they saw as the three primary threats to the great lakes invasive species declining water quality and concentrations of toxic sediment “the lakes” wege said at the time “are our life support system and we’ve got to treat them that way people take it for granted we have to protect them” the result was a report “healing our waters an agenda for great lakes restoration” — a “magna carta for great lakes restoration” wege called it — urging the federal government to take the lead on a massive  billion dollar restoration of the big lakes robert kennedy jr senior attorney for the natural resources defense council called wege “one of my heroes i just treasure his wisdom and his advice” carl pope former executive director of the sierra club said “mr wege’s doing his part i think this is a test of whether we’re as committed to this as mr wege is” as it turned out the rest of the country wasn’t as committed wege didn’t live to see his beloved lakes restored to their natural state undeterred he continued his activism over the years he donated numerous tracts of land to nature conservancies gave the national wildlife federation  million to create a national schoolyard habitat program to teach young children about nature more than  million to protect the muskegon river watershed and an estimated  million to buy ecologically sensitive forest in costa rica he gave millions to the university of michigan’s school of natural resources including a  million gift in  for a graduate student fellowship and a professorship in sustainability he gave millions more to michigan state university grand valley state university and other colleges for environmental programs at his urging aquinas college created a degree in sustainable business but wege didn’t limit his giving to environmental causes the many organizations that benefited from his generosity include the grand rapids symphony the grand rapids ballet company the american cancer society saint mary’s health care and countless schools elementary through college in  at the dedication of the new cathedral square center the headquarters of the grand rapids catholic diocese at  s division ave downtown wege stood and pointed across the street to the building at  s division ave “i was born and raised in that third floor  years ago” he said then he stunned the crowd by pledging to give whatever was needed to complete the  million project a promise that could have totaled close to  million on that day despite all of that he tended to keep a lower profile than some of the area’s other philanthropists he preferred to keep his personal life private including the fact that he was married and divorced seven times he had a sensitive literary side as seen in his poems many drawn from nature if mankind could only realize that we all are a small part of the whole and we fit in the overall plan like a glove fits the hand he professed that his personal wealth was only as good as what it could accomplish a sentiment he learned from his father who “felt that the accumulation of wealth was not in the interest of anybody” mr wege said in a  interview “when you had enough for your retirement you certainly should be generous with the community” some years ago he made it clear he planned to leave his entire estate to his foundation so it could continue functioning after his death “i’m going to give away a lot” he once said “and there will be a lot left over” despite his advancing age he continued running his foundation well into his s he once said he wanted the foundation’s board composed mainly of his children to become more active in the decision making but it soon became clear he wasn’t interested in relinquishing control “it was obvious that wasn’t what he wanted” his oldest son peter martin wege ii once said “all we do is say ‘great job dad keep it up’ he keeps saying he’s going to retire but he never does we don’t believe him anyway this is what keeps him alive and keeps him going” but age eventually forced him to slow down in  he considered moving the foundation offices to a farmhouse he had restored near lowell but decided it would be better given his age if he kept it in his rambling east grand rapids home overlooking reeds lake that same year he was hospitalized briefly due to an irregular heartbeat still he kept the foundation’s small staff busy leaving them stacks of material to read when they arrived at the office each morning assigning them projects to look into almost as if he was driven to make a difference before he died terri mccarthy the foundation’s vice president in charge of programs once told him “if you stopped today you could look back and say ‘i don’t need to do one more thing’” mr wege responded “oh my goodness i still have so much to do” wege is survived by seven children mary goodwillie nelson susan carter peter martin wege ii christopher henry wege diana wege sherogan johanna osman jonathan michael wege he also is survived by  grandchildren and  greatgrandchildren pat shellenbarger contributed to this report jeffrey kaczmarczyk covers arts and entertainment for mlivegrand rapids press email him at

whatever was needed to complete the  million project a promise that could have totaled close to  million on that day despite all of that he tended to keep a lower profile than some of the area’s other philanthropists he preferred to keep his personal life private including the fact that he was married and divorced seven times he had a sensitive literary side as seen in his poems many drawn from nature if mankind could only realize that we all are a small part of the whole and we fit in the overall plan like a glove fits the hand he professed that his personal wealth was only as good as what it could accomplish a sentiment he learned from his father who “felt that the accumulation of wealth was not in the interest of anybody” mr wege said in a  interview “when you had enough for your retirement you certainly should be generous with the community” some years ago he made it clear he planned to leave his entire estate to his foundation so it could continue functioning after his death “i’m going to give away a lot” he once said “and there will be a lot left over” despite his advancing age he continued running his foundation well into his s he once said he wanted the foundation’s board composed mainly of his children to become more active in the decision making but it soon became clear he wasn’t interested in relinquishing control “it was obvious that wasn’t what he wanted” his oldest son peter martin wege ii once said “all we do is say ‘great job dad keep it up’ he keeps saying he’s going to retire but he never does we don’t believe him anyway this is what keeps him alive and keeps him going” but age eventually forced him to slow down in  he considered moving the foundation offices to a farmhouse he had restored near lowell but decided it would be better given his age if he kept it in his rambling east grand rapids home overlooking reeds lake that same year he was hospitalized briefly due to an irregular heartbeat still he kept the foundation’s small staff busy leaving them stacks of material to read when they arrived at the office each morning assigning them projects to look into almost as if he was driven to make a difference before he died terri mccarthy the foundation’s vice president in charge of programs once told him “if you stopped today you could look back and say ‘i don’t need to do one more thing’” mr wege responded “oh my goodness i still have so much to do” wege is survived by seven children mary goodwillie nelson susan carter peter martin wege ii christopher henry wege diana wege sherogan johanna osman jonathan michael wege he

and certainly of peter’s and of the wege foundation’s  some of you know i am retiring as ceo of the foundation peter started in  and where my career and heart have been ever since  for those who don’t i am writing to tell you myself so you don’t find out in the newspaper  each of you reading this has done what peter so believed in collaborated with the foundation and with me personally i don’t think i can fully express what your involvement has meant to me as it did to peter  who hasn’t heard me say “how did i get so lucky to have this job” what a privilege it was for me to work as peter’s right hand for  years until he died last summer  in an interview for the book being written for the th anniversary of the wege foundation i was asked to reflect on those years it is overwhelming when you see how very generous peter wege has been over the years  for a long time i have said that i was probably the only one who really had any idea because i saw both sides—foundation and personal i don’t even think he realizes the extent because he really doesn’t keep track—he just does the next right thing what i said then is just what i’d say again today—except sadly in the past tense but now the wege foundation carries on for peter ‘doing all the good it can’ finally it is my honor to tell you that the foundation trustees have invited me to join them on the board so i am not really going anywhere  now my only question is “how did i get so lucky to be named a trustee” all the best ellen in photo ellen satterlee on the right with dr miranda university of michigan’s dean of the school of

numerous tracts of land to nature conservancies gave the national wildlife federation  million to create a national schoolyard habitat program to teach young children about nature more than  million to protect the muskegon river watershed and an estimated  million to buy ecologically sensitive forest in costa rica he gave millions to the university of michigan’s school of natural resources including a  million gift in  for a graduate student fellowship and a professorship in sustainability he gave millions more to michigan state university grand valley state university and other colleges for environmental programs at his urging aquinas college created a degree in sustainable business but wege didn’t limit his giving to environmental causes the many organizations that benefited from his generosity include the grand rapids symphony the grand rapids ballet company the american cancer society saint mary’s health care and countless schools elementary through college in  at the dedication of the new cathedral square center the headquarters of the grand rapids catholic diocese at  s division ave downtown wege stood and pointed across the street to the building at  s division ave “i was born and raised in that third floor  years ago” he said then he stunned the crowd by pledging to give whatever was needed to complete the  million project a promise that could have totaled close to  million on that day despite all of that he tended to keep a lower profile than some of the area’s other philanthropists he preferred to keep his personal life private including the fact that he was married and divorced seven times he had a sensitive literary side as seen in his poems many drawn from nature if mankind could only realize that we all are a small part of the whole and we fit in the overall plan like a glove fits the hand he professed that his personal wealth was only as good as what it could accomplish a sentiment he learned from his father who “felt that the accumulation of wealth was not in the interest of anybody” mr wege said in a  interview “when you had enough for your retirement you certainly should be generous with the community” some years ago he made it clear he planned to leave his entire estate to his foundation so it could continue functioning after his death “i’m going to give away a lot” he once said “and there will be a lot left over” despite his advancing age he continued running his foundation well into his s he once said he wanted the foundation’s board composed mainly of his children to become more active in the decision making but it soon became clear he wasn’t interested in relinquishing control “it was obvious that wasn’t what he wanted” his oldest son peter martin wege ii once said “all we do is say ‘great job dad keep it up’ he keeps saying he’s going to retire but he never does we don’t believe him anyway this is what keeps him alive and keeps him going” but age eventually forced him to slow down in  he considered moving the foundation offices to a farmhouse he had restored near lowell but decided it would be better given his age if he kept it in his rambling east grand rapids home overlooking reeds lake that same year he was hospitalized briefly due to an irregular heartbeat still he kept the foundation’s small staff busy leaving them stacks of material to read when they arrived at the office each morning assigning them projects to look into almost as if he was driven to make a difference before he died terri mccarthy the foundation’s vice president in charge of programs once told him “if you stopped today you could look back and say ‘i don’t need to do one more thing’” mr wege responded “oh my goodness i still have so much to do” wege is survived by seven children mary goodwillie nelson susan carter peter martin wege ii christopher henry wege diana wege sherogan johanna osman jonathan michael wege he also is survived by  grandchildren and  greatgrandchildren pat shellenbarger contributed
