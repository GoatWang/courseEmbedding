of not having to visit walgreens becaue you cant buy a pass from the stations any longer and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent i save my biggest issue is the commuter benefits card cbc that i used with uber right away people at work noticed something different about their ubers the ubers with the cbc card were older models usually vans once i got my card i also immediately noticed a difference in service as well the people were usually not all but  very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all my final straw came when for a week when i would order a cbc uber and the eta would be    minutes over and over again  yet when i ordered it to my personal credit card  minutes away its not worth what small percentage i save pretax if i have to wait  min to get a older poorly driver uber to get to work i canceled the cbc i work for a university in the northeastern region my university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this january at that time i had around  pretax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this i was mailed a credit card first and was told that i can use it to charge my charlie card i am in boston but i was never able to use their creditcard so i called wage works and that when the nightmare started in april  i called them and inquired how i can get my  back a man on the customer service team said that he could not load the  onto their own credit card but could load  onto a charlie card for june i must wait till june  to use it and the money will not expire then i got the card since i still have a couple of other charlies cards i did not start using it until yesterday june  when i was told that the charlie card will expire tomorrow on june  i spoke with the charlie card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass not a charlie card loaded with credits at all i called them again this morning they did not seem to know anything they are talking about after asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor i was told that the guy in april gave me the wrong information that the  was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month no one told me about the expiration at all whats worse they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card but there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining  minus my ride yesterday in addition the july order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for july and unable to put it onto my credit card to sum up because of their lies i spent  taking a freaking subway ride of  stops in june they lied about the creditcards ability to carry on credit they lied about the monthly passs expiration date and they refused to make it right i am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism they should be fired dr prescription for overthecounter drugsmedicine cough medicine joke app is confusing paymeback is actually under healthcare claim confusing customer service overall nice but automated talkdialogue heavy accents at times cheaper hbs i only am staying w this because i have to employer uses them other than thatstay away customer service representatives seem like they dont know much about the company or its policies so if you wanna do your election and itll be with them u better make sure u wont mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that youre just gonna get stressed out even more for they dont give accurate information unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already they need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful avoid at all costs so hard to work with endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand they try really hard to not talk to you ie i called and they told them someone from hr can only talk to them about my commuter benefits hr calls and told me they can only talk to me make up your damn mind waste of time and they lost all the money i contributed to my commuter benefits this is one of the very worst vendors i have ever worked with in all my years in the corporatework world they have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide it is welldeserved wageworks has a faulty system and their customer service reps do not speak the truth they dont lie on purpose its just that they are woefully illinformed the ww system confirms an order then cancels it the following day before it was canceled i confirmed with two separate reps that i was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits when you call to get confirmation from a customer rep then from a supervisor they say they cannot help you when you ask to speak to the supes manager you cannot why they dont take calls it is a broken system filled with redtape flaws and contradictory errors i hate wageworks poorly trained buffoons ive been trying to get them to roll over my hsa balance for half a year every time i speak to them they tell me i need to speak to the bank who then tells me i need to speak to wageworks the bank transfers me to wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time i mail the form in then nothing happens arrrgghhhhh meanwhile im being charged monthly fees which i assume is why theyre so reluctant to roll my balance over stay away from these idiots as you cant really email support on line i guess yelp is the next best option i had an fsa account that i was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it i never submitted every month for these payments but they came in the customer support person didnt speak english very well and couldnt get her head around my issue the online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something for the love of god please update your customer support to include email thomas worst customer service of any company ive worked with except possibly comcast i had a smartcard type transit pass that was issued by wageworks via payroll deduction it fell out of my pocket and i needed to get a replacement when you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a  fee but i couldnt walk into the transit customer service office and pay the  fee myself because the card was registered to wageworks and not only would wageworks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media they told me it was too late to prevent my next months  pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the th of the month ive had far better customer service from the irs i have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be  technology is less than par  the online user interface appears very simple and maybe idiotproof at first but you soon realize it is too simplistic confusing and clunky i had trouble advancing to the next screen when i tried to stop my commuter card deductions only to have to call their help line and even here i had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computergenerated voice let me through  there is no email option or chat box  i have a feeling like other reviewers here most peoples times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer i dont understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time  customer service quality  is very minimal and not very friendly to users everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching not ready for prime time often fails for example login for new device asks where i want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice  hence unable to move past step  to access my account many similar fails wage works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums they are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements  jeopardize employees continuation of benefits the level of customer service they provide is subpar perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care fsas and my commuter benefit claims can be filed online and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit for transit i have a debit card linked up to my clipper card and it always works well update since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better so i am upgrading them to  stars wageworks you suck  your cobra department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate your so called lead aaron  side was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasnt even his real name your system is outdated and wont auto take payments out you wont contact health providers to instate cobra ins when a problem occurs i was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasnt contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the email again a few days later again and a few

if email is not working then fax them oh no we cant do that so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email thats not working if you run a company stay away from this place people hate it read the reviews and i haven even gotten to the commuter cards this is what epic company failures are  i have an account with wageworks i could not login and called customer service they are a bunch of idiots they can see my account but could not help me why not i think they have a call center somewhere overseas horrible company i am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card oh and they asked me not to contact hr kinda shady this is the absolute worse company i have ever encountered if your an hr manager please stay away from these amateurs i wonder if the wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp maybe they just dont care customer service is very poor language barriers lack of documentation about previous contacts and overall incompetence equates to wageworks rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them i decided to forego reimbursement they will wear you down  im starting to feel less stress already now that i have decided to cut my losses in theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation wageworks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who dont speak english well reading from scripts if you dont have a common issue they wont be able to help they dont understand what you are saying because it isnt in the script so sad shame on you wageworks im writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family i have consistently paid my premiums on time they claim i underpaid the premiums i never received any documentation stating a change in premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage when i initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within  business days and that i didnt have to be concerned about termination of coverage follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage and that i was in good standing suddenly i get an email saying that my coverage is terminated wageworks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications they gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that i received no notifications until it was too late the only remedy theyve offered is to file an appeal which will take  days with no guarantee of reinstatement now im left with zero health care coverage and im left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market i will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by wageworks and recommend they do not use them as a vendor i also plan to yelp and tweet about this their customer service is horrendous my company switched to wageworks for transportation benefits in june with the first monthly train ticket coming from wageworks for july first of all i had major issues setting up my account when i put in my info to set up the account it kept taking me to an account id had with wageworks   yes   years earlier at another employer that employer no longer even uses wageworks it took multiple frustrating calls to wageworks to get that resolved essentially i ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name what kind of company cant close the old account after  years or merge the two accounts so that i could use the preferred version of my name then i gave notice in mid june that i would be leaving my employer unfortunately it was after processing my no longer needed july ticket had started i tried to contact wageworks to stop and once again ran into the fact i have two wageworks accounts it was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor my hr department couldnt resolve the issue so i was told by hr to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back i mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance weeks later i got a response from wageworks that they couldnt accept the letter and i had to use their refund request form i then submitted the refund request form and my request was denied on the grounds that i had had the use of the july ticket for the month of july for the month of july my ticket was sitting on someones desk at wageworks the  number is next to worthless ive finally given up on getting the ticket refunded i dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses wageworks because ill probably end up with three accounts my employer uses wageworks for commuter benefits and fsa benefits for employees i am leaving my job to move to a new city in august so i canceled my commuter benefits in june i called wageworks customer service team twice on the day that i canceled my benefits in order to confirm that i wouldnt have a paycheck deduction in july for use in august two independent customer service representatives assured me that i would have no deduction for my july paycheck this morning i noticed that there was a deduction on my july paycheck from wageworks i called their customer service department again and explained that i had been informed that i would have no deduction for july and that i would like a refund they had a record that i had been informed that i would not have a deduction but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund when i escalated the issue they informed me that it would take  business days to even contact me about the escalation let alone to resolve the issue obviously because most of us have our services from wageworks offered through our employers it is impossible for us to discontinue using them i believe that wageworks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services i am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue and wageworks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called i hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers but its hard for me to draw any other conclusion hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using wageworks for people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations it is devastating to have an unexpected uncontrolled and irreversible charge it is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative misinformed and unhelpful customer service personnel wageworks claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a

experienced the exact same issue and wageworks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called i hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers but its hard for me to draw any other conclusion hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using wageworks for people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations it is devastating to have an unexpected uncontrolled and irreversible charge it is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative

quite like my automatic caltrain pass thats taken out of my paycheck its nice the money is taken out pretax but honestly the convience of not having to visit walgreens becaue you cant buy a pass from the stations any longer and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent i save my biggest issue is the commuter benefits card cbc that i used with uber right away people at work noticed something different about their ubers the ubers with the cbc card were older models usually vans once i got my card i also immediately noticed a difference in service as well the people were usually not all but  very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all my final straw came when for a week when i would order a cbc uber and the eta would be    minutes over and over again  yet when i ordered it to my personal credit card  minutes away its not worth what small percentage i save pretax if i have to wait  min to get a older poorly driver uber to get to work i canceled the cbc i work for a university in the northeastern region my university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this january at that time i had around  pretax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this i was mailed a credit card first and was told that i can use it to charge my charlie card i am in boston but i was never able to use their creditcard so i called wage works and that when the nightmare started in april  i called them and inquired how i can get my  back a man on the customer service team said that he could not load the  onto their own credit card but could load  onto a charlie card for june i must wait till june  to use it and the money will not expire then i got the card since i still have a couple of other charlies cards i did not start using it until yesterday june  when i was told that the charlie card will expire tomorrow on june  i spoke with the charlie card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass not a charlie card loaded with credits at all i called them again this morning they did not seem to know anything they are talking about after asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor i was told that the guy in april gave me the wrong information that the  was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month no one told me about the expiration at all whats worse they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card but there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining  minus my ride yesterday in addition the july order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for july and unable to put it onto my credit card to sum up because of their lies i spent  taking a freaking subway ride of  stops in june they lied about the creditcards ability to carry on credit they lied about the monthly passs expiration date and they refused to make it right i am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism they should be fired dr prescription for overthecounter drugsmedicine cough medicine joke app is confusing paymeback is actually under healthcare claim confusing customer service overall nice but automated talkdialogue heavy accents at times cheaper hbs i only am staying w this because i have to employer uses them other than thatstay away customer service representatives seem like they dont know much about the company or its policies so if you wanna do your election and itll be with them u better make sure u wont mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that youre just gonna get stressed out even more for they dont give accurate information unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already they need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful avoid at all costs so hard to work with endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand they try really hard to not talk to you ie i called and they told them someone from hr can only talk to them about my commuter benefits hr calls and told me they can only talk to me make up your damn mind waste of time and they lost all the money i contributed to my commuter benefits this is one of the very worst vendors i have ever worked with in all my years in the corporatework world they have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide it is welldeserved wageworks has a faulty system and their customer service reps do not speak the truth they dont lie on purpose its just that they are woefully illinformed the ww system confirms an order then cancels it the following day before it was canceled i confirmed with two separate reps that i was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits when you call to get confirmation from a customer rep then from a supervisor they say they cannot help you when you ask to speak to the supes manager you cannot why they dont take calls it is a broken system filled with redtape flaws and contradictory errors i hate wageworks poorly trained buffoons ive been trying to get them to roll over my hsa balance for half a year every time i speak to them they tell me i need to speak to the bank who then tells me i need to speak to wageworks the bank transfers me to wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time i mail the form in then nothing happens arrrgghhhhh meanwhile im being charged monthly fees which i assume is why theyre so reluctant to roll my balance over stay away from these idiots as you cant really email support on line i guess yelp is the next best option i had an fsa account that i was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it i never submitted every month for these payments but they came in the customer support person didnt speak english very well and couldnt get her head around my issue the online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something for the love of god please update your customer support to include email thomas worst customer service of any company ive worked with except possibly comcast i had a smartcard type transit pass that was issued by wageworks via payroll deduction it fell out of my pocket and i needed to get a replacement when you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a  fee but i couldnt walk into the transit customer service office and pay the  fee myself because the card was registered to wageworks and not only would wageworks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media they told me it was too late to prevent my next months  pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the th of the month ive had far better customer service from the irs i have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be  technology is less than par  the online user interface appears very simple and maybe idiotproof at first but you soon realize it is too simplistic confusing and clunky i had trouble advancing to the next screen when i tried to stop my commuter card deductions only to have to call their help line and even here i had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computergenerated voice let me through  there is no email option or chat box  i have a feeling like other reviewers here most peoples times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer i dont understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time  customer service quality  is very minimal and not very friendly to users everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching not ready for prime time often fails for example login for new device asks where i want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice  hence unable to move past step  to access my account many similar fails wage works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums they are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements  jeopardize employees continuation of benefits the level of customer service they provide is subpar perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care fsas and my commuter benefit claims can be filed online and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit for transit i have a debit card linked up to my clipper card and it always works well update since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better so i am upgrading them to  stars wageworks you suck  your cobra department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate your so called lead aaron  side was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasnt even his real name your system is outdated and wont auto take payments out you wont contact health providers to instate cobra ins when a problem occurs i was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasnt contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the email again a few days later again and a few days later again the health provider states we never got it so instead of wasting my time you would think wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up nope or wait if email is not working then fax them oh no we cant do that so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email thats not working if you run a company stay away from this place people hate it read the reviews and i haven even gotten to the commuter cards this is what epic company failures are  i have an account with wageworks i could not login and called customer service they are a bunch of idiots they can see my account but could not help me why not i think they have a call center somewhere overseas horrible company i am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card oh and they asked me not to contact hr kinda shady this is the absolute worse company i have ever encountered if your an hr manager please stay away from these amateurs i wonder if the wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp maybe they just dont care customer service is very poor language barriers lack of documentation about previous contacts and overall incompetence equates to wageworks rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them i decided to forego reimbursement they will wear you down  im starting to feel less stress already now that i have decided to cut my losses in theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation wageworks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who dont speak english well reading from scripts if you dont have a common issue they wont be able to help they dont understand what you are saying because it isnt in the script so sad shame on you wageworks im writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family i have consistently paid my premiums on time they claim i underpaid the premiums i never received any documentation stating a change in premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage when i initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within  business days and that i didnt have to be concerned about termination of coverage follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage and that i was in good standing suddenly i get an email saying that my coverage is terminated wageworks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications they gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that i received no notifications until it was too late the only remedy theyve offered is to file an appeal which will take  days with no guarantee of reinstatement now im left with zero health care coverage and im left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market i will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by wageworks and recommend they do not use them as a vendor i also plan to yelp and tweet about this their customer service is horrendous my company switched to wageworks for transportation benefits in june with the first monthly train ticket coming from wageworks for july first of all i had major issues setting up my account when i put in my info to set up the account it kept taking me to an account id had with wageworks   yes   years earlier at another employer that employer no longer even uses wageworks it took multiple frustrating calls to wageworks to get that resolved essentially i ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name what kind of company cant close the old account after  years or merge the two accounts so that i could use the preferred version of my name then i gave notice in mid june that i would be leaving my employer unfortunately it was after processing my no longer needed july ticket had started i tried to contact wageworks to stop and once again ran into the fact i have two wageworks accounts it was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor my hr department couldnt resolve the issue so i was told by hr to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back i mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance weeks later i got a response from wageworks that they couldnt accept the letter and i had to use their refund request form i then submitted the refund request form and my request was denied on the grounds that i had had the use of the july ticket for the month of july for the month of july my ticket was sitting on someones desk at wageworks the  number is next to worthless ive finally given up on getting the ticket refunded i dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses wageworks because ill probably end up with three accounts my employer uses wageworks for commuter benefits and fsa benefits for employees i am leaving my job to move to a new city in august so i canceled my commuter benefits in june i called wageworks customer service team twice on the day that i canceled my benefits in order to confirm that i wouldnt have a paycheck deduction in july for use in august two independent customer service representatives assured me that i would have no deduction for my july paycheck this morning i noticed that there was a deduction on my july paycheck from wageworks i called their customer service department again and explained that i had been informed that i would have no deduction for july and that i would like a refund they had a record that i had been informed that i would not have a deduction but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund when i escalated the issue they informed me that it would take  business days to even contact me about the escalation let alone to resolve the issue obviously because most of us have our services from wageworks offered through our employers it is impossible for us

health expenses but the aggravation wageworks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold was this review … useful  funny cool mrs marisol r houston tx  friends  reviews  photos elite ’ share review

writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family i have consistently paid my premiums on time  they claim i underpaid the premiums  i never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage when i initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within  business days and that i didnt have to be concerned about termination of coverage follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage and that i was in good standing suddenly i get an email saying that my coverage is terminated    wageworks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications they gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that i received no notifications until it was too late  the only remedy theyve offered is to file an appeal which will take  days with no guarantee of reinstatement  now im left with zero health care coverage and im left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market  i will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  wageworks and recommend they do not use them as a vendor i also plan to yelp and tweet about this was this review … useful funny cool on d springfield va  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow on d stop following on d  their customer service is horrendous  my company switched to wageworks for transportation benefits in june with the first monthly train ticket coming from wageworks for july  first of all i had major issues setting up my account when i put in my info to set up the account it kept taking me to an account id had with wageworks   yes   years earlier at another employer  that employer no longer even uses wageworks  it took multiple frustrating calls to wageworks to get that resolved  essentially i ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name  what kind of company cant close the old account after  years or merge the two accounts so that i could use the preferred version of my namethen i gave notice in mid june that i would be leaving my employer  unfortunately it was after processing my no longer needed july ticket had started  i tried to contact wageworks to stop and once again ran into the fact i have two wageworks accounts  it was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor  my hr department couldnt resolve the issue so i was told by hr to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back  i mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance  weeks later i got a response from wageworks that they couldnt accept the letter and i had to use their refund request form  i then submitted the refund request form and my request was denied on the grounds that i had had the use of the july ticket for the month of july  for the month of july my ticket was sitting on someones desk at wageworks the  number is next to worthless  ive finally given up on getting the ticket refunded  i dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses wageworks because ill probably end up with three accounts was this review … useful  funny cool ellen h new york ny  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow ellen h stop following ellen h  my employer uses wageworks for commuter benefits and fsa benefits for employees i am leaving my job to move to a new city in august so i canceled my commuter benefits in june i called wageworks customer service team twice on the day that i canceled my benefits in order to confirm that i wouldnt have a paycheck deduction in july for use in august two independent customer service representatives assured me that i would have no deduction for my july paycheck this morning i noticed that there was a deduction on my july paycheck from wageworks i called their customer service department again and explained that i had been informed that i would have no deduction for july and that i would like a refund they had a record that i had been informed that i would not have a deduction but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund when i escalated the issue they informed me that it would take  business days to even contact me about the escalation let alone to resolve the issue obviously because most of us have our services from wageworks offered through our employers it is impossible for us to discontinue using them i believe that wageworks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services i am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue and wageworks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called i hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers but its hard for me to draw any other conclusion hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using wageworks for people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations it is devastating to have an unexpected uncontrolled and irreversible charge it is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative misinformed and unhelpful customer service personnel was this review … useful  funny

quickly by direct deposit for transit i have a debit card linked up to my clipper card and it always works well i was quite satisfied with the service and all was as expected may be for others their hr should have worked better but i cant complain and all was calculated and worked i think wageworks does a great job for companies in healthcare much better than others i hv had to deal with most importantly their mobile app is awesome and the easiest tech tool ive used just filed my claims all at once at the end of the year so easy so quick the website and the mobile app are great definitely the best fsa and hsa provider ive used across all of my employers thanks wageworks for getting it right getting my claims filed was easypeasy wageworks has an app that allows me to take a picture of my daughters monthly daycare receipts and submit them online i also have direct deposit setup and my reimbursements goes straight to my bank account sweet enrollments are coming up and hopefully that also goes just as smooth we previously used payflex and wageworks has a much better self service web site some of these reviews crack up and all seem to directed towards their customer service guess those folks want to vent and yelp gives them just the means to do so i never had to or needed to talk to customer service and reading some reviews i hope i never have to  my recommendation is to use their online web site or mobile app if you have a smart phone to submit a claim and not call customer service to submit a claim so far so good update since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better so i am upgrading them to  stars wageworks you suck  your cobra department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate your so called lead aaron  side was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasnt even his real name your system is outdated and wont auto take payments out you wont contact health providers to instate cobra ins when a problem occurs i was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasnt contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the email again a few days later again and a few days later again the health provider states we never got it so instead of wasting my time you would think wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up nope or wait if email is not working then fax them oh no we cant do that so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email thats not working if you run a company stay away from this place people hate it read the reviews and i haven even gotten to the commuter cards this is what epic company failures are  so far i have not had a problem with them for my medical spending account but looking at the reviews is worrisome my husband has a msa with another company outsourceone and they have been awful see my review the big excuse is always something about the irs requirements one more reason not to have government in our health care this is just more bureaucracy and busy work this process creates jobs for the unskilled ged types who sut in offices telling us if and how we can use our own money to go to the doctor in the meantime i bet all those irs desk people are getting better benefits than all of us i doubt they have to deal with this type of busy work to pay for care because they probably dont even have a co payment  wage works will oftentimes assign arbitrary service dates to dependent care accounts outside of your plan year resulting in the disallowance of reimbursement claims the bottom line is this  wageworks will take your money and find a way to disallow your claims in the american legal system this is known as theft update  i complained about this problem and after getting a little bit of a runaround wage works reprocessed my claim and released the funds they had improperly withheld without reimbursement still not a big fan of wage works overall because of the headaches of trying to get money out of my account but they do an acceptable job as you cant really email support on line i guess yelp is the next best option i had an fsa account that i was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it i never submitted every month for these payments but they came in the customer support person didnt speak english very well and couldnt get her head around my issue the online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something for the love of god please update your customer support to include email thomas this is a two mainly because i quite like my automatic caltrain pass thats taken out of my paycheck its nice the money is taken out pretax but honestly the convience of not having to visit walgreens becaue you cant buy a pass from the stations any longer and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent i save my biggest issue is the commuter benefits card cbc that i used with uber right away people at work noticed something different about their ubers the ubers with the cbc card were older models usually vans once i got my card i also immediately noticed a difference in service as well the people were usually not all but  very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all my final straw came when for a week when i would order a cbc uber and the eta would be    minutes over and over again  yet when i ordered it to my personal credit card  minutes away its not worth what small percentage i save pretax if i have to wait  min to get a older poorly driver uber to get to work i canceled the cbc i must agree with most people here and i hope the ceo will pay attention to what their customers are saying i went to a well known drug store today to purchase otc pain reliever my wageworks debit card was declined defeating the whole purpose of having the debit card customer service i suspect overseas was not helpful at all the website is not helpful either i was going to rate them  star but gave an additional star for having a decent mobile app i was able to take a snap shot of the receipt and submit the claim from my smart phone i was relieved to find out that my employer is using a different provider next year my employer uses this company for healthcare fsa they are fine when charges to my fsa debit card are blatantly obvious like from a hospital but struggle with anything else i had to waste my time sending in receipts from a dental visit billing dentist was called university of penn dental care network because the irs demands verification of all expenses and we were unable to verify the services gee whiz what exactly do they think a dental care network provides nail polish broadway show tickets ridiculous if anyone there had common sense they would not make me waste my time digging up receipts to verify obvious claims what a pita for me to get access to my own money generally wageworks has been fine as long as the transactions have been within the accepted guidelines i have been able to submit requesting documents with the appropriate documentation to get my claims approved after reading the other reviews i worried about what would happen if i had a transaction that wasnt so straightforward however the  stars is for their horrible customer service line i dont know if their customer service is outsourced but it feels that way the reps cant provide you with any meaningful information and they seem like they read off a script if you ask them anything out of the ordinary they cant provide an answer and they actually seem stumped i felt that my call was a complete waste of time and at the end of it i was so irritated you could do yourself a favor and try to look up the answer online you would have a better chance of finding the answer than talking to the robots at customer service my wife participated with wage works commuter benefits she has her money taken out of her pay check every month and they are suppose to reimbursed her the following month for her monthly parking fees located in downtown she had no issue getting her reimbursements until now this month she went to wage works site to file for her november reimbursement the money is denied by wage works nothing we can do about it we attempted to resolve this issue and we were told we werent going to get the money we are thinking about filing a small claims against wage works give your money to them at your own risk customer service representatives seem like they dont know much about the company or its policies so if you wanna do your election and itll be with them u better make sure u wont mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that youre just gonna get stressed out even more for they dont give accurate information unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already they need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful poorly trained buffoons ive been trying to get them to roll over my hsa balance for half a year every time i speak to them they tell me i need to speak to the bank who then tells me i need to speak to wageworks the bank transfers me to wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time i mail the form in then nothing happens arrrgghhhhh meanwhile im being charged monthly fees which i assume is why theyre so reluctant to roll my balance over stay away from these idiots this is one of the very worst vendors i have ever worked with in all my years in the corporatework world they have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide it is welldeserved wageworks has a faulty system and their customer service reps do not speak the truth they dont lie on purpose its just that they are woefully illinformed the ww system confirms an order then cancels it the following day before it was canceled i confirmed with two separate reps that i was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits when you call to get confirmation from a customer rep then from a supervisor they say they cannot help you when you ask to speak to the supes manager you cannot why they dont take calls it is a broken system filled with redtape flaws and contradictory errors i hate wageworks i work for a university in the northeastern region my university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this january at that time i had around  pretax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this i was mailed a credit card first and was told that i can use it to charge my charlie card i am in boston but i was never able to use their creditcard so i called wage works and that when the nightmare started in april  i called them and inquired how i can get my  back a man on the customer service team said that he could not load the  onto their own credit card but could load  onto a charlie card for june i must wait till june  to use it and the money will not expire then i got the card since i still have a couple of other charlies cards i did not start using it until yesterday june  when i was told that the charlie card will expire tomorrow on june  i spoke with the charlie card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass not a charlie card loaded with credits at all i called them again this morning they did not seem to know anything they are talking about after asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor i was told that the guy in april gave me the wrong information that the  was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month no one told me about the expiration at all whats worse they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card but there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining  minus my ride yesterday in addition the july order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for july and unable to put it onto my credit card to sum up because of their lies i spent  taking a freaking subway ride of  stops in june they lied about the creditcards ability to carry on credit they lied about the monthly passs expiration date and they refused to make it right i am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism they should be fired not ready for prime time often fails for example login for new device asks where i want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice  hence unable to move past step  to access my account many similar fails wage works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums they are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements  jeopardize employees continuation of benefits the level of customer service they provide is subpar wageworks claimed this business has been claimed by the

continuation of benefits the level of customer service they provide is subpar im writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family i have consistently paid my premiums on time they claim i underpaid the premiums i never received any documentation stating a change in premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage when i initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within  business days and that i didnt have to be concerned about termination of coverage follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage and that i was in good standing suddenly i get an email saying that my coverage is terminated wageworks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications they gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that i received no notifications until it was too late the only remedy theyve offered is to file an appeal which will take  days with no guarantee of reinstatement now im left with zero health care coverage and im left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market i will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by wageworks and recommend they do not use them as a vendor i also plan to yelp and tweet about this i have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be  technology is less than par  the online user interface appears very simple and maybe idiotproof at first but you soon realize it is too simplistic confusing and clunky i had trouble advancing to the next screen when i tried to stop my commuter card deductions only to have to call their help line and even here i had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computergenerated voice let me through  there is no email option or chat box  i have a feeling like other reviewers here most peoples times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer i dont understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time  customer service quality  is very minimal and not very friendly to users everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching worst customer service of any company ive worked with except possibly comcast i had a smartcard type transit pass that was issued by wageworks via payroll deduction it fell out of my pocket and i needed to get a replacement when you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a  fee but i couldnt walk into the transit customer service office and pay the  fee myself because the card was registered to wageworks and not only would wageworks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media they told me it was too late to prevent my next months  pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the th of the month ive had far better customer service from the irs dr prescription for overthecounter drugsmedicine cough medicine joke app is confusing paymeback is actually under healthcare claim confusing customer service overall nice but automated talkdialogue heavy accents at times cheaper hbs i only am staying w this because i have to employer uses them other than thatstay away avoid at all costs so hard to work with endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand they try really hard to not talk to you ie i called and they told them someone from hr can only talk to them about my commuter benefits hr calls and told me they can only talk to me make up your damn mind waste of time and they lost all the money i contributed to my commuter benefits commuter service is horrible you will lose more than you save in tax and if you call  chat with customer care they will eat up hours with no output except frustration thieves lairs take your money dont use you lose it really no check issued to me for money not used some just keep money i worked for sounds like a scam in the end wow i think i need a lawyer omg these people are worthless truly worthless they seem to know how to cash checks theyve cashed  of ours but are unable to notify our insurance company that we are cobra covered weve been on way calls with them and anthem to confirm our coverage but wageworks is incapable of following through unbelievable theyve wasted hours of our time i hate this company customer service is very poor language barriers lack of documentation about previous contacts and overall incompetence equates to wageworks rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them i decided to forego reimbursement they will wear you down  im starting to feel less stress already now that i have decided to cut my losses in theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation wageworks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold just the absolute worst customer service ever their commuter card simply doesnt work  even at caltrain and when you call the off is as apparent as ever impossible to get through to an agent once you do its a circus act trying to get reimbursed for anything  they want you to print and mail forms and go through as much bs as possible so that they dont actually have to pay i have an account with wageworks i could not login and called customer service they are a bunch of idiots they can see my account but could not help me why not i think they have a call center somewhere overseas horrible company i am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card oh and they asked me not to contact hr kinda shady this is the absolute worse company i have ever encountered if your an hr manager please stay away from these amateurs i wonder if the wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp maybe they just dont care wageworks should be ashamed of their company management and customer service i have never encountered such high levels of dishonesty and utter incompetence my company uses their employeefunded transit benefits service i work in san francisco so i and most of my coworkers rely heavily on public transit for our daily commutes this means we allocate substantial amounts of our paychecks into our wageworks accounts last week all of our account balances were suddenly  many of us lost hundreds if not thousands of dollars so we were quite concerned i called their customer service line  times the first time i was on hold for  minutes and the woman told me i would be transfered and then proceeded to hang up on me the second time the woman i spoke to could hardly read her scripted replies was extremely rude and condescending and then hung up the third time the man i spoke to told me that the issue was on my companys side and that the money had already been returned to my employer which turned out to be a complete lie upon contacting my corporate benefits manager he informed me that the issue was companywide and they had been struggling with wageworks for over a week they had even lied to him and said the issue had already been resolved when clearly it had not apparently our company is just one of wageworks many clients whose money has still not been returned to make matters worse i emailed wageworks explaining what happened with their customer service line and asking to be contacted directly to solve the issue i received a reply one week later with a generic response requesting me to call their customer service hotline no thanks im not interested in wasting even more of my time it shocks me that this company manages to stay in business i guess all of the money they steal from hardworking people keeps them afloat i will be advising our corporate benefits manager to seek out an honest transit benefits provider for us to use in the future wageworks is a scam just like the other  plus people here i got a rude awakening when i called wageworks to inquire why i cant use their card for my monthly parking pass at caltrain the phone was handled by a flipino with horrible accent and i had to have her repeat everything couple of times she was totally lost too on the process and  minutes later i looked up the information during the hold times and guided her to set me up with reimburse me option god help these short sighted ceos and my low iq countrymen who allow these atrocities to happen by outsourcing jobs outside of the country and cutting corners on services thee absolute worst fsa company i have ever had customer service is useless and dont know nothing it takes  weeks to get reimbursed for a claim after it is approved then you never receive the check and they just keep telling you it is in the mail they have prerecorded scripts that they say to everyone it takes  business and then the next one it takes  business days from another date other than the check issue date then they tell you after the  business days that it takes another  days for them to research  days later still no check for reimbursement the worst and completely unprofessional wageworks claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup rating details tax services edit  opens a popup edit category write a review add photo share  opens a popup bookmark

wageworks should be ashamed of their company management and customer service i have never encountered such high levels of dishonesty and utter incompetence my company uses their employeefunded transit benefits service i work in san francisco so i and most of my coworkers rely heavily on public transit for our daily commutes this means we allocate substantial amounts of our paychecks into our wageworks accounts last week all of our account balances were suddenly  many of us lost hundreds if not thousands of dollars so we were quite concerned i called their customer service line  times the first time i was on hold for  minutes and the woman told me i would be transfered and then proceeded to hang up on me the second time the woman i spoke to could hardly read her scripted replies was extremely rude and condescending and then hung up the third time the man i spoke to told me that the issue was on my companys side and that the money had already been returned to my employer which turned out to be a complete lie upon contacting my corporate benefits manager he informed me that the issue was companywide and they had been struggling with wageworks for over a week they had even lied to him and said the issue had already been resolved when clearly it had not apparently our company is just one of wageworks many clients whose money has still not been returned to make matters worse i emailed wageworks explaining what happened with their customer service line and asking to be contacted directly to solve the issue i received a reply one week later with a generic response requesting me to call their customer service hotline no thanks im not interested in wasting even more of my time it shocks me that this company manages to stay in business i guess all of the money they steal from hardworking people keeps them afloat i will be advising our corporate benefits manager to seek out an honest transit benefits provider for us to use in the future wageworks is a scam

convience of not having to visit walgreens becaue you cant buy a pass from the stations any longer and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent i save my biggest issue is the commuter benefits card cbc that i used with uber right away people at work noticed something different about their ubers the ubers with the cbc card were older models usually vans once i got my card i also immediately noticed a difference in service as well the people were usually not all but  very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all my final straw came when for a week when i would order a cbc uber and the eta would be    minutes over and over again  yet when i ordered it to my personal credit card  minutes away its not worth what small percentage i save pretax if i have to wait  min to get a older poorly driver uber to get to work i canceled the cbc i work for a university in the northeastern region my university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this january at that time i had around  pretax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this i was mailed a credit card first and was told that i can use it to charge my charlie card i am in boston but i was never able to use their creditcard so i called wage works and that when the nightmare started in april  i called them and inquired how i can get my  back a man on the customer service team said that he could not load the  onto their own credit card but could load  onto a charlie card for june i must wait till june  to use it and the money will not expire then i got the card since i still have a couple of other charlies cards i did not start using it until yesterday june  when i was told that the charlie card will expire tomorrow on june  i spoke with the charlie card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass not a charlie card loaded with credits at all i called them again this morning they did not seem to know anything they are talking about after asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor i was told that the guy in april gave me the wrong information that the  was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month no one told me about the expiration at all whats worse they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card but there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining  minus my ride yesterday in addition the july order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for july and unable to put it onto my credit card to sum up because of their lies i spent  taking a freaking subway ride of  stops in june they lied about the creditcards ability to carry on credit they lied about the monthly passs expiration date and they refused to make it right i am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism they should be fired dr prescription for overthecounter drugsmedicine cough medicine joke app is confusing paymeback is actually under healthcare claim confusing customer service overall nice but automated talkdialogue heavy accents at times cheaper hbs i only am staying w this because i have to employer uses them other than thatstay away customer service representatives seem like they dont know much about the company or its policies so if you wanna do your election and itll be with them u better make sure u wont mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that youre just gonna get stressed out even more for they dont give accurate information unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already they need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful avoid at all costs so hard to work with endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand they try really hard to not talk to you ie i called and they told them someone from hr can only talk to them about my commuter benefits hr calls and told me they can only talk to me make up your damn mind waste of time and they lost all the money i contributed to my commuter benefits this is one of the very worst vendors i have ever worked with in all my years in the corporatework world they have a terrible reputation for reasons that are far and wide it is welldeserved wageworks has a faulty system and their customer service reps do not speak the truth they dont lie on purpose its just that they are woefully illinformed the ww system confirms an order then cancels it the following day before it was canceled i confirmed with two separate reps that i was all set in the system to begin receiving benefits when you call to get confirmation from a customer rep then from a supervisor they say they cannot help you when you ask to speak to the supes manager you cannot why they dont take calls it is a broken system filled with redtape flaws and contradictory errors i hate wageworks as you cant really email support on line i guess yelp is the next best option i had an fsa account that i was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it i never submitted every month for these payments but they came in the customer support person didnt speak english very well and couldnt get her head around my issue the online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something for the love of god please update your customer support to include email thomas worst customer service of any company ive worked with except possibly comcast i had a smartcard type transit pass that was issued by wageworks via payroll deduction it fell out of my pocket and i needed to get a replacement when you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a  fee but i couldnt walk into the transit customer service office and pay the  fee myself because the card was registered to wageworks and not only would wageworks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media they told me it was too late to prevent my next months  pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the th of the month ive had far better customer service from the irs i have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be  technology is less than par  the online user interface appears very simple and maybe idiotproof at first but you soon realize it is too simplistic confusing and clunky i had trouble advancing to the next screen when i tried to stop my commuter card deductions only to have to call their help line and even here i had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computergenerated voice let me through  there is no email option or chat box  i have a feeling like other reviewers here most peoples times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer i dont understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time  customer service quality  is very minimal and not very friendly to users everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching not ready for prime time often fails for example login for new device asks where i want to receive the security code but there is nothing on the screen to submit my choice  hence unable to move past step  to access my account many similar fails wage works is incompetent to handle employee benefit premiums they are unable to mail out accurate and timely account statements  jeopardize employees continuation of benefits the level of customer service they provide is subpar perfectly usable for my health care and dependent care fsas and my commuter benefit claims can be filed online and money is sent very quickly by direct deposit for transit i have a debit card linked up to my clipper card and it always works well update since dealing with wageworks for the last year they have gotten better so i am upgrading them to  stars wageworks you suck  your cobra department has now surpassed many of the large companies we have come to hate your so called lead aaron  side was rude and trained to be a talking parrot and guessing that wasnt even his real name your system is outdated and wont auto take payments out you wont contact health providers to instate cobra ins when a problem occurs i was told by a rep that for some reason my health provider wasnt contacted after my payment was processed and they resent the email again a few days later again and a few days later again the health provider states we never got it so instead of wasting my time you would think wageworks would have a department to call the health provider and clear things up nope or wait if email is not working then fax them oh no we cant do that so let us just tell you we will contact them again via email thats not working if you run a company stay away from this place people hate it read the reviews and i haven even gotten to the commuter cards this is what epic company failures are  i have an account with wageworks i could not login and called customer service they are a bunch of idiots they can see my account but could not help me why not i think they have a call center somewhere overseas horrible company i am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card oh and they asked me not to contact hr kinda shady this is the absolute worse company i have ever encountered if your an hr manager please stay away from these amateurs i wonder if the wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp maybe they just dont care customer service is very poor language barriers lack of documentation about previous contacts and overall incompetence equates to wageworks rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them i decided to forego reimbursement they will wear you down  im starting to feel less stress already now that i have decided to cut my losses in theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation wageworks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who dont speak english well reading from scripts if you dont have a common issue they wont be able to help they dont understand what you are saying because it isnt in the script so sad shame on you wageworks im writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family i have consistently paid my premiums on time they claim i underpaid the premiums i never received any documentation stating a change in premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage when i initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within  business days and that i didnt have to be concerned about termination of coverage follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage and that i was in good standing suddenly i get an email saying that my coverage is terminated wageworks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications they gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that i received no notifications until it was too late the only remedy theyve offered is to file an appeal which will take  days with no guarantee of reinstatement now im left with zero health care coverage and im left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market i will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by wageworks and recommend they do not use them as a vendor i also plan to yelp and tweet about this their customer service is horrendous my company switched to wageworks for transportation benefits in june with the first monthly train ticket coming from wageworks for july first of all i had major issues setting up my account when i put in my info to set up the account it kept taking me to an account id had with wageworks   yes   years earlier at another employer that employer no longer even uses wageworks it took multiple frustrating calls to wageworks to get that resolved essentially i ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name what kind of company cant close the old account after  years or merge the two accounts so that i could use the preferred version of my name then i gave notice in mid june that i would be leaving my employer unfortunately it was after processing my no longer needed july ticket had started i tried to contact wageworks to stop and once again ran into the fact i have two wageworks accounts it was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor my hr department couldnt resolve the issue so i was told by hr to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back i mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance weeks later i got a response from wageworks that they couldnt accept the letter and i had to use their refund request form i then submitted the refund request form and my request was denied on the grounds that i had had the use of the july ticket for the month of july for the month of july my ticket was sitting on someones desk at wageworks the  number is next to worthless ive finally given up on getting the ticket refunded i dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses wageworks because ill probably end up with three accounts my employer uses wageworks for commuter benefits and fsa benefits for employees i am leaving my job to move to a new city in august so i canceled my commuter benefits in june i called wageworks customer service team twice on the day that i canceled my benefits in order to confirm that i wouldnt have a paycheck deduction in july for use in august two independent customer service representatives assured me that i would have no deduction for my july paycheck this morning i noticed that there was a deduction on my july paycheck from wageworks i called their customer service department again and explained that i had been informed that i would have no deduction for july and that i would like a refund they had a record that i had been informed that i would not have a deduction but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund when i escalated the issue they informed me that it would take  business days to even contact me about the escalation let alone to resolve the issue obviously because most of us have our services from wageworks offered through our employers it is impossible for us to discontinue using them i believe that wageworks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services i am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue and wageworks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called i hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers but its hard for me to draw any other conclusion hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using wageworks for people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations it is devastating to have an unexpected uncontrolled and irreversible charge it is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative misinformed and unhelpful customer service personnel wageworks claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup rating details tax services edit

embed review compliment send message follow shari e stop following shari e  im writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family i have consistently paid my premiums on time  they claim i underpaid the premiums  i never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage when i initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within  business days and that i didnt have to be concerned about termination of coverage follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage and that i was in good standing suddenly i get an email saying that my coverage is terminated    wageworks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications they gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that i received no notifications until it was too late  the only remedy theyve offered is to file an appeal which will take  days with no guarantee of reinstatement  now im left with zero health care coverage and im left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market  i will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  wageworks and recommend they do not use them as a vendor i also plan to yelp and tweet about this was this review … useful funny cool on d springfield va  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow on d stop following on d  their customer service is horrendous  my company switched to wageworks for transportation benefits in june with the first monthly train ticket coming from wageworks for july  first of all i had major issues setting up my account when i put in my info to set up the account it kept taking me to an account id had with wageworks   yes   years earlier at another employer  that employer no longer even uses wageworks  it took multiple frustrating calls to wageworks to get that resolved  essentially i ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name  what kind of company cant close the old account after  years or merge the two accounts so that i could use the preferred version of my namethen i gave notice in mid june that i would be leaving my employer  unfortunately it was after processing my no longer needed july ticket had started  i tried to contact wageworks to stop and once again ran into the fact i have two wageworks accounts  it was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor  my hr department couldnt resolve the issue so i was told by hr to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back  i mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance  weeks later i got a response from wageworks that they couldnt accept the letter and i had to use their refund request form  i then submitted the refund request form and my request was denied on the grounds that i had had the use of the july ticket for the month of july  for the month of july my ticket was sitting on someones desk at wageworks the  number is next to worthless  ive finally given up on getting the ticket refunded  i dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses wageworks because ill probably end up with three accounts was this review … useful  funny cool ellen h new york ny  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow ellen h stop following ellen h  my employer uses wageworks for commuter benefits and fsa benefits for employees i am leaving my job to move to a new city in august so i canceled my commuter benefits in june i called wageworks customer service team twice on the day that i canceled my benefits in order to confirm that i wouldnt have a paycheck deduction in july for use in august two independent customer service representatives assured me that i would have no deduction for my july paycheck this morning i noticed that there was a deduction on my july paycheck from wageworks i called their customer service department again and explained that i had been informed that i would have no deduction for july and that i would like a refund they had a record that i had been informed that i would not have a deduction but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund when i escalated the issue they informed me that it would take  business days to even contact me about the escalation let alone to resolve the issue obviously because most of us have our services from wageworks offered through our employers it is impossible for us to discontinue using them i believe that wageworks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services i am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue and wageworks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called i hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers but its hard for me to draw any other conclusion hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using wageworks for people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations it is devastating to have an unexpected uncontrolled and irreversible charge it is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative

quite like my automatic caltrain pass thats taken out of my paycheck its nice the money is taken out pretax but honestly the convience of not having to visit walgreens becaue you cant buy a pass from the stations any longer and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent i save my biggest issue is the commuter benefits card cbc that i used with uber right away people at work noticed something different about their ubers the ubers with the cbc card were older models usually vans once i got my card i also immediately noticed a difference in service as well the people were usually not all but  very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all my final straw came when for a week when i would order a cbc uber and the eta would be    minutes over and over again  yet when i ordered it to my personal credit card  minutes away its not worth what small percentage i save pretax if i have to wait  min to get a older poorly driver uber to get to work i canceled the cbc i work for a university in the northeastern region my university contracted this company to do my commuter benefit this january at that time i had around  pretax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this i was mailed a credit card first and was told that i can use it to charge my charlie card i am in boston but i was never able to use their creditcard so i called wage works and that when the nightmare started in april  i called them and inquired how i can get my  back a man on the customer service team said that he could not load the  onto their own credit card but could load  onto a charlie card for june i must wait till june  to use it and the money will not expire then i got the card since i still have a couple of other charlies cards i did not start using it until yesterday june  when i was told that the charlie card will expire tomorrow on june  i spoke with the charlie card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass not a charlie card loaded with credits at all i called them again this morning they did not seem to know anything they are talking about after asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor i was told that the guy in april gave me the wrong information that the  was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month no one told me about the expiration at all whats worse they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card but there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining  minus my ride yesterday in addition the july order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for july and unable to put it onto my credit card to sum up because of their lies i spent  taking a freaking subway ride of  stops in june they lied about the creditcards ability to carry on credit they lied about the monthly passs expiration date and they refused to make it right i am extremely upset by their lack of professionalism they should be fired dr prescription for overthecounter drugsmedicine cough medicine joke app is confusing paymeback is actually under healthcare claim confusing customer service overall nice but automated talkdialogue heavy accents at times cheaper hbs i only am staying w this because i have to employer uses them other than thatstay away customer service representatives seem like they dont know much about the company or its policies so if you wanna do your election and itll be with them u better make sure u wont mess it up yourself coz if u do and u have to call them about this and that youre just gonna get stressed out even more for they dont give accurate information unless you ask for the supervisor and explain whatever situation which is kind of handful already they need to train their people a lot more and into being more knowledgeable and resourceful avoid at all costs so hard to work with endless holds and all the associates on the phone have heavy accents and hard to understand they try really hard to not talk to you ie i called and they told them someone from hr can only talk to them about my commuter benefits hr calls and told me they can only talk to me make up your damn mind waste of time and they lost all the money i contributed to my commuter benefits poorly trained buffoons ive been trying to get them to roll over my hsa balance for half a year every time i speak to them they tell me i need to speak to the bank who then tells me i need to speak to wageworks the bank transfers me to wageworks who then give me a different address to mail the form to than the one they gave me last time i mail the form in then nothing happens arrrgghhhhh meanwhile im being charged monthly fees which i assume is why theyre so reluctant to roll my balance over stay away from these idiots as you cant really email support on line i guess yelp is the next best option i had an fsa account that i was trying to submit for quarterly but ended up getting monthly small sums of money without me realizing it i never submitted every month for these payments but they came in the customer support person didnt speak english very well and couldnt get her head around my issue the online portal seems easy but is not easy when you need to fix something for the love of god please update your customer support to include email thomas worst customer service of any company ive worked with except possibly comcast i had a smartcard type transit pass that was issued by wageworks via payroll deduction it fell out of my pocket and i needed to get a replacement when you have a registered pass that you buy in your own name with your own money the transit system can revoke a lost card and transfer your pass to a new one for a  fee but i couldnt walk into the transit customer service office and pay the  fee myself because the card was registered to wageworks and not only would wageworks not follow the standard replacement process for fare media they told me it was too late to prevent my next months  pass from being loaded onto the lost card because it was after the th of the month ive had far better customer service from the irs i have to say that the service offering from this company is less than satisfactory despite the more progressive image the brand holds itself to be  technology is less than par  the online user interface appears very simple and maybe idiotproof at first but you soon realize it is too simplistic confusing and clunky i had trouble advancing to the next screen when i tried to stop my commuter card deductions only to have to call their help line and even here i had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computergenerated voice let me through  there is no email option or chat box  i have a feeling like other reviewers here most peoples times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer i dont understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time  customer service quality  is very minimal and not very friendly to users everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted answers not very helpful to users and they do not seem to be proud of the service offering of the company that they should be enriching not ready for prime time often fails for example login for new device asks where i want

representatives assured me that i would have no deduction for my july paycheck this morning i noticed that there was a deduction on my july paycheck from wageworks i called their customer service department again and explained that i had been informed that i would have no deduction for july and that i would like a refund they had a record that i had been informed that i would not have a deduction but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund when i escalated the issue they informed me that it would take  business days to even contact me about the escalation let alone to

pretax but honestly the convience of not having to visit walgreens becaue you cant buy a pass from the stations any longer and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent i save my biggest issue is the commuter benefits card cbc that i used with uber right away people at work noticed something different about their ubers the ubers with the cbc card were older models usually vans once i got my card i also immediately noticed a difference in service as well the people were usually not all but  very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at all my final straw came when for a week when i would order a cbc uber and the eta would be    minutes over and over again  yet when i ordered it to my personal credit card  minutes away its not worth what small percentage i save pretax if i have to wait  min to get a older poorly driver uber to get to work i canceled the cbc dr prescription for overthecounter drugsmedicine cough medicine

able to use their creditcard so i called wage works and that when the nightmare startedin april  i called them and inquired how i can get my  back a man on the customer service team said that he could not load the  onto their own credit card but could load  onto a charlie card for june i must wait till june  to use it and the money will not expire then i got the card since i still have a couple of other charlies cards i did not start using it until yesterday june  when i was told that the charlie card will expire tomorrow on june  i spoke with the charlie card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass not a charlie card loaded with credits at alli called them again this morning they did not seem to know anything they are talking about after asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor i was told that the guy in april gave me the wrong information that the  was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month no one told me about

coverage when i initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within  business days and that i didnt have to be concerned about termination of coverage follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage and that i was in good standing suddenly i get an email saying that my coverage is terminated    wageworks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications they gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that i received no notifications until it was too late  the only remedy theyve offered is to file an appeal which will take  days with no guarantee of reinstatement  now im left with zero health care

wageworks for july  first of all i had major issues setting up my account when i put in my info to set up the account it kept taking me to an account id had with wageworks   yes   years earlier at another employer  that employer no longer even uses wageworks  it took multiple frustrating calls to wageworks to get that resolved  essentially i ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name  what kind of company cant close the old account after  years or merge the two accounts so that i could use the preferred version of my namethen i gave notice in mid june that i would be leaving my employer  unfortunately it was after processing my no longer needed july ticket had started  i tried to contact wageworks to stop and once again ran into the fact i have two wageworks accounts  it was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor  my hr department couldnt resolve the issue so i was told by hr to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back  i mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance  weeks later i got a response from wageworks that they couldnt accept the letter and i had to use their refund request form  i then submitted the refund request form and my request was denied on the grounds that i had had the use of the july ticket for the month of july  for the month of july my ticket was sitting on someones desk at wageworks the  number is next to worthless  ive finally given up on getting the ticket refunded  i dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses wageworks because ill probably end up with three accounts was this review … useful  funny cool ellen h new york ny  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow ellen h stop following ellen h  my employer uses wageworks for commuter benefits and fsa benefits for employees i am leaving my job to move to a new city in august so i canceled my commuter benefits in june i called wageworks customer service team twice on the day that i canceled my benefits in order to confirm that i wouldnt have a paycheck deduction in july for use in august two independent customer service representatives assured me that i would have no deduction for my july paycheck this morning i noticed that there was a deduction on my july paycheck from wageworks i called their customer service department again and explained that i had been informed that i would have no deduction for july and that i would like a refund they had a record that i had been informed that i would not have a deduction but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund when i escalated the issue they informed me that it would take  business days to even contact me about the escalation let alone to resolve the issue obviously because most of us have our services from wageworks offered through our employers it is impossible for us to discontinue using them i believe that wageworks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services i am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue and wageworks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called i hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers but its hard for me to draw any other conclusion hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using wageworks for people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations it is devastating to have an unexpected uncontrolled and irreversible charge it is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative misinformed and unhelpful customer service

canceled my commuter benefits in june i called wageworks customer service team twice on the day that i canceled my benefits in order to confirm that i wouldnt have a paycheck deduction in july for use in august two independent customer service representatives assured me that i would have no deduction for my july paycheck this morning i noticed that there was a deduction on my july paycheck from wageworks i called their customer service department again and explained that i had been informed that i would have no deduction for july and that i would like a refund they had a record that i had been informed that i would not have a deduction but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund when i escalated the issue they informed me that it would take  business days to even contact me about the escalation let alone to resolve the issue obviously because most of us have our services from wageworks offered through our employers it is impossible for us to discontinue using them i believe that wageworks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services i am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue and wageworks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called i hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers but its hard for me to draw any other conclusion hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using wageworks for people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations it is devastating to have an unexpected uncontrolled and irreversible charge it is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative misinformed and unhelpful customer service

cool  shari e manhattan ny  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow shari e stop following shari e  im writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service  wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family i have consistently paid my premiums on time  they claim i underpaid the premiums  i never received any documentation stating a change in  premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage when i initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within  business days and that i didnt have to be concerned about termination of coverage follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage and that i was in good standing suddenly i get an email saying that my coverage is terminated    wageworks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications they gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that i received no notifications until it was too late  the only remedy theyve offered is to file an appeal which will take  days with no guarantee of reinstatement  now im left with zero health care coverage and im left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market  i will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by  wageworks and recommend they do not use them as a vendor i also plan to yelp and tweet about this was

frustrating calls to wageworks to get that resolved  essentially i ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name  what kind of company cant close the old account after  years or merge the two accounts so that i could use the preferred version of my namethen i gave notice in mid june that i would be leaving my employer  unfortunately it was after processing my no longer needed july ticket had started  i tried to contact wageworks to stop and once again ran into the fact i have two wageworks accounts  it was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor  my hr department couldnt resolve the issue so i was told by hr to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back  i mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance  weeks later i got a response from wageworks that they couldnt accept the letter and i had to use their refund request form  i then submitted the refund request form

help me why not i think they have a call center somewhere overseas horrible company i am now stuck with the wrong commuter value in my card oh and they asked me not to contact hr kinda shady this is the absolute worse company i have ever encountered if your an hr manager please stay away from these amateurs i wonder if the wageworks management is even aware of all bad reviews here in yelp maybe they just dont care customer service is very poor language barriers lack of documentation about previous contacts and overall incompetence equates to wageworks rather than spend additional hours of aggravation interacting with them i decided to forego reimbursement they will wear you down  im starting to feel less stress already now that i have decided to cut my losses in theory you can save a few dollars in taxes related to health expenses but the aggravation wageworks inflicts will negate any savings ten fold nightmare company ever since they moved their operation overseas their once stellar customer service is now just a bunch of people who dont speak english well reading from scripts if you dont have a common issue they wont be able to help they dont understand what you are saying because it isnt in the script so sad shame on you wageworks im writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with wageworks customer service wageworks has unjustifiably cancelled my cobra insurance coverage for me and my family i have consistently paid my premiums on time they claim i underpaid the premiums i never received any documentation stating a change in premium amounts until they notified me of the termination of coverage when i initially called to inquire about the claim of underpayment the representatives told me that they mistakenly misappropriated the premium funds and would rectify the situation within  business days and that i didnt have to be concerned about termination of coverage follow up calls revealed that there was no shortage and that i was in good standing suddenly i get an email saying that my coverage is terminated wageworks has refused to accept responsibility for any miscommunications they gave me contradictory and confusing information and make no allowances for the fact that i received no notifications until it was too late the only remedy theyve offered is to file an appeal which will take  days with no guarantee of reinstatement now im left with zero health care coverage and im left devastated and vulnerable in this current healthcare market i will speak to any benefits manager in my future advising them of the poor customer service provided by wageworks and recommend they do not use them as a vendor i also plan to yelp and tweet about this their customer service is horrendous my company switched to wageworks for transportation benefits in june with the first monthly train ticket coming from wageworks for july first of all i had major issues setting up my account when i put in my info to set up the account it kept taking me to an account id had with wageworks   yes   years earlier at another employer that employer no longer even uses wageworks it took multiple frustrating calls to wageworks to get that resolved essentially i ended up with two accounts under different versions of my name what kind of company cant close the old account after  years or merge the two accounts so that i could use the preferred version of my name then i gave notice in mid june that i would be leaving my employer unfortunately it was after processing my no longer needed july ticket had started i tried to contact wageworks to stop and once again ran into the fact i have two wageworks accounts it was an endless round of being on hold and being hung up on as they tried to escalate my case to a supervisor my hr department couldnt resolve the issue so i was told by hr to wait for the new ticket to be delivered and then mail it back i mailed the ticket back along with a letter explaining the circumstance weeks later i got a response from wageworks that they couldnt accept the letter and i had to use their refund request form i then submitted the refund request form and my request was denied on the grounds that i had had the use of the july ticket for the month of july for the month of july my ticket was sitting on someones desk at wageworks the  number is next to worthless ive finally given up on getting the ticket refunded i dread changing jobs again and finding out that a new employer uses wageworks because ill probably end up with three accounts my employer uses wageworks for commuter benefits and fsa benefits for employees i am leaving my job to move to a new city in august so i canceled my commuter benefits in june i called wageworks customer service team twice on the day that i canceled my benefits in order to confirm that i wouldnt have a paycheck deduction in july for use in august two independent customer service representatives assured me that i would have no deduction for my july paycheck this morning i noticed that there was a deduction on my july paycheck from wageworks i called their customer service department again and explained that i had been informed that i would have no deduction for july and that i would like a refund they had a record that i had been informed that i would not have a deduction but they were unable and unwilling to issue a refund when i escalated the issue they informed me that it would take  business days to even contact me about the escalation let alone to resolve the issue obviously because most of us have our services from wageworks offered through our employers it is impossible for us to discontinue using them i believe that wageworks profits off of knowing that we have almost no power to stop using their services i am not the only employee at my company who has experienced the exact same issue and wageworks has been similarly obstinate and unhelpful for every one of them who called i hesitate to claim that they are intentionally instructing their employees to misinform their customers but its hard for me to draw any other conclusion hopefully this review will encourage an employer somewhere to think twice before using wageworks for people who budget carefully and factor each expense into their calculations it is devastating to have an unexpected uncontrolled and irreversible charge it is additionally frustrating to be met with uncooperative misinformed and unhelpful customer service personnel wageworks claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews

follow meg t stop following meg t  this is a two mainly because i quite like my automatic caltrain pass thats taken out of my paycheckits nice the money is taken out pretax but honestly the convience of not having to visit walgreens becaue you cant buy a pass from the stations any longer and wait in line is worth more to me than whatever percent i savemy biggest issue is the commuter benefits card cbc that i used with uber right away people at work noticed something different about their ubers the ubers with the cbc card were older models usually vans once i got my card i also immediately noticed a difference in service as well the people were usually not all but  very poor drivers and the app would spin and spin sometimes taking a full minute to find a driver at allmy final straw came when for a week when i would order a cbc uber and the eta would be    minutes over and over again  yet when i ordered it to my personal credit card  minutes awayits not worth what small percentage i save pretax if i have to wait  min to get a older poorly driver uber to get to work i canceled the cbc was this review … useful  funny  cool  amy l boston ma  friends  reviews share review embed

that time i had around  pretax deduction from my account from the previous company that handles this i was mailed a credit card first and was told that i can use it to charge my charlie card i am in boston but i was never able to use their creditcard so i called wage works and that when the nightmare startedin april  i called them and inquired how i can get my  back a man on the customer service team said that he could not load the  onto their own credit card but could load  onto a charlie card for june i must wait till june  to use it and the money will not expire then i got the card since i still have a couple of other charlies cards i did not start using it until yesterday june  when i was told that the charlie card will expire tomorrow on june  i spoke with the charlie card office and was told that it was actually a monthly pass not a charlie card loaded with credits at alli called them again this morning they did not seem to know anything they are talking about after asking them to forward my call to the customer support supervisor i was told that the guy in april gave me the wrong information that the  was actually for a monthly pass and must be used by the end of the month no one told me about the expiration at allwhats worse they said that the creditcard was actually working and that he should have sent the money to the credit card but there was nothing they could do to give me back the remaining  minus my ride yesterday in addition the july order is in and they gave me another monthly pass for july and unable to put it onto my credit card to sum up because of

when i tried to stop my commuter card deductions only to have to call their help line  and even here i had to dial my social digits and zip code three times before the computergenerated voice let me through there is no email option or chat box  i have a feeling like other reviewers here most peoples times are limited and they do not want to use their time and energy to have to call and wait and wait for them to look up the answer  i dont understand why they do not offer an email or chat function that could help minimize time spent on resolving admin problems that cut into my work and personal time customer service quality  is very minimal and not very friendly to users  everything seems to be outsourced and the customer service people are trained to provide very rote and scripted
