how it works — technicians for sustainability how it works from your rooftop to your outlets explained  solar panels powering your home with the sun starts here typically mounted onto your roof solar panels are made up of photovoltaic or pv cells which convert sunlight into direct current dc electricity solar panels can also be integrated into other structures such as carports ramadas fixed ground mounts and trackers inverter solar panels create dc electricity which the inverter then converts to ac electricity which is used in homes solar meter the solar meter measures how much electricity your pv system produces ac disconnect this enables electricians to disconnect the building’s electrical system from the solar electricity system by switching the ac disconnect off workers can safely perform system maintenance electric panel ac electricity from your inverter is passed onto the electric service panel where it is routed to power your home’s various electric loads net meter through a process called net metering when your solar system produces more power than you use a net meter provided by the utility company records the amount of electricity being sent back to the grid for which you receive credit and how much electricity you are receiving from the utility as you use more electricity you will first use up any credits that you have before paying for additional electricity a closer look  utility grid gridtied solar photovoltaic systems interface seamlessly with the utility grid which allows the utility to serve as the backup power for your building rather than storing excess electricity in batteries during the day your pv system will first power any electric loads in your building before sending any excess generation back to the utility grid at night you’ll draw from the utility grid essentially using the electrical grid as a giant storage batteryperformance performance monitoring allows both you and tfs to monitor your solar electric pv system remotely via

local first march   sustainability tucson  southern arizona for many the concept of sustainability places most of its focus on the environment in actuality it encompasses much more than being good to the planet from social equity to economic sustainability to creating a product or service that benefits the community technicians for sustainability is a tucson solar installation company that engages in many different facets of sustainability which i found out with a visit to their workplace i was excited to venture out of phoenix and conduct my first interview with a locally owned business as i approached technicians for sustainabilitys office i noticed a lack of vehicles at a place where there was at least  employees inside their building feels more like a home than an office where the company’s employees buzzed with greetings and productive conversation in the back of the house the installers were hard at work collecting their tools and items for the day’s work  popping in and out to greet those in the office it was obvious to me that this was a place that people liked to be from the employees to the owners to the installers technicians for sustainability’s mission is multifaceted as a for profit business they sell and install highquality clean solar electric and solar hot water systems that are built to last they have an intriguing sales model as they do not try to sell their product but instead take much more value in educating potential customers and youth about the benefits of solar energy one of their programs has their employees travel to local schools from preschool to college to engage students in handson projects displaying how solar power can positively impact daily life in all aspects from environmental improvements to economic improvements the education process doesn’t stop at educating students though tfs’ owners nicole and kevin koch pursue an education for their staff as well while they see value in staff bonding events they want to give more to their staff than awards and fun they practice openbook management meaning any of their employees are welcome to learn more about the financials of the business this not only provides transparency between owners and employees but teaches the employees financial literacy they also focus on creating a vibrant corporate culture with their employees in the fore front their hiring process is primarily grassroots as they hire on recommendation and are drawn to people who have an interest in social sustainability tfs encourages alternative transportation among their staff by encouraging their team to commute via bicycle i heard a plethora of biking stories including a staff member who lost a significant amount of weight and an employee who sold her car and began riding her bike  miles a day not due to pressure but due to an adoption of culture that exists within the company tfs also practices environmental sustainability in the traditional sense when working on an installation they use modified electric bikes to get solar panels to work sites throughout the city for locations that are too far for electric bike they use electric cars and hybrids along with  fuel efficient trucks for more arduous trips they recycle glass paper plastics and a large number of wooden pallets used for solar panel shipping the pallets get reused by a local furniture store that transforms them into home furnishings as i left tucson i pondered the choice of technicians for sustainability as the company’s name certainly they could incorporate the word “solar” or “alternative energies” in there somewhere after sitting down with this incredible group i understand why solar power installation is a service and a product yet this company is at the helm of something much greater they exude sustainability in all they do from education to company transparency to being a certified b corporation to coming up with outsidethebox methods to provide a fun and ecominded culture technicians for sustainability is a fantastic example of what can be done by incorporating sustainability into your business on a variety of levels search the news blog browse news by topic
