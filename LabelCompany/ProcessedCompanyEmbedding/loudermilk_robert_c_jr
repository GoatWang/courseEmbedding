years and a billion dollars later  email  print  feed fifty years and a billion dollars later susan percy aaron rents inc founded by atlanta native r charles loudermilk sr in  with a  bank loan passed the billiondollar mark last year the company which leases furniture and appliances went public in  and began a successful franchise program in  loudermilk is chairman and ceo of the company his son robert c robin loudermilk jr is president and chief operating officer charlie loudermilk has been a pillar of atlantas civic community for decades he has given several million dollars to charitable endeavors and educational institutions including his alma mater the university of north carolina he is founder and past chairman of the buckhead coalition and has been on the boards of the piedmont hospital foundation the atlanta community food bank and the lovett school he was a member of the group that built the omni in atlanta and once owned the atlanta hawks and the flames loudermilk talked to editor susan percy in his buckhead office following are highlights from the interview gt what does it take to be successful in business for  years loudermilk i think the number one thing is people skills youve got to love the people and in turn they love you theres just so much one person can do weve got a tremendous team here gt aaron rents really isnt just a rental company anymore is it how would you describe it loudermilk we have invented through the years a new hybrid a way to get home necessities to people about half of them are creditconstrained the other half  they like the idea of renting to see if they like the product or to have the ability to turn it back any time they want to but were not the weeklypay chasethemeverysaturdaynight renttoown operation we say were sales and lease ownership its a simple program in that somebody comes in and leases an item for a month they can send it back at the end of the month or they can pay another months rent if they pay  months generally its theirs we dont charge a security deposit we dont charge a delivery or pickup fee its really just a new mousetrap a way of getting household products to the consumer were growing at the rate of about  percent a year i dont know another large chain operator thats growing at  percent a year last year we surpassed the billion mark  top line bottom line we were about  million before tax its a big machine moving very fast right now gt what are the top rental items loudermilk the number one item is a bigscreen television we have probably  to  of them out to rent the number two item to rent is a computer  were a very large dell distributor gt did you really get started in business by renting out  folding chairs or is that just a story loudermilk oh no its very true  i rented them for  cents a day per chair to an auction out here on west paces ferry gt how did the company grow from that point loudermilk then we had tables and china and silver and chafing dishes and candelabras everything for a party we dealt primarily with caterers then we went into hospital equipment  wheelchairs and beds and so forth we were a big player in that but then i heard about furniture rental and started researching it we bought  groups of furniture  living room bedroom dining room gt and at some point you got into manufacturing loudermilk back when lockheed was gearing up for the big ca airplane production they brought engineers in from all over the world and we were renting the furniture for these people we couldnt get the furniture so i decided to go into manufacturing i want to always control as many things in my life as i possibly can this year we will manufacture over  million worth of furniture all used in our stores we sell to no one outside the aaron community gt what prompted you to take the company public loudermilk you wont believe this but im a quail hunter a group of us for years leased land to hunt on in south georgia rankin smith was one of our group and he bought a place down in thomasville i decided i would really love to have a hunting place the only way i could afford to do that was to go public as we were growing we were eating up all the internal funds and all we could borrow to promote the company and to grow there was just no cash left for me to buy a toy its called woodhaven plantation its  acres gt so going public was a good decision loudermilk we went public  years ago if someone had invested  it would be worth over  today gt is there anything in particular that has helped you in your career loudermilk ive been very healthy if id had bad health i couldnt have grown this business gt youre known for your philanthropy with all the worthy causes out there how do you decide which ones to support loudermilk one day i counted i had eight solicitations for funds you have to really look at each one ninety percent of them are very worthy personally ive taken a position that i want to give bricks and mortar ive given to chapel hill and to a hospital down in thomasville  archbold to lovett school to piedmont college to a building downtown  the united way building my feeling is that you provide the facility and its up to the operators to make something out of it the only way i broke with that was that i gave georgia state half a million for the andrew young school gt how did you come to donate money for the baseball complex at piedmont college loudermilk my dad was raised in demorest he played baseball there one of the famous names of baseball is demorests johnny mize and johnny mizes mother was a loudermilk johnny mize and my father were cousins i used to go up there in the summertime and visit my grandfather gt werent you involved in andrew youngs campaign for mayor loudermilk i was cochairman of the campaign that was an unusual time in my life  me being a conservative white republican and young a black liberal democrat but andy and i have been close friends for years back he was the right man at the right time for that job i think he did a fabulous job for eight years as mayor the great things that shirley franklin is doing today  a lot of them she learned from andrew young and thats a compliment to them both im very high on what shirleys doing and shirley herself and how shes approaching things gt did your work with andrew young surprise any of your business associates loudermilk it was not a real popular thing in the white business community for me to support andy gt its been pretty well accepted that to be successful in atlanta in business you have to become involved in the community is that changing loudermilk i think it is changing dramatically to the detriment of atlanta i have a real concern now about atlantas leadership at one time we had a group called the action forum  about  white successful businesspeople and  black successful businesspeople it really was an effort to bring the black community into the mainstream of what was happening in atlanta i was brought in by the black community because i supported andy the people in there particularly from the white community were the owners chairmen presidents of the companies so when they made a decision at the saturday meeting they didnt have to go and ask anyone whether it would work or not we dont have that today our banks have left us all except one cocacola has its problems today and its not providing the leadership that woodruff and goizueta and that group did delta  we all know deltas problems and they dont really have the time to put toward the community affairs and now georgiapacific has been sold and i think youll see pete correll moving out of the effort they just keep going were losing these strong leaders in atlanta gt is anybody stepping up to take their place loudermilk i dont see a number of  or yearolds coming up to take this leadership role i hope they will the young whites have been moved out of the political arena by the black community i think we have a void here i think whats tragic is that the northside white community had a lot of bright young people welleducated who loved the city would love to help and have the resources but theyve really been moved out or they feel they have been moved out gt do you think thats a permanent condition loudermilk shirley franklin and her leadership  i think lisa borders will be the next mayor with shirleys and lisas leadership all this will be put back together hopefully were just in a trough right now i think they realize the assets that atlanta has that have not been utilized for  or  years so maybe youll see some people coming up the ladder two that come to mind  a fellow named david allman president of regents partners and chairman of the buckhead community improvement district and my son robin loudermilk im sure there are others  those are just two that im close to gt are you optimistic about atlanta loudermilk yes i am we lived through eight years of bill campbell the thing is atlanta still has tremendous assets  location the airport it just needs strong leadership and shirley is providing that shirleys been a great leader some leaders have to run through people and over people shirleys done it by brains and charm she hasnt had to hammer people gt who are your heroes or people you look up to loudermilk theres a person named fritz orr who had a camp here i was fortunate enough to go for eight years to his camp his camp was where westminster is today i was fortunate because my mother ran the dining room there he let me come out with her he was really a fine role model and a mentor i was raised in a bluecollar community off of howell mill road my dad was a lineman for georgia power it was a great upbringing but we didnt have any material things to speak of my mother was the hardestworking person ive ever known and she was determined that my brother and i were going to college my mother died in  a very happy woman in that her dream had been fulfilled that her two boys had a great life gt anybody in business or public life that you admire loudermilk youd have to put martin luther king in there because of the nonviolence this country was in deep trouble from a violence point of view between the races and what i see he did was to calm that down there are a number of businesspeople i admire  sam walton and jack welch how could you not admire the two of them and the founders of home depot on a much much much larger scale they did what aaron rents has done they found a niche they found a new model so to speak home depot doesnt sell anything that wasnt sold before they came into business they just found out how the customer wanted it  in one big warehouse thats what weve done weve found how the customer wants our products and wants to pay for them this
