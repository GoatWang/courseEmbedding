edt    by luke lango investorplace contributor     the alltime highs in foot locker inc nysefl seem like years ago at this point fl stock is down about  on wednesday marking a roughly  decline in just a few weeks kicking it far off its perch near the highwater mark it set late last year source shutterstock last week grocery stores played the role of victim as amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn bought whole foods market inc nasdaqwfm traditional grocers like kroger co nysekr were killed as investors worried amazon would leverage its extensive prime ecosystem to finally make wfm affordable this week the victims are sports retailers with fl stock front and center only a day after amazon launched prime wardrobe goldman sachs put out a research note which said that nike inc nysenke is likely to start selling its products directly through amazon foot locker dicks sporting goods inc nysedks and hibbett sports inc nasdaqhibb are all down sharply in response it makes sense the last two advantages brickandmortar sports retailers had the instore experience of trying things out and a unique product line are now slowly withering away not only can consumers now try out new sneakers before buying them from the convenience of their home but it’s likely they’re also about to be able to grab nike from the most ubiquitous etailer out there making sports retailers obsolete or are they i argue that this dip is actually a great buying opportunity for fl stock here’s why why you should buy fl stock prime wardrobe and the potential of nike selling through amazon will hurt foot locker’s business but only marginally the opportunity here is that the stock is being priced for a cataclysmic change in operating performance that just won’t happen investors should remember that much unlike other retailers foot locker has successfully navigated its way through the retail carnage over the past several years while other retailers have struggled to be compspositive foot locker’s comps have been rising in the midsingledigit range while other retailers have seen margins compress dramatically due to heavy discounting foot locker’s gross margins have been stable around  in other words fl has managed to continue normal operations in an already exceedingly abnormal retail environment yes that environment promises to become even more abnormal with prime wardrobe and nike selling through amazon but those are actually rather small changes in the bigger picture of what’s going on in retail fl shares however are acting like everything has changed dramatically — it hasn’t which makes right now a buying opportunity bottom line on fl stock foot locker shares now trade below  times earnings and that’s simply unheard of in this stock moreover that’s against expectations that earnings will grow by high single digits over the next few years making the pe even more of a bargain foot locker also sports a decent war chest of more than  billion big cash flows and a growing dividend that is suddenly throwing off a decent yield of about  i see support kicking in soon at this compressed a multiple with such a strong balance sheet and cash flow situation all of the bad is priced in and then some if the next couple of quarterly results show that things at foot locker are normal expect fl stock to shoot higher in a collective gasp of relief the riskreward asymmetry lies in favor of

sneaker vendor is putting up consistently strong sales growth while other retailers are flailing jeremy bowman tmfhobo nov   at am retail stocks have gotten walloped this past quarter disappointing results at bigbox chains like walmart stores and target as well as department stores like macys and apparel chains like gap have caused a selloff across the sector pressures including declining mall traffic the growth of ecommerce and fast fashion brands like hm and zara are all squeezing traditional retail giants  not all stocks are getting lost in the shuffle however foot locker nysefl that seemingly ordinary mall staple has been thriving in the years since the recession in its thirdquarter earnings report comparable sales jumped  beating nearly every other retailer and the stock shot up  over the last five years shares of the athletic retailer have more than tripled easily outperforming the sp  and rivals like finish line nasdaqfinl and dicks sporting goods nysedks which have tumbled with the recent retail doldrums  fl data by ycharts so whats in foot lockers secret sauce here are two of the main keys to the companys recent growth riding the athleisure trendwhile plenty of retailers have gotten hammered in recent months theres one particular segment of the industry thats been flying high athletic apparel sales have been soaring pushing the stocks of manufacturers like nike inc nysenke and under armour to record highs thanks to a fashion trend known as athleisure workoutstyle clothes have become more acceptable as casualwear and more and more americans are trading in jeans for yoga pants and other such staples of the segment  that trend has also favored sales of sneakers foot lockers core product the chain has a  share of the market for basketball shoes which tend to be expensive and highmargin and from which the company derives half of its sales in its recent earnings call management noted that the sneakers of young players like kyrie irving and stephen curry are beginning to catch on a sign that shoe sales are headed higher sales in the basketball category have grown at double digits for the last three years  the companys close relationship with nike has also helped fuel growth as the swoosh has seen its own doubledigit sales growth for the last several years more than  of foot lockers sales comes from nike products and the company is nikes most important vendor representing close to  of its sales that relationship enables foot locker to get exclusive nike products which have made it a winner with shoebuyers  smart strategyindustry trends alone arent what made foot locker into the  billion company it is today much of the credit goes to ken hicks the ceo who guided the company from  until retiring a year ago hicks took over when the chain was floundering through the recession and delivered whats now  straight quarters of comparable sales growth and a fivefold increase in earnings per share  he closed underperforming stores so that the companys footprint is actually smaller than it was when he took over and invested in the remaining stores creating synergies between the companys different chains which include six footaction and champs sports the stores have also become more unique by adding departments like house of hoops puma labs and adidas collector shops which make the store a bigger draw than the product alone would hicks has also placed a special effort on keeping the product and the store experience fresh and new remodeling stores and updating selections foot locker is the nations biggest athletic footwear retailer with over  stores worldwide and its size and success have kept competitors like dicks and finish line at bay the company has set a goal of reaching  billion in sales by  up from  billion last year and increasing its sales per square foot by more than  to  to do so it plans to leverage many of the strategies that have already paid off growing the six brand for
