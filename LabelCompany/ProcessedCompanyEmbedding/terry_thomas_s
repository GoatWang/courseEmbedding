wrote about this seattle building under the title smart architect builds dumb building i meant it as a compliment we need more dumb buildings that work like buildings used to with natural light and ventilation and without what donovan rypkema calls green thingies expensive new technologies when older simpler methods are more appropriatenow it is done and it looks terrific not only that they seem to be happy with it and have even blogged about it results so far it is still a work in progress but they say from the first week that we occupied the building we noticed how the terry thomas affected the culture of our firm while we are still collecting objective information the general mood is clearly elevated we attribute this to having proper levels of natural daylight the ability to open windows and the louvers that automatically open and close as co levels and the temperature rise and falllove the courtyard at nightwhy do i like this so much they say things like less is more in sustainable design  sustainable design is not only the wizbang hightech features of a green building simple solutions contribute to a sustainable design too they expose the structure and paint it white not only does this tell the story of how the building works the white paint enhances the light reflection for both daylight harvesting and indirect lighting of open office areas the design of the beams also serves as a design aesthetic informing other choices we made in the buildout of our office spacenoise appears to be a bit of a problem  we are tossing around ideas to mitigate the sound – white noise machines additional homasote boards on blank walls – but one of our unnamed principals has come up with his own solution a personal sound isolation boothhowever it appears that the terry
