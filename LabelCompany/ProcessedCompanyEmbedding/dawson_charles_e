by eric gill  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide this collection centers on eric gills drawing of a woman in a hat which he submitted to the practical correspondence college as a test sketch in response to their advertisement the advertisement featured an unfinished picture of a woman and invited prospective students to fill in the facial features as a test of their artistic aptitude duly impressed charles e dawson replied two days later stating that while gills work showed unusual promise he would of course require a regular methodical system of instruction in order to actually sell any of his art to this end dawson enclosed a scholarship certificate offering gill one half off the regular tuition fee presumably gill sent no reply so a few weeks later the college principal vincent lockwood wrote to encourage him to apply hoping that gill might be swayed by testimonials from former students who were now successfully putting their new artistic skills to work lockwood sent his last letter the following month offering further financial incentives in the form of tuition coupons however gill did not enroll by 9 he was already wellestablished as a sculptor engraver and calligrapher leading one to suspect that the original submission was an elaborate joke on gills part perhaps to demonstrate the nature of art instruction for profit pastel or crayon

advertisements for beauty schools and products such as annie malones poro college and valmor products which were targeted to the citys burgeoning black population enterprising selfassured and a tireless “race man” dawson made powerful contributions to the efforts of black artists in the city to achieve recognition dawsons life story is told in great detail and piquancy in an unpublished—and rarely cited—autobiography which is now in the dusable museum of african american history in chicago born to hardworking middle class parents in the atlanticcoast town of brunswick georgia dawson

eventually receiving the artists approvalwith money earned in the summer of 9 working in a pullman buffet club car dawson was able to fulfill his dream of attending the art institute of chicago in contrast to the art students league where dawson experienced overt racial hostility the policy of the art institute in dawsons words was “entirely free of bias” in addition to spending summers as a pullman porter out of chicago dawson was helped by art institute staff to find a number of interesting jobs to help him with tuition as a waiter at chicagos elite cliff dwellers club he watched proudly as african american émigré artist henry ossawa tanner was treated as an honored visitor he was also secretary of the chicago architectural league and manager of the annual chicago architectural exhibition held at the art institute dawson threw himself into student organizations such as the art students league of chicago and was a founding member of the arts and letters society which was the first black artists collective in chicago dawsons attempts to assert his leadership over black students at the art institute fueled a rivalry with his younger classmate archibald j motley jr who would go on to become a more famous artist than dawsonafter graduation from the school of the art institute in 9 only weeks after the united states entered world war i dawson was accepted for officer training in the segregated armed forces he saw combat in france as a lieutenant in the allblack th regiment of the 9nd infantry division the buffalo soldiers dawson returned to a

downtown firm called chicago engravers where he served black and white clients leaving the firm to become a freelancer dawson executed advertising illustrations for major black entrepreneurs—and competitors—anthony overton and jesse binga who owned banks newspapers and life insurance companies and manufactured beauty products dawson also provided drawings for the shortlived chicago magazine reflexus reflects us as well as ads for black film director oscar micheaux dawson continued to pursue work as a fine artist with other alumni of the art institute including william edouard scott and william mcknight farrow in 9 dawson established the black exhibiting group the chicago art league he also played a key role in the most important manifestation of the new negro movement in the visual arts the 9 negro in art week exhibition at the art institute of chicago organized by alain locke and sponsored by the chicago womans club the exhibition was the first to show africanamerican art at a major american museumwith the onset of the great depression which struck chicago very hard dawson managed to stay afloat largely through his work for valmor products company the owner of the company morton neumann who later became famous as one of chicagos great art collectors refused to allow dawson to sign his work dawson was the only black artist to have a substantial role in the – century of progress fair when he received a commission for a mural illustrating the great migration for the national urban leagues display in the hall of social science dawson also produced a poster for the pageant of negro music o sing a new song which took place at soldier field as part of the fair in august  another noteworthy product of the early s was dawsons childrens book abcs of great negroes the
