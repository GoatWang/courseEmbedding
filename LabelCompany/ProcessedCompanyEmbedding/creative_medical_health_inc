appropriate quantities of insulin a hormone produced in the pancreas that is secreted into the bloodstream insulin is required for the body to use convert glucose sugar from food into energy in individuals with type  diabetes excessive intake of carbohydrates creates a high demand for insulin however inadequate insulin production by the pancreas and resistance to the effects of insulin leads to sustained and high levels of glucose in the blood hyperglycemia the more uncontrolled the blood sugar levels are the higher the risk and severity of complications which include kidney damage cardiovascular disease eye disease and skin and mouth condition a healthy diet including adequate intake of essential nutrients can make all the difference for keeping blood sugar levels under control
