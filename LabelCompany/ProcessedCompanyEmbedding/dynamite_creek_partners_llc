limited liability company faqs q would an llc be better than filing a fictitious business name a regadless you will need to register the name instead just form an llc or an s corporation though llcs are preferred these days for example if the assumed business name is  deas xyztch dymamite vapor productsco this name as well as any other name is an assumed business name and it must be recorded as a dba doing business as name which also requires a fee to be recorded just recording an assumed business name does nothing to keep the name exclusive nor does it avoid personal liability for the business owners only setting up a limited liability company llc will protect the name at the state level and also protect the owners of personal liability it is perhaps a better choice to just incorporate for the same or a little higher fee because you will also have corporate protection for the business name and personal vs business liabilities eg if your business has debts the lender can sue you personally to obtain a judgment vs your personal assets as opposed in the case you were a corporation where the lender could only sue the corporation directly and if the limited liability company llc had no assets the lender could get nothing a limited liability company llc affords more prestige and it helps you obtain business loans q what state should i form an llc in a though you

llc we could do it for you because we have lawyers on our payroll q do i need to obtain a federal or state llc number before forming a limited liability company llc or getting other licenses a q what is a duns number a dun  bradstreet is a business credit rating company and they use your info to inform lenders about how credit worthy you are q do i need to pay sales tax to the state as an llc a
