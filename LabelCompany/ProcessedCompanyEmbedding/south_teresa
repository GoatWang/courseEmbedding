well done teresa permalink well done teresa the cards were still being dealt with this particular gamble and the stakes were high camila still had no way to distribute that much product although she showed no signs of giving up her hand  but with every move the game became more dangerous  even as teresa was being praised for her daring decisions james was paying the price for his  camila youre making judgement calls nowjames teresa makes them you pat her on the back i make them im insubordinate permalink teresa makes them you pat her on the back i make them im insubordinate when they left for bolivia james was unquestionably camila’s right hand man but his decision to spare guero after the man save his life put him on the outs with his boss  and it was difficult to blame camila for being upset there’s no denying that guero is a liability the dea is on his trail and he’s got a history of playing ball with them  if the feds picked up guero would he turn on camila and teresa i honestly don’t know the answer to that  as camila pointed out to teresa in this queen of the south quote… if you want to succeed as a businesswoman teresa you have to learn how to control your weaknesses before somebody else exploits them and costs you your life camila permalink if you want to succeed as a businesswoman teresa you have to learn how to control your that left me wondering if the man teresa shot after he left her bed in queen of the south season  episode  was indeed guero because little by little teresa is taking camila’s lessons to heart  camila’s strategy of sending the charm to isabela was genius epifanio sent her the cash she needed to buy time with el santo  but he also murdered two of his main distributors who were about to work with camila it certainly sent a message but didn’t it harm epifanio’s business just as much as camila’s what i appreciated most was epifanio taking isabela to his childhood farm and explaining how the crocodile murdered her grandparents  i got into this life so that you wouldnt have to come home and see your mother and father hanging from a tree i had no choice you do epifanio permalink i got into this life so that you wouldnt have to come home and see your mother and father isabela has been far too sheltered for far too long but she wasn’t wrong her parents business is her own crocodile and i have little doubt that it will eventually turn and bite her  and did anyone else enjoy the irony of teresa worrying that a video game was too violent given the world in which she lives i also really enjoyed seeing kelly anne again although i question the dea’s tactics with her  was showing her the horribly graphic photos of the people camila vargas has supposedly murdered really supposed to make her leave her rich husband and turn over evidence on a drug cartel the way i saw it those photos were even more of a reason for her to keep her mouth shut  if kelly anne was smart she would have gone to cole and told him what happened but strategic thinking may not be high on the list of kelly anne’s gifts  however i did find it amusing that it wasn’t the murder and mayhem that had her questioning her life choices it was whether her husband was having an affair with camila  kelly anne we all kind of gave up our lives for the fairy tale but the fairy tale is bullshitteresa why are you telling me all of this kelly anne im a notorious over sharer i just wanted you to know that we aint perfect theres a lot of skeletons in these walk in closets teresa whats yourskelly anne my skeletons how much time do you have i think your boss camila is sleeping with my husband permalink my skeleton how much time do you have i think your boss camila is sleeping with my husband i was hoping that kelly anne was going to tell teresa about her visit from the dea but that obviously wasn’t on the agenda  i also question why teresa didn’t tell camila the truth about kelly anne’s motives i doubt camila would be embarrassed by such a thing it felt like information she should have and i’m curious why teresa held it back  but camila’s biggest issue is her war with epifanio  yes thank you so much for the payment but im not shutting down if you want your metric ton youre welcomed to come and pry it from my cold dead hands camila permalink yes thank you so much for the payment but im not shutting down if you want your metric if that’s not epifanio’s plan it’s definitely colonel cortez’s  now that epifanio has teamed up with the dea on the task force he’s going to bring this war right to camila’s doorstep and he’s got some serious reinforcements  even someone as smart and conniving as camila vargas will have to up her game check back next week for my review of queen of the south season  episode  and if you just
