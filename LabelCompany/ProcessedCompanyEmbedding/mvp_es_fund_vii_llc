global opportunity fund x sof x starwood capital closed its 0th global opportunistic real estate fund in march  with capital commitments from more than 00 investors globally totaling  billion—the firm’s largest fund to date sof x continues the successful approach of its predecessor funds with a focus on acquiring developing and repositioning highquality assets in nearly every major real estate asset class with strong fundamentals at the same time the fund seeks investments that can generate consistent and growing cashoncash returns either sourced directly in partnerships or joint ventures the major change with sof x’s investment strategy is an increased focus on europe as we expect a growing number of opportunities to emerge from the region leveraging its robust pipeline starwood capital through sof x is wellpositioned to invest opportunistically in compelling properties around the world while continuing to be patient and thus avoid rushing to compete for overpriced transactions starwood distressed opportunity fund ix sof ix starwood capital closed its ninth global opportunistic real estate fund in april  with  billion of total capital commitments from more than 00 investors around the world the portfolio is diversified by both geography and product type and has been constructed to focus on strong cash returns during the investment period sof ix has continued

inflation hedge corporate transactions and landdevelopment opportunities starwood global opportunity fund viii sof viii starwood capital closed its eighth global opportunistic real estate fund in march 0 with total equity commitments of  billion due to global uncertainty and volatility during our investment period we focused on “margin of safety” one clear measure of this approach is overall leverage that is extremely low for any type of fund but especially for a real estate opportunity fund we also sought investments that provided downside protection asymmetric riskreward profiles and hedges against inflation the fund pursued five major investment themes landresidential valueadd income assets distressed debt corporate transactions and global hospitality our transaction sourcing is
