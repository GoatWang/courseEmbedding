main building ← eskay’s albumenized food philadelphia pa red raven co harmerville pa → joseph burnett company boston ma posted on may   by jessica the joseph burnett company’s claim to fame was a useful innovation in the production of vanilla extract unlike most of his competitors having graduated from the worcester college of pharmacy burnett stands out as one of the few fully qualified proprietors certified as a pharmacist in this capacity he played a role in the first painless dental surgery publicly performed using ether as well as producing a string of less effective products which include a cocaine product to “stimulate healthy and vigorous hair growth” he also seems to have been a progressive guy who founded an episcopal church in boston that was “free to all with no distinctions as to wealth color race or station” bottle embossed “burnett’s standard flavoring extracts” according to the southborough historical society  “the joseph burnett company unofficially began in  when druggistchemist joseph burnett developed a vanilla extract for flavoring foods at the time he was a partner with theodore metcalf a boston druggist joseph burnett began as an apprentice to theodore metcalf in  shortly after graduating from the worcester college of pharmacy in  at age  he became a full partner of the newly named metcalf and burnett chemical company before long he earned a reputation for selling only products of the purist quality in  joseph married josephine cutter and they had  children although famous for developing a vanilla extract joseph burnett also had a role in the first publicly demonstrated use of ether to conduct a painless surgery dr william thomas green morton a boston dentist was experimenting with the use of ether as an anesthetic at the massachusetts general hospital in boston he had poor results and realized the ether he was using was impure another doctor charles t jackson told him to buy all of his drugs from joseph burnett to insure their purity dr morton bought his ether from joseph burnett and performed the first successful painless operation on october   in  a prominent lady and wife of a wealthy boston manufacturer who had lived some years in france entered the store of joseph burnett she said she was very anxious to procure a vanilla flavor for her creams sauces and desserts such as she had been getting in paris at that time the only extract of any kind in this country for flavoring purposes was a cheap extract of lemon a few french chefs used the vanilla bean itself this was the clumsy unsanitary and inconvenient way these chefs got their vanilla flavoring they would purchase one or two vanilla beans cut them up and put them in a linen bag ready to use like a tea ball to flavor whatever was required the results from this tedious inexact method of extracting the flavor were of course very unsatisfactory when the bag was first used it would give the delicious flavor of pure vanilla but afterwards when it became diluted the taste was weak and unpalatable it was never uniform in strength or flavor it was always expensive because the full rich flavor could never be thoroughly extracted mr burnett listened to the lady’s description of the flavoring she wanted this extraordinary request challenged mr burnett’s resourcefulness a man ahead of his time he believed in supplying what his customers needed if he could he busied himself in his laboratory he went to new york and bought a pound of the very best vanilla beans he could procure for  and extracted the rare delicate flavor of which she spoke and after long careful experiments when he was satisfied with its quality he made the first vanilla extract “the lady was so pleased she urged him to make more promising to take her supplies of it from him and to introduce it to her aristocratic friends this was the beginning of vanilla and other extracts in this country and throughout the world joseph burnett soon saw that if one flavor made business good additional flavors would make business even better in  he became a partner with william g edmonds and the company became known as joseph burnett  co soon his products were sold not only in the united states but all over the world as well this policy of continuing to introduce new products distinguished the company throughout its history by this time the company produced lemon vanilla almond rose nutmeg peach celery cinnamon cloves nectarine ginger and orange extracts they also produced and sold wood violet perfume cologne cocoaine for the hair which he invented in  and sold for over  years florimel a perfume for the handkerchief kalliston for a healthy skin and complexion jamaica ginger for the stomach oriental tooth wash cod liver oil jonas whitcomb’s asthma remedy and several other personalmedical products by the early th century with the stricter drug laws and regulations some of these products were no longer produced by the company so only food related products and some toiletry products would be marketed by the ’s the joseph burnett co was engaged solely in the preparation of flavoring extracts color pastes  liquids spices and mixes in  just before joseph burnett died a new factory was opened at  india street about this time the increasing interest in fancy cooking warranted the marketing of a pure color for coloring candies frostings etc after extended experimenting in the laboratory and kitchen burnett’s color pastes were on the market the joseph burnett company was incorporated in  joseph’s sons harry treasurer and robert interim president and john t who later  became president of the company continued the manufacturing policy of their father which was to make the very finest extracts that could be made and advertise the fact to the consumer the wisdom of this policy can be discerned in the steady growth of the sales which by the ’s necessitated the building of a fine new factory equipped with all the latest machinery for manufacturing packaging and handling the various products in  after a careful market analysis it was decided that fine spices could be handled to advantage and so burnett’s spices the choicest grown in the tropics were added to the extract line during the ’s thru the ’s the burnett company added mint jelly marshmallow flavored puddings a liquidmix for making ice cream and sherbet a readymix powder for making ice cream and a pie crust and muffin mix many different flavors and colors were added to the extract food coloring and paste products at this time burnett’s boasted  extract flavors the joseph burnett company a division of american home foods inc and known for more than a century for its flavoring extracts and food colorings introduced instant puddings of chocolate butterscotch and of course vanilla in  in  the company was sold to american home foods inc a subsidiary of american home products corporation now known as wyeth the last ownership of the burnett products was the doxsee food corporation which stopped producing them at an unknown date doxsee food corporation which merged with snow’s seafood corporation is currently part of castleberry’s food company castleberry’s acquired the snow’s  doxsee business in ”  ad for joseph burnett company joseph burnett  co floral handbook  excerpt from six cups of coffee  prepared for the public palate

sydney battleswars world war i world war ii  battle between hmas sydney and hsk kormoran joseph burnett  december  –  november  was a royal australian navy ran officer most widely known as the captain of the light cruiser hmas sydney in the battle between hmas sydney and hsk kormoran on  november  he fought in both world war i and world war ii serving in the ran and the royal navy rn and went down with the sydney off the coast of western australia the loss of the sydney was significant for two main reasons first it represented the loss of one third of all ran officers and sailors who died during world war ii in a single engagement—and not far from australian soil at that second great mystery surrounded its loss there had been no australian survivors and so it was not clear how or why a warship had been in a position to be sunk by a less wellarmed merchant raider as commander of the sydney burnett bore primary responsibility for the ship and its crew so he was an obvious target for criticism investigations into the ships sinking have tried to examine his apparent decisions in the period leading up to the battle regardless of the events of that day burnett was viewed as a good man and competent commander by his peers his sons both pursued naval careers and served in the ran following a successful search for the sydney and kormoran that located both wrecks in  controversy surrounding burnetts command arose again his younger son retired commodore rory burnett has defended him through various public statements contents  early life  world war i  interwar years  world war

australia he was the second son of richard burnett and emily burnett née adams and the grandson of william burnett a blacksmith from cornwall who had emigrated to new south wales in  he attended singleton primary school where he demonstrated both academic and sporting ability burnetts father died when he was just seven years old and it is possible that the boy was attracted to the newly formed royal australian naval college ranc by the possibility of a free education as well as adventure on  december  he entered the ranc in geelong becoming one of its first entrants as a cadet midshipman he graduated as a midshipman from the ranc on  january  world war iedit burnetts first assignment was aboard the battlecruiser hmas australia burnett was sent to england where he served aboard hmas australia the flagship of nd battle cruiser squadron he remained with the ship for the remainder of world war i seeing service in the atlantic ocean and reached the rank of sublieutenant in october  at the conclusion of the war hmas australia sailed for australia departing on  april  and arriving on  may interwar yearsedit burnetts second posting at sea was aboard the battleship hms royal oak burnett left hmas australia before departure and remained in england on an attachment to the rn with which he served for the next seven years during this time he played on the rns rugby team and was also known for his performance in athletics cricket and tennis in january  burnett was promoted to lieutenant by  he had qualified as a gunnery officer he served aboard hms royal oak during those years in  burnett was appointed as the gunnery officer on board hmas adelaide before marrying enid ward and returning briefly to australia although still attached to the rn after three years in australia he returned to england and was promoted to lieutenant commander on  january  that year he joined hmas canberra which he stayed with until  when he attended naval staff college at greenwich he was promoted to commander in december  and remained at the college until  burnett once more returned to australia where he worked for the navy office in melbourne for two years the burnetts had two sons and a daughter patrick born  rory born  and bridget born  burnett missed the sea and in  he was reunited with hmas canberra this time as executive officer in  he returned to england for the last time serving aboard hms royal oak and hms resolution whilst in england he completed the imperial defence college course and was promoted to captain on  december  world war iiedit at the outbreak of world war ii on  september  burnett was recalled to australia where he was made assistant chief of naval staff at the navy office in melbourne by october  he had been sent to singapore as the senior ran representative at an allied conference considering the defence of the asiapacific region at the conference he called for the establishment of the naval auxiliary patrol which proved successful at patrolling harbour entrances throughout the war on  may  burnett received his first direct command when he was posted to hmas sydney the ship had already acquired a distinguished war record in the battle of the mediterranean sydney had just completed a refit and her primary duties at the time were escorting convoys the previous commanding officer was then captain john collins battle between hmas sydney and hsk kormoranedit main article battle between hmas sydney and german auxiliary cruiser kormoran the light cruiser hmas sydney was burnetts command from may  in november  hmas sydney undertook a mission to escort the troopship zealandia to the sunda strait the sydney was returning to fremantle when at about  pm on  november at a point off the coast between carnarvon and geraldton the crew sighted what appeared to be a merchant ship approximately  kilometres  nmi away and challenged it the other ship was the kormoran a merchant raider disguised as the dutch freighter straat malakka according to accounts by kormoran crew members sydney chased and overhauled the raider while exchanging signals and attempting to verify her identity the sydney closed to within  yards and demanded a password from the kormoran at which point the raider opened fire on the sydney survivors accounts seemed to indicate that the sydney was not ready for the engagement and the australian cruiser was hit several times before returning fire at this point the sydney had caught fire the sydney was better armoured and more heavily armed than the kormoran and struck her severely on the funnel and engine room which caught fire immediately with both ships critically damaged the sydney turned southwards she disappeared from the view of the kormoran and sank with all hands on board the kormoran was too badly damaged to be saved and was scuttled by her captain controversyedit the loss of the sydney was a significant event in australia—of all the ran officers and sailors who died during world war ii one third of them went down with the sydney manywho found it difficult to believe that a converted merchant ship could sink a modern light cruiser and also found it difficult to believe that a senior officer such as burnett took his ship within  metres  yards of an unidentified and possibly dangerous vessel during wartime without preparing for action and with such disastrous results it was also seen as strangeby whom that the bulk of the crew of the kormoran survived while there were no known survivors from the sydney in  following the discovery of the wrecks of hmas sydney and hsk kormoran controversy about burnetts alleged actions arose again in particular one german survivor of the battle had reportedly accused burnett of incompetent and criminal action—a claim refuted by rory burnett who said i dont think hes in any position to make that judgment but hes entitled to his opinion my father was a very professional and highly regarded officer he also said im not saying that closing was right indeed with hindsight it proved to be wrong but closing on suspected ships had become a wellaccepted tactic it was not doctrine but it had been used successfully before by other experienced officers in august  the australian reported that the official inquiry led by terence cole found burnett behaved inexplicably but not negligently when he brought the warship too close to a german raider legacyedit collins by then a vice admiral wrote to burnetts elder son patrick saying joe burnett was one of our finest officers an outstanding sport with a good brain—an unusual combination with these qualifications and as you so well know a happy and cheerful disposition it is not surprising that he was one of the most popular of our year burnetts sons who were aged  and  when he died both attended the ranc and went on to careers in the ran younger son rory received a special cadetship patrick reached the rank of commander and rory reached the rank of commodore

between hmas sydney and hsk kormoran on  november  he fought in both world war i and world war ii serving in the ran and the royal navy rn and went down with the sydney off the coast of western australia the loss of the sydney was significant for two main reasons first it represented the loss of one third of all ran officers and sailors who died during world war ii in a single engagement—and not far from australian soil at that second great mystery surrounded its loss there had been no australian survivors and so it was not clear how or why a warship had been in a position to be sunk by a less wellarmed merchant raider as commander of the sydney burnett bore primary responsibility for the ship and its crew so he was an obvious target for criticism investigations into the ships sinking
