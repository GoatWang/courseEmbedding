position in automationrobotics industry may be ripe for more consolidationabb nyseabb has slowly built itself into a leader in automation technologies via both inhouse product development and shrewd acquisitions with its latest acquisition of br abb has transformed itself into an endtoend provider of automation and robotic technologies the global trend towards increased automation across all industries is very clear the largest economy in the world the us may already be in the midst of a manufacturing renaissance powered by automation and robotics in a recent article about rockwell automation nyserok i had stated that convergence of robotics industrial automation and enterprise software is very likely after studying abb i am convinced that the convergence is essential to drive productivity gains and to reduce costs in the long run until january  abb was comprised of five divisions discrete automation  motion low voltage products process automation power products power systems as of january   abb streamlined its operations and organized under four divisions power grids o the power grids division which was formed from the combination of its power products and power systems divisions offers electrical and automation products system software and service solutions across the electric utility business electrification products o this division offers solutions across the full electrical value chain from substation to the point of electricity consumption o the products in this category include modular substation packages distribution automation products switchgear circuit breakers measuring and sensing devices control products etc discrete automation and motion o this division provides products and solutions that increase industrial productivity and energy efficiency o products in this division are motors generators drives power electronics and robotics process automation o this division offers integrated control products systems and service offerings to customers in oil and gas minerals and mining metals pulp and paper chemicals and pharmaceuticals food and beverage power generation and marine industries discrete and process automation divisions accounted for  or about  billion of the revenue in  in fact automation has consistently accounted for over  of the revenue since  exhibit abb total revenue and revenue from discrete and process automation source company filings exhibit discrete and process automation as a  of total revenue source company filings author calculations abb reports its revenue from the robotics business under discrete automation and motion since  the robotics business has seen a turnaround and it grew at a doubledigit pace in  abbs robotics business continued to show growth in  through  cagefree robots or cobots traditionally for robots to safely work alongside humans they needed to be in cages keeping robots in cages did help with safety of human workers but it also made the manufacturing line inflexible and increased cost but a new range of cagefree robots or collaborative robots are bringing multiple benefits to the manufacturing line these include increased flexibility to deploy the robots for different tasks along a manufacturing line lower cost to deploy robots in manufacturing safe work environments for human workers to work alongside cobots also as robots get smarter faster and cheaper theyre being deployed to more tasks abb introduced its collaborative robot called yumi in  this product is an acknowledgement by abb that collaborative robots are here to stay and could potentially be used in more tasks across different industries exhibit number of robots sold in the us is increasing source pwc exhibit robots taking on new jobs in different industries source pwc yumi  creating an automated future together you and me source abb website exhibit abb yumi collaboration robot source company website according to the international federation of robotics between  and  the average robot sales increase was at  per year compounded annual growth rate cagr between  and  the average annual number of robots sold was about  units between  and  the average annual supply rose to about  units exhibit number of industrial robots sold worldwide source international federation of robotics the size of the industrial robotics market in the us and the world as measured by number of units sold might seem less but as robots become cheaper and more adoptable to tasks in different industries its use will continue to grow even before abb introduced the yumi collaborative robot it was seeing good growth in its robotics business yumi might increase the total addressable market for abb acquisition of br abb acquired br automation in april of  br had  million in revenue at the time of the acquisition exhibit snapshot of br automation source company filings this acquisition propels abb into a leadership role in industrial automation and completes the product portfolio in this key segment that is a driver of industrial internet of things iiot exhibit abb now has a complete portfolio of products for industrial automation source company filings the current low oil prices coupled with the low prices for metals and minerals has put a lot of pressure on these heavy industries to improve productivity and lower cost it seems fairly certain at this time that barring a rise in geopolitical tensions oil prices will remain low for the foreseeable future as shown in the charts above abb generates substantial revenues from process automation and the use of robots and industrial automation is one way to achieve increased productivity abb is well positioned to take advantage of convergence of robotics and industrial automation the br acquisition further strengthens abb in the factory automation space there might be more consolidation in the robotics space due to the convergence and also due to competitive forces disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
