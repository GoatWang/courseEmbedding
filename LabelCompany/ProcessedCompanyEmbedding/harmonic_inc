encoders vibe cp pristine video quality at the front of the broadcast contribution chain the industry’s best value for highend digital satellite news gathering dsng and live sports broadcasting applications the vibe cp formerly ellipse  family of contribution encoders combines superior video quality the highest level of function integration and ease of use in an economical compact package the innovative vibe cp product family includes the first dsng encoder with an integrated broadcast satellite modulator that supports the dvbsx and dvbcid standards as well as broadcastquality video contribution over the open internet vibe cp encoders support all sd and hd mpeg and mpeg avc codecs at  or   or bit subsampling fully firmware upgradeable the encoders offer a smooth and costeffective migration path from mpeg sd  bit to avc hd  bit compression schemes making them among the most versatile contribution encoders available g sdi input enables encoding of hd content at resolutions up to p highlights mpeg and mpeg avc sdhd  bit encoding broad sdhd format support up to p audio encoding of up to eight stereo or  mono channels optional integrated broadcast satellite modulator supporting dvbsssx and dvbcid on top of nitcid rolloff factor up to  broadcastquality video contribution over the internet ebook media over ip a primer to applying ip to video workflows get the ebook vibe cp features pristine video quality the ability to encode p content in avc  bit enables the transmission of exceptionally vivid video augmenting your ability to offer customers the highest video quality available low capex reduced opex the integrated modulator in the vibe cp and  eliminates the need to purchase costly external standalone devices for satellite uplink secondgeneration dvbsx support on the ellipse  offers improved performance for dsng and contribution applications and enables efficient migration to emerging technologies such as hevc and ultra hd integrated broadcast satellite modulator the onboard modulator on the vibe cp offers dvbssdsng transmission modes the vibe cp supports dvbsx as well both the devices offer qpsk psk qam and apsk modulation the encoders support if or lband outputs which can directly feed the upconverter providing a very compact uplink package contribution over the internet with support for broadcastquality video contribution over unmanaged networks vibe cp dramatically alters the economics of gathering and distributing news and sports content from locations with internet access content protection vibe cp encoders help prevent signal interception with industrystandard biss mode  and bisse encryption the devices support the new carrier id system dvbcid currently under development making it easier to identify interfering carriers and respond to a radio frequency interference event — improving quality of service and reducing operating costs endtoend highquality contribution vibe cp encoders are the perfect complement to harmonic’s proview™  and proview  integrated receiverdecoders compress avc hd  bit video with the vibe cp then use the proview  for decompression at the same sampling and bitrate resulting in a
