opening in  it’s said to have gained thousands of clients who attend classes that incorporate “flirty fun and sexy moves that keep them wanting more” its mantra is “anything is possible if you believe baby” and what the brass at bods believes baby is that this company has the potential to be huge but right now it’s small hobs has just one location and last quarter its revenue was  how can bods achieve a transformation akin to those of clients who started out tubby out of shape and unable to do a single high kick and in time “sweated themselves sexy” two words dvd infomercial bods feels extremely confident that its key to success is the production of a fitness dvd that will be sold via infomercial from there sky’s the limit but making and shooting dvds costs money and money is something bods doesn’t have right now that’s why the team has decided to do an initial public offering sans underwriters and raise the money from you the people interested the details house of bods is offering “up to  shares of common stock” its auditor has “raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern” some of its officers and directors are not focused on the biz fulltime “which may result in conflicts of interest in allocating their time between bods’ operations and other businesses” it’s really putting all its eggs in one basket with this dvd there are a lot of risks in doing that which include that fact that  people may not “embrace the dvd”  there could be “shipment delays”  competitors might come out with their own better dvds  clients might say “to hell with your dvds we want the live show” having said that bods is pretty confident it’s got a potentially great product on its hands namely because it’s going to star bods president ceo and director

“our” refer to house of bods fitness inc a delaware corporation   general   we were incorporated in the state of delaware on october   our business operations were originally conducted under a wholly owned subsidiary bods…transcending company bodt bodt was incorporated in the state of florida on september   and was terminated on september   in  the company determined that it no longer needed to continue to operate through a subsidiary and all of its operations were transferred to company   our founder and chief executive officer tammy skalko is our only fulltime employee and we currently have no parttime employees or contracted dancefitness instructors ms skalko has recently developed her own dance fitness program which has become very popular with our clients since she began teaching the program our fitness program created for women works out “body and mind” elevating the spirit while burning calories the mantra of “anything is possible if you believe baby” runs through the program and “sweat yourself sexy” is one of the many tenets of the fun dance sessions encompassing our fitness program our new approach to exercise making exercise fun through dance trx training and kickboxing takes the bore and lack of motivation out of traditional exercising and entices the audience with flirty fun and sexy moves that keep them wanting more our program creates a style of exercise that captivates our participants in such a way that it keeps them moving our “fun” atmosphere motivates the individual to keep going while benefiting from the exercise ms skalko our ceo has led a hectic life as the mother of  children she has personally found that the house of bods fitness program has helped her maintain her figure and given her the energy required to run a business and raise her children   the company has recently focused on training and business development and therefore does not presently have any dance studios open ms skalko continues to provide four clients with private training sessions in their homes these clients each average two sessions per week at  per session the company counts a client as any individual who has purchased at least one class or personal training session the company is currently looking for a suitable site to lease or purchase to resume dance classes and training sessions the company intends to resume classes and increase personal training sessions within  days of acquiring a facility after reviewing some major markets in atlanta la toronto daytona beach and austin tx the company has settled its search for an appropriate facility to the south florida regions including boca raton west palm beach andor ft lauderdale as the most promising these areas combine the company’s need for affordable space together with demographics most likely to desire the company’s unique brand of fitness among other things disposable income and openness towards trendy sexy dancing the company will be focusing their efforts over the coming year to acquiring an acceptable facility and reinstituting classes   clients will be able to purchase a package of either six sessionsclasses for  or  sessionsclasses for  there is no monthly membership option for studio classes and personal training sessions since our classes and individual personal training sessions will generally be of interest to individuals who live near our corporate location we expect to market the benefits of our classes and individual sessions through local advertising we estimate based on previous experience in our prior studio that within  days of the start of classes and sessions we will have  clients who will book  classes or sessions per month with an average spending of  per client each month there is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining clients   online videos and dvds   upon receipt of sufficient working capital we propose to produce our first dance fitness video series and our initial infomercial in order to produce and launch our fitness video series the company has commenced research for a contractor to film and mass produce the series ms skalko has already started planning for the content of the videos she will be the primary instructor in the video series alongside several independently contracted instructors who will show modified versions of the various routines the next step which may take up to six months to complete will be to prepare for the filming this may include a model search script editing and securing an appropriate location our plan calls for the initial dvd series to contain four dvds with different styles of dance fitness on each customers will be able to purchase the dvds individually or as a set based on research done by the company we believe the cost to produce and package a dvd series may be  per set or  per individual dvd we anticipate charging  for each set or  per individual dvd the four styles are               ● “chairotica” a fun dance aerobics class using a chair as a prop and set to familiar top  songs          ● “erotic movement” a tantric slow moving workout performed on a mat designed to teach sensual body awareness through movement as well as flexibility work          ● “body blast” a workout very similar to a typical lifestyle fitness class which will use bands balls and mats to tone tighten and tone “pole dance” a class that will teach basic pole dance moves spins and transitions while getting an aerobic dance workout   infomercials typically go through a period of onair testing and other means such as focus groups to obtain feedback that can be used to make edits designed to elicit the greatest consumer response we expect to test market our infomercial with the intention of obtaining the right formula to attract sales and make the economics of airing the infomercial nationally viable if successful in raising sufficient working capital to do so we will build our customer base through our infomercial and web marketing while infomercials will be the initial focus for our channel distribution strategy we expect to sell our products through additional channels including retail our marketing campaign will be designed to be integrated with a retail strategy such that the infomercial helps drive retail sales and build awareness for our product among consumers we expect to take our dvds to retail stores after they have gained success in the directtoconsumer market but prior to the directtoconsumer market being saturated   possible obstacles include being unable to secure a favorable proposal from a contractor to produce and launch the film or we may be unable to start filming in our suggested timeframe other possible obstacles to our dvd series include complications in finding the right extra instructors to demonstrate variations on the routines difficulty in finding a suitable location to film and unforeseen delays from the postfilm production crew complications with any of the above listed factors could cause a delay in the production and launch of our fitness dvd series the company intends to spend between  and  on the production launch and marketing of its online videos and dvds   website updates   we believe that our website wwwhouseofbodsfitnesscom will be an integral component of our direct response television marketing drtv campaigns our website may also serve as a tool to further educate the consumer about our video series and other fitness related products including exercise equipment and apparel we intend to offer it is our purpose to drive traffic to our websites via the airings of our infomercial press coverage and online marketing including banner advertisements and email marketing we will require sufficient working capital to complete these programs and will need to develop operating systems to effect online sales there can be no assurance we will have the resources to do so the company contracted with rank executives to improve our internet presence with an updated website that is functioning and aesthetically pleasing the company worked with rank executives to create logos and graphics that can be used to increase traffic to the site rank executives have also laid the foundation for the ecommerce functionality that the site will require once our dvd series has been produced   feebased virtual community   we anticipate that we will be able to gain exposure to a large number of targeted individuals through our infomercial and other marketing approaches if we are able to achieve  unique individual visitors to our website we hope to offer an online virtual community to paying members for an anticipated price of  per month this monthly membership will offer a community of services and support geared toward women including support emails personalized downloadable classes and access to additional video tutorials of interest there is no guarantee that the company will be successful in generating  unique visitors to the website the company reserves the right to reconsider the event which will trigger the offering of a paid subscription service as described in this paragraph at their sole discretion possible obstacles to implementing our paid subscription service to a virtual community include not being able to secure a favorable proposal for the website design and not being able to generate enough content for the virtual community   we propose to grow our business by expanding and increasing our online commerce anytime money is exchanged over the internet there are concerns regarding fraud privacy and other unknown problems   a significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks our failure to prevent security breaches could harm our business we expect our customers to authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transactions charged by us we will rely on encryption and authorization technology to provide the security and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information including customer credit card numbers            viralsocial media marketing   in order to expand our database we have begun to utilize viral marketing techniques marketing techniques that use preexisting social networks to produce increases in brand awareness through selfreplicating viral processes for example we have established a facebook account and plan to incorporate twitter youtube and other social media sites to market our fitness videos and provide free content and previews of our new and developing products ms skalko currently is in charge of our social media presence the company does not believe it will require any additional financing to utilize viral marketing techniques to expand our database   affiliate programs   we hope to form partnerships or distributorship with owners of websites to allow our partners to earn a commission by promoting our products andor brand links text images banners products on our affiliates’ websites we expect to provide affiliates with a range of banners coupons and product links for our dvds and other products using webbased technology we expect to be able to track visitors from each affiliate site affiliate sites could include fitness sites as well as sites dedicated to selling products from infomercials ie wwwasseenontvcom the company does not believe it will require any additional financing to utilize affiliate marketing programs   competition   the fitness club industry is highly competitive and continues to become more competitive in the market in which we operate or the markets in which we expect to operate we compete with other fitness clubs physical fitness and recreational facilities established by local governments hospitals and businesses for their employees amenity and condominium clubs the ymca and similar organizations and to a certain extent with racquet and tennis and other athletic clubs country clubs weight reducing salons and the homeuse fitness equipment industry we also compete with other entertainment and retail businesses for the discretionary income in our target demographics the number of competitor clubs that offer lower pricing and a lower level of service continue to grow in our markets and in markets in which we expect to operate the trend to larger outersuburban multirecreational family fitness centers in areas where suitable real estate is more likely to be available also compete against our suburban fitnessonly models we will face intense competition in the dvd fitness arena including from fitness dvds productions featuring entertainment and other icons who are well established in this and other industries zumba and dancing with the stars are two examples of popular dance fitness dvds many of these competitors are well established and have substantially more resources available to them then we do   material agreements   the company currently has no material agreements   certain relationships and related transactions   from november  to november  the company did not pay any rent for the use of the facility that housed our fitness operations the facility was  owned by an entity owned by the company’s majority shareholder there was no agreement for the company to pay rent nor was there a binding agreement for use of the facility to be provided indefinitely on a rentfree basis the fair value of this arrangement was reflected in the financial statements as rent expense and a capital contribution by a shareholder the

  we presently have only one  employee who is also our president and ceo staffing levels will be determined as we progress and grow the level of employees is primarily contingent on the funds available for operations our board of directors will determine the compensation of all new employees based upon job description   item a risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this report in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing shares of our company’s common stock our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks you could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks   risks related to our financial condition   we will need additional infusions of capital   we will need outside funding to provide the working capital necessary to implement our business plan funding is necessary for us to produce our initial dance fitness dvd and online video series and infomercial and to increase our presence on the internet if we fail to arrange for sufficient working capital in the future we will not be able to expand operations until we can obtain adequate financing we may not be able to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms when needed which will adversely affect our prospects if we do not raise the necessary capital we may not be able to continue as a going concern debt financing must be repaid regardless of whether or not we generate profits or sufficient cash flow from our business activities to satisfy the obligations            any capital we do raise will likely result in dilution to our stockholders’ ownership and voting rights in our company   equity financing will result in dilution to existing stockholders and may involve securities that have rights preferences or privileges that are senior to our common stock we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital andor financing including investment banking fees legal fees accounting fees printing and distribution expenses and other costs we may also be required to recognize noncash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue such as convertible notes and warrants which will adversely impact our financial condition   we have limited working capital   because we are small and have limited working capital we must limit our operations and carefully execute our business plan because we will have to limit our operations based on available working capital we may not generate sufficient sales to make a profit if we do not make a profit we may have to suspend or cease operations   our auditor has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   the report of our independent auditor regarding our audited financial statements for the period ended december   indicates that there are a number of factors that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we have an accumulated deficit since inception of  as of december   and have limited revenues our future is dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations or on the ability of the company to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations this is a significant risk to investors who purchase shares of our common stock because there is an increased risk that we may not be able to generate andor raise enough capital to remain operational management believes that its current and future plans enable it to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months due to our ability to issue debt and equity securities seek strategic partners and our current proposal to initiate additional revenue streams through our proposed dance fitness dvd’s the opening of a new studio and our online community membership fees   to meet our objectives we will need to continue to raise additional capital through the sale of our common stock and debt financing in order to support existing operations and expand the range and scope of our business however there are no assurances that we will be successful in raising capital through an equity or debt offering on acceptable terms and in a timely manner if at all we have no formal binding commitments for funding from debt and equity securities there is no assurance that we will obtain strategic partners or be able to generate sufficient additional revenue through the source identified above the failure to obtain the necessary working capital would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and if there is a shortfall the company may have to curtail or cease its operations   risks related to our business   we have recently changed our business plan and do not have sufficient operating history in the dance fitness dvd and online video industry to know if we can implement this plan successfully   we commenced operations as house of bods fitness inc in late  and have no operating history in the dance fitness dvd and online video industry on which an evaluation of our company’s new venture can be measured for that reason it may be difficult for a potential investor to judge our prospects for success   house of bods fitness inc was incorporated on october   and has not had a significant operating history from which to evaluate our business and prospects bods…transcending company our former subsidiary was organized on september   and had only one  operating dance studio we are no longer utilizing that studio and are in the process of seeking a new location after the acquisition of bodt we changed our business strategy to include the addition of our dance fitness dvd and online video model as well as individual fitness training as of this date we have had limited revenue there can be no assurance that our current operations and or our future proposed operations will be implemented successfully or that we will ever have profits if we are unable to sustain and expand our operations our stockholders would likely lose their entire investments although bodt operated our studio from november  to november  its operations have not provided substantial revenue and we do not have experience with producing a dance fitness video series we therefore face all the risks inherent in a new business including the expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with new operations including capital requirements and managements’ potential underestimation of initial and ongoing costs additionally we may encounter delays and other problems we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively implement our business plan in evaluating our business and prospects these difficulties should be considered if we are not efficient in addressing these risks we will not operate profitably or perhaps at all and we may not have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due our ability to operate as a going concern and to achieve profitable operations will depend on such factors as the success of our business model marketing strategy market penetration competition and the availability of financing no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully develop our business under the foregoing conditions and given the inherent risks            we will initially depend on only one dance studio and our personal training program to conduct our operations   we currently do not have an operating studio our initial operations will be substantially reliant on the success of our personal training program one dance studio space to be opened in the future and the market acceptance of our dance fitness dvd and online videos if we are unable to locate a new studio or our dance studio were to operate at a loss it would have a negative impact on our business and results of operation while we intend to have casualty insurance to protect us against damage and loss of our dance studio such insurance may be insufficient to protect us from any losses we may incur and would not protect us from the disruption in our operations that would likely result from any material damage to or loss of our dance studio to fire flooding or other causes which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition business and prospects   consumers may not embrace our dance fitness dvd and online videos or preferences may change   our ability to operate our business successfully is dependent initially on the success of a variety of factors including our ability to develop and sell our fitness videos and other products we introduce to the public we anticipate that our business will be targeted to consumers who assign high value to a healthy lifestyle and exercise our ability to grow our customer base and generate sales will depend initially upon customeracceptance of our fitness videos and the importance consumers place on healthy lifestyles and exercise we cannot assure you that the demographic trends on which our business plan is based will continue or that the current levels of consumer interest in healthy lifestyles and exercise will be sustained the decrease of consumer interest in these trends would materially and adversely affect the growth of our customer base and sales revenues and accordingly would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of clients to maintain or expand the business   our dance fitness studio business will depend on our ability to attract and retain clients and we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts will lead to viable client attendance levels or that the client attendance levels at the studios we may open in the future will be at levels required to achieve profitability or if profitability is realized will not materially decline there are numerous factors that could lead to a decline in attendance levels or sales of our product including changes in discretionary spending trends and general economic conditions market maturity or saturation our failure to deliver quality service at a competitive price direct and indirect competition in the areas where our studios are located and a decline in the public’s interest in health and fitness in order to achieve and maintain acceptable membership levels we may from time to time offer lower session rates any decrease in our average revenues or higher client acquisition costs may adversely impact our operating margins   our sales and operating results may vary widely   we expect to experience fluctuations in our operating results as a result of a variety of factors including but not limited to     ●  fluctuations in promotional advertising and marketing expenditures   ● the introduction of new fitness videos or other products or delays in such introductions   ● the introduction or announcement of new products by our competitors   ● customer acceptance of our new fitness videos andor other products   ● shipment delays   ● consumer perceptions of our products and operations   ● competitive pricing pressures   ● the adverse effect of our distributors’ or suppliers’ failure and allegations of their failure to comply with applicable regulations   ● economic conditions in general and in the fitness and lifestyles industry in particular   ● the negative effect of changes in or interpretations of regulations that may limit or restrict the sale of certain of our products   ● the expansion of our operations into new markets and   ● the introduction of our products into each new market   any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we have no operating history in the dance fitness video market and therefore it is difficult to predict our future sales or our ability to identify and adapt our fitness videos or other products successfully to meet changing consumer interest trends and other elements that affect our results of operations   we have a lack of long term agreements   our business does not lend itself to long term agreements by our customers since our customer base has several choices in identifying the kinds of exercise that best fits their lifestyle and budget we are not able to calculate with certainty our revenue on a long term basis such lack of certainty means that there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition            we must achieve trade and consumer acceptance in distribution channels and may not be able to do so   while our initial marketing efforts will focus on infomercials promoting our dance fitness dvd and online videos and local advertising promoting our dance fitness studios our growth will depend in part on our ability to attract and maintain customers and expand our channels of marketing and distribution these channels of marketing and distribution are expected to present competitive challenges risks and marketing and distribution costs in addition our expansion in these channels of distribution will require us to attract and retain consumers in broader demographic and geographic markets there can be no assurance that we will achieve successful distribution through nationwide distribution channels and with consumers in other demographic and geographic markets the inability to obtain consumer acceptance in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   if we are unable to identify and acquire suitable sites for new studios our revenue growth rate and profits may be negatively impacted   to successfully expand our business over the long term we must identify and acquire studio sites that are suitable for our dance fitness customers in addition to finding sites with the right geographical demographic and other measures we also need to evaluate the penetration of our competitors in the market we face competition from other health and fitness center operators for sites and as a result we may lose desirable sites our competitors could copy our format or we could be forced to pay higher prices for those sites if we are unable to identify and acquire sites for new studios on acceptable terms our revenue growth rate and profits may be negatively impacted additionally if our analysis of the suitability of a site is incorrect we may not be able to recover our capital investment in developing and building the new studio   we may experience prolonged periods of losses in our proposed new studios   in considering the opening of a new studio we expect to experience an initial period of operating losses we expect that fees from clients will generate insufficient revenue for the studio to initially generate positive cash flow as a result a new studio will likely generate an operating loss in its first full year of operations and substantially lower profit margins in its second full year of operations than a studio opened for more than  months these operating losses and lower margins will negatively impact our future results of operations this negative impact will be increased by the initial expensing of preopening costs which include legal and other costs associated with lease negotiations and permitting and zoning requirements as well as depreciation and amortization expenses which will further negatively impact our net income we may at our discretion accelerate or expand our plans to open new studios which may adversely affect results from operations   we may incur rising costs related to construction of a new studio   our proposed new studio will require an initial upfront investment if our investment is higher than we had anticipated we may need to outperform our operational plan to achieve our targeted return over the longer term we believe that we can offset cost increases by increasing our persession and other fees and improving profitability through cost efficiency strategies however higher costs in certain regions where we may open new studios may be difficult to offset in the shortterm   we are dependent on our ability to negotiate lease arrangements with operators for fitness facilities   our business plan depends in part on our ability to negotiate reasonable lease terms with facility operators in the future we cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate new leases or renew the leases that have expired on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to secure such a lease or if we can only secure such leases on reasonable terms that are less than optimal for us we may not be able to implement our business plan which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   we may not be able to successfully integrate dance studios that we open in the future   if we have the working capital necessary to do so we expect to open dance fitness studios in florida there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so if we do expand our business there can be no assurance we will be able to do so successfully   directresponse marketing is extremely competitive and we may not be able to market our dvds successfully   we plan to market our dvds via direct response marketing such as television infomercials the direct response industry is extremely competitive rapidly evolving and subject to constant change and intense marketing by providers of similar products we must be able to distinguish our products and develop new products that address the needs of our customers the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition            there are risks associated with an internet marketing strategy   we have not previously conducted marketing programs according to practices common to internet industries the costs for new information technology systems needed to efficiently engage in internet sales could be substantial as could the amount of time needed to acquire and implement such systems the inability to create or purchase the technology required or to do so in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   we initially will have a very narrow product line dependence on new products   we expect initially to have a very limited product line we propose to start with a dance fitness dvd and online video featuring tammy skalko there can be no assurance that our products will achieve market acceptance any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we believe that our ability to increase sales is partially dependent upon our brand name and ability to introduce new dance fitness dvds and online videos and other products such as workout apparel and related fitness equipment the success of new dvds and online videos and other products depends on a number of factors including our ability and creative skills to develop products that appeal to consumers and that are priced competitively there can be no assurance that our efforts to develop new products will be successful that consumers will accept new products or that our competitors will not introduce products that achieve greater market acceptance than our products   we may be dependent on retail customers and distributors   we may sell our products including workout apparel and related fitness equipment through distributors that resell to retail customers we may also seek to establish sales to retail customers directly such distributors and retail customers would likely purchase our products with standard purchase orders and in general are not bound by longterm contracts there can be no assurance that any such distributors and retail customers will establish a relationship with us the lack of a distributor or a significant number of retail customers or a significant reduction in purchase volume by or financial difficulty of such customers or distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   we are subject to risks associated with advertising   advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the ftc under the federal trade commission act which prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices including dissemination of false or misleading advertising in addition the national advertising division of the council of better business bureaus inc “nad” administers a selfregulatory program by the advertising industry to ensure truth and accuracy in national advertising nad both monitors national advertising and entertains inquiries and challenges from competing companies and consumers although we do not believe that such regulations will materially negatively affect our marketing efforts any future changes to our advertising resulting from compliance with an adverse nad determination or ftc action or fines or penalties assessed in connection therewith could adversely affect our product marketing efforts and there can be no assurance that such required changes in advertising would not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   we are dependent on third party manufacturers for the manufacture and shipment of our products   we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and are therefore dependent on third parties for the manufacture of our products whether dvds workout apparel or related fitness equipment we will rely on contract manufacturers to produce several of our products these contract manufacturers may also produce products for our competitors if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to produce and ship our products in a timely manner or to produce sufficient quantities to support our growth if any we would have to identify and qualify new contract manufacturers there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify and qualify new contract manufacturers in a timely manner or that such manufacturers would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements which could adversely affect our ability to make timely deliveries of our products in addition there can be no assurance that the capacity of the contract manufacturers will be sufficient to fulfill our orders and any supply shortfall could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition to successfully operate our business we must receive timely delivery of merchandise from our vendors and suppliers as we grow some of these vendors may not have sufficient capital resources or personnel to satisfy their commitments to us any significant delay in the delivery of products by vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the contract manufacturers will be contractually required to maintain the quality of the products we sell and to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to the production of such products there can be no assurance that our contract manufacturers will always produce products that are consistent with our standards the failure of any contract manufacturer to produce products that conform to our standards could materially adversely affect our reputation and result in product recalls product liability claims and severe economic loss   government laws and regulations may restrict our business   our operations and business practices are subject to federal state and local government regulations we must abide by the general rules and regulations of the federal trade commission state and local consumer protection agencies and state statutes relating to membership contracts and rules and regulations that govern the advertising sale financing and collection of memberships and other products we are also subject to state and local health regulations compliance with such rules and regulations may be expensive and time consuming and we may not have the expertise to do so            our success is dependent upon the continued services of management on which we have no “key man” insurance   our success is dependent on the continued efforts of tammy skalko our chief executive officer the loss of this individual would have a material adverse effect on our operations we anticipate that we will need to hire additional skilled personnel in all areas of our business in order to grow there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future the failure of which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we do not currently maintain “key man” life insurance on the life of any of our employees to the extent that the services of key personnel become unavailable we will be required to retain other qualified persons there can be no assurance that we will be able to employ qualified persons on acceptable terms   we may not be able to manage growth effectively   if we are successful in opening multiple dance fitness studios producing and marketing our fitness videos and initiating internet sales of our dvd we will be required to deliver quality merchandise to our customers on a timely basis at a reasonable price such demand will likely create working capital issues for us as we will need increased liquidity to fund purchase of fitness equipment and to increase our inventory of products for resale it will also place a significant strain on our management administration and operational resources we will be required to continue improving our operations management and financial systems and controls the failure to manage growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot foresee if business will grow rapidly or if our efforts to implement and expand our business will be successful   some officers and directors may also allocate their time to other businesses and such other affairs could limit attention to our activities   our executive officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs which may result in conflicts of interest in allocating their time between our operations and other businesses ms skalko our president and ceo and a member of our board of directors will commit full time to this endeavor and will allocate a minimum of  hours per week to our operations mr beshara our cfo secretary and treasurer and a member of our board of directors is engaged in other business endeavors and is not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours to our affairs however it is anticipated that he will devote from two  to four  hours per week or as needed to our affairs if other business affairs require our officers and directors to devote substantial amounts of their time to other such business affairs it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and hinder their ability to help us consummate our business plan   our officers and directors may experience conflicts of interest   our officers and directors may be and in the future may become affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those conducted and intended to be conducted by us additionally our officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which they have fiduciary or other obligations or other compelling interests accordingly they may have conflicts of interest in determining which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented tammy skalko as president and ceo will commit full time to this endeavor and will not engage in or conduct in business activities or opportunities which present a conflict of interest to our endeavor   issuance of preferred stock antitakeover effects of certain special charter and bylaw provisions   our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  par value and to ascribe certain powers thereof without any further vote or action by our stockholders including voting rights dividend rights terms of redemption conversion rights and liquidation preferences of such shares preferred stock could be issued that would have rights with respect to voting dividends and liquidation that would be adverse to those of our common stock the board of directors could approve the issuance of preferred stock to discourage attempts by others to obtain control of the company by merger tender offer proxy contest or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult and costly to achieve there are no agreements or understandings for the issuance of preferred stock and the board of directors has no present intention to issue any preferred stock   provisions in our certificate of incorporation provide for indemnification of officers and directors which could require us to direct funds away from our business   our articles of incorporation provides for the indemnification of our officers and directors we may be required to advance costs incurred by an officer or director and to pay judgments fines and expenses incurred by an officer or director including reasonable attorneys’ fees as a result of actions or proceedings in which our officers and directors are involved by reason of being or having been an officer or director of our company funds paid in satisfaction of judgments fines and expenses may be funds we need for the continued operation of our business thereby affecting our ability to attain or maintain profitability            the level of competition in the fitness club industry could negatively impact our revenue growth and profitability   the fitness club industry is highly competitive and continues to become more competitive in the market in which we operate or the markets in which we expect to operate we compete with other fitness clubs physical fitness and recreational facilities established by local governments hospitals and businesses for their employees amenity and condominium clubs the ymca and similar organizations and to a certain extent with racquet and tennis and other athletic clubs country clubs weight reducing salons and the homeuse fitness equipment industry we also compete with other entertainment and retail businesses for the discretionary income in our target demographics we might not be able to compete effectively in the future in the markets in which we operate or expect to operate competitors include companies that are larger and have greater resources than us and they may enter these markets to our detriment these competitive conditions may limit our ability to increase dues without a material loss in membership attract new members and attract and retain qualified personnel additionally consolidation in the fitness club industry could result in increased competition among participants particularly large multifacility operators that are able to compete for attractive acquisition candidates or newly constructed studio locations thereby increasing costs associated with expansion through both acquisitions and lease negotiation and real estate availability for newly constructed studio locations the number of competitor clubs that offer lower pricing and a lower level of service continue to grow in our markets and in markets in which we expect to operate these clubs have attracted and may continue to attract members away from both our dance fitness studio and can be expected to do so with respect to studios we may open in the future particularly in the current consumer environment furthermore smaller and less expensive weight loss facilities present a competitive alternative for consumers we also face competition from competitors offering comparable or higher pricing with higher levels of service the trend to larger outersuburban multirecreational family fitness centers in areas where suitable real estate is more likely to be available also compete against our suburban fitnessonly models we will face intense competition in the dance fitness dvd and online video arena including from fitness dvd productions featuring entertainment and other icons who are well established in this and other industries many of these competitors are well established and have substantially more resources available to them then we do it will be very difficult for us to establish a foothold in the dance fitness dvd and online video marketplace if we do not do so our business will be negatively affected and we may not be able to continue as a going concern considering this is a vital part of our business plan   certain factors relating to our industry   we could be subject to claims related to health or safety risks at our studios   use of our proposed studios and our fitness videos may pose potential health or safety risks to clients or guests that utilize our studios and participate in the dance programs which are central to our fitness videos there is a risk that claims will be asserted against us for injury or death suffered by our customers personal injury claims and lawsuits can result in significant legal defense costs settlement amounts and awards and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operations or cash flow in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense claims may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation our brand and our business we plan to carry all reasonable and necessary insurance coverage when we open our studio for protection in the event of any of the afore stated liability issues and will add any additional coverage as needed for fitness video production   our business may be affected by changes in trends   the health and fitness industries are subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences trends change often and unpredictably and our failure to anticipate identify or react to changes in these trends could lead among other things to reduced demand and price reductions and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and shareholder value these changes might include consumer demand for new products or fitness services our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences on a timely and affordable basis   we may face intellectual property risks   if we are successful in developing additional products we believe we may be able to rely on common law trademark rights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights to other intellectual property related to our company including but not limited to the house of bods fitness inc name and logo however there is substantial risk that these common law rights will not offer us sufficient protection if any there can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce our trademark rights for our products or register trademarks or obtain the common law trademark rights we desire in addition while we may file applications for federal registration of trademarks in the united states we may not be successful if we do so common law trademark rights do not provide us with the same level of protection as afforded by a united states federal registration of a trademark in addition common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used plus a reasonable zone of future expansion while us federal registration on the principal register gives the registrant superior rights throughout the united states subject to certain exceptions we expect to register our trademarks in certain foreign jurisdictions where our products may be sold the protection available in such jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection available to us in the united states            we may be affected by sales tax consideration from various jurisdictions   various jurisdictions included in the us are increasingly seeking to impose sales or use taxes on internet sales the imposition of sales taxes on any internet sales may have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the future any such impact cannot currently be quantified   the expansion of our business to include retail and dvdonline video sales is dependent on our development and use of online commerce   the use of the internet in the selling of products and services has become a widely accepted and effective tool in the development of sales and marketing programs for many companies from sole proprietorships to the largest corporations around the world although there is and will continually be substantial developments in security risks during the transacting of business over the internet our future net revenues and profits may be substantially dependent upon the level of confidence we are able to develop with regards to issues of fraud privacy and other problems impacted by the use of the internet in order to expand our customer and revenue generating base we propose to sell fitness videos and exercise apparel and accessories through our online storefront if we are unable to attract a sufficient consumer base with the sales of our products over the internet our operating results and financial conditions may suffer   our business is subject to online security risks   a significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks our security measures may not prevent security breaches our failure to prevent security breaches could harm our business currently many of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transactions charged by us we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information including customer credit card numbers advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer transaction data a number of web sites have reported breaches of their security any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and therefore our business in addition a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches these issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of areas where we operate security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability we are applying for although we do not currently have insurance policies in place covering these types of circumstances low coverage limits may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches   risk factors related to ownership of our common stock   there is currently no market for our common stock and a market for our common stock may not develop which could adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities   there is no market for our common stock a trading market for our common stock may never develop or if developed it may not be maintained investors may be unable to sell their common stock unless a market can be established and maintained   we have no intention of paying dividends   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain future earnings if any for funding growth and therefore do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future   our common stock may be deemed a “penny stock” which would make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares   our common stock in all likelihood will trade at a price below  per share and become subject to the “penny stock” rules enacted by the sec this would increase the likelihood that many brokerage firms will not participate in a potential future market for our common stock these rules require among other things that brokers who trade penny stock to persons other than “established customers” complete certain documentation make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and as a result the number of brokerdealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited if we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period it could have an adverse effect on the market if any for our securities if our securities are subject to the penny stock rules investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities            we are subject to compliance with securities law which exposes us to potential liabilities including potential rescission rights   in the past our shares of common stock have been offered to prospective investors pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of regulation d promulgated under the securities act of  as amended the “securities act” unless the sale of our common stock otherwise qualifies for the statutory private offering exemption provided in section  of the securities act purchasers of our common stock may have the right to rescind their purchase if any of our offerings fail to comply with the requirements of regulation d a similar right may exist under state securities law if we have used the proceeds raised from any of our offerings prior to the time at which a rescission claim is made there can be no assurance that any funds will be available to return to any investors who may be entitled to the rescission of their purchase of our common stock   the basis for relying on such exemptions is factual that is the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and completing the sales of our common stock pursuant to our various offerings we have not received a legal opinion to the effect that any of our prior offerings were exempt from registration under any federal or state law instead we have relied upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemptions including information provided by investors themselves if any prior offering did not qualify for such exemption we may face claims for rescission and other remedies we may become engaged in costly litigation to defend these claims which would lead to increased expenditures for legal fees and divert management’s attention from operating the business of the company if we could not successfully defend these claims we may be required to return proceeds from our offerings to investors which would harm our financial condition additionally if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which we have relied we may become subject to significant fines and penalties imposed by the sec and state securities agencies   the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management’s attention   we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended exchange act the sarbanesoxley act the doddfrank act and other applicable securities rules and regulations compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources the exchange act requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results on an annual basis we estimate the increased legal costs to be approximately  and financial compliance costs to be approximately    as a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company our business and financial condition will become more visible which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation by third parties if such claims are successful our business and operating results could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results   if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected   as a public company we will be required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls in addition we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley act we are in the process of designing implementing and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation however this process is time consuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section  in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or as an emerging growth company if we utilize the exemption from b or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected if this is the case we could also become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed the securities and exchange commission or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources   the market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance   the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including     ● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results   ● the financial projections we may provide to the public any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections   ● actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors   ● additional shares of our common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders or the anticipation of such sales including if we issue shares to satisfy financial obligations or if existing stockholders sell shares into the market and   ● changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies in our industry lawsuits threatened or filed against us            in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of comparable companies stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in the past stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility if we were to become involved in securities litigation it could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business    we are an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act of  and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors   we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  “jobs act” and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed  billion if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a three year period or if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of any may    our status as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act of  may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it   because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an “emerging growth company” we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it if we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected   item b unresolved staff comments   not applicable   item  properties   the company maintains its corporate headquarters

forwardlooking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions this annual report on form k and other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forwardlooking statements that set out anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions regarding future events or performance we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance in particular these include statements relating to future actions future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts expenses the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results factors that could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to differ materially are set forth in the “risk factors” section of this annual report on form k   we caution that these factors could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements we make and that investors should not place undue reliance on any such forwardlooking statements further any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors further we cannot assess the impact of each such factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k            for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december     the company has had very limited operations for the years ended december   and  with revenues totaling  and  during these periods respectively the company ceased operations in a facility that was being used to conduct exercise classes in october  due to the financial constraints and has since focused on developing dvd and online potential operations while continuing its fundraising efforts accordingly yearoveryear analysis provides limited insight into the company’s operations   total expenses while limited increased sharply in  over  totaling  in  compared to  for the prior year the increase of  was mainly attributable to professional fees relating to the company’s efforts to become current in its public reporting requirements legal fees increased between the periods by  as did accounting and audit related expenses interest expense also increased by approximately  between the periods reflecting the  increase in borrowing via notes payable to related parties absent an equity transaction to provide necessary operating capital increase in debt particularity to related parties can be expected to continue into the foreseeable future   the net loss for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively   liquidity and capital resources   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern for the year ended december   the company had a net loss of  as of december   the company has a working capital deficit of  in view of these matters the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company’s ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability the company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements   as previously mentioned since inception we have financed our operations largely from the sale of common stock and the issuance of notes payable during the year ended december   we did not raise any from the sale of common stock during this period we raised  through the issuance of notes payable the majority of which was used to cover operating expenses and professional services   we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of    we anticipate that cash used in product development and operations especially in the marketing production and sale of our products may increase significantly in the future   we will be dependent upon loans from management and others to finance our planned operations through the next  months we do not have any known requirements for capital expenditures in the coming  months aside from locating and securing a new facility to house our operations we intend to lease desired space for our operation at an unknown rental rate we do not have a commitment for such funds at this time   additional capital may not be available when required or on favorable terms if adequate funds are not available we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain or potential markets either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders   offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors            going concern   the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business   as reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements the company had an accumulated deficit at december   of  and a net loss of  these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   the company is attempting to produce sufficient revenue however the company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations while the company believes in the viability of its strategy to produce sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds   the independent auditors’ audit report accompanying our december   financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business   critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   new accounting pronouncements   for a description of recent accounting standards including the expected dates of adoption and estimated

contain an adverse or a disclaimer of opinion nor were the reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty audit scope or accounting principles except as follows the company’s audited financial

of may              item a controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as that term is defined in rule ae promulgated by the sec pursuant to the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our management with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form k based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to material weaknesses which we identified in our report on internal control over financial reporting   internal control over financial reporting   management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting   our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af under the exchange act our management with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   our management’s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was based on the framework in internal controlintegrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december   under the criteria set forth in the  internal control – integrated framework   the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate   a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis management has determined that material weaknesses exist due to a lack of formalized controls and procedures as well as a lack of segregation of duties as well as the absence of an independent audit committee chair resulting from the company’s limited resources   based on this evaluation our management concluded that as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective   limitations on effectiveness of controls   our principal executive officer and principal financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additional controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected            changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended december   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our

bods transcending company “bodt” on october   bodt was incorporated in the state of florida on september   and was terminated on september   in  the company determined that it no longer needed to continue to operate through a subsidiary and all of its operations were transferred to company   the dance studio opened for business in  and in the years since  we have provided a fitness program for over  clients our fitness program created for women works out “body and mind” elevating the sprit while burning calories our new approach to exercise is to make exercise fun through dance trx training and kickboxing which takes the bore and lack of motivation out of traditional exercising our program creates a style of exercising that captivates our clients in such a way that it keeps them moving while benefiting from the exercise the dance studio closed in november of  the company is currently looking for a new location   note   going concern   the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business   as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the company had an accumulated deficit at december   of  a net loss for the year ended december   of  and net cash used in operating activities of  for the period these conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern   the company is attempting to produce sufficient revenue however the company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations while the company believes in the viability of its strategy to produce sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds   the audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph addressing the existence of substantial doubt concerning the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   note   summary of significant accounting principles   the management of the company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the company’s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below    f        note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   basis of presentation   the company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”   the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its whollyowned subsidiary bodt through december   all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   through the company’s annual report on form k for the years ended december   the company had reported under the guidance of fasb accounting standards codification “asc” topic  development stage entities fasb accounting standards update no  developments stage entities topic  elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including an amendment to variable interest entities guidance in topic  consolidation eliminated the concept of development stage entities and became effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein accordingly the company has ceased reporting as a development stage entity   the company has adopted an annual accounting period of january through december   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured in addition to the aforementioned general policy the following is the specific revenue recognition policy   revenues from the sale of our exercise dance and training programs is recognized when     ● persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists         ● the dance or exercise session has been completed in accordance with the terms of the arrangement         ● the price generally on a per session basis to the customer is fixed and determinable and         ● collectability is reasonably assured   use of estimates and assumptions and critical accounting estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods   critical accounting estimates are estimates for which a the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and b the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material the company’s critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were   i assumption as a going concern management assumes that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business   ii fair value of longlived assets fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value if readily determinable if longlived assets are determined to be recoverable but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated the net book values of the longlived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives the company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events    f        note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   iii valuation allowance for deferred tax assets management assumes that the realization of the company’s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss “nol” carry–forwards for federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly the potential tax benefits of the net loss carryforwards are offset by a full valuation allowance management made this assumption based on a the company has incurred recurring losses b general economic conditions and c the lack of certainty its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering among other factors   iv estimates and assumptions used in valuation of equity instruments significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value   management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources   management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information changes in facts and circumstances historical experience and reasonable assumptions after such evaluations if deemed appropriate those estimates are adjusted accordingly   actual results could differ from those estimates   concentration and credit risk   financial instruments and related items which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash cash equivalents and when present trade receivables the company places its cash and temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions at times such investments may be in excess of the fdic insurance limit   fair value of financial instruments   fasb asc —fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of financial instruments and expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels the three levels of fair value hierarchy defined are as follows     level  quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date   level  pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date   level  pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data   financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable   the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument    f        note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   the carrying amounts of the company’s financial assets and liabilities such as cash accounts receivable prepaid expenses accounts payable and accrued interest – related party approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’slength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated   carrying value recoverability and impairment of longlived assets   the company has adopted asc —property plant and equipment for its longlived assets the company’s longlived assets which include furniture fixtures and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable   the company assesses the recoverability of its longlived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related longlived asset or group of longlived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value if readily determinable if longlived assets are determined to be recoverable but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated the net book values of the longlived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives   the company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events there were no impairment charges recognized for the nine month periods ending december   and  respectively   cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents   property and equipment   property and equipment are recorded at cost expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred depreciation of property and equipment is computed by the straightline method after taking into account their respective estimated residual values over the assets estimated useful lives of five  to seven  years upon sale or retirement of property or equipment the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations   derivative instruments   the company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with accounting standards codification  derivatives and hedging “asc ” which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities they require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value   if certain conditions are met a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of i the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or ii the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change    f        note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   the company has not engaged in any derivative transactions or hedging activities during the years ending december   and  respectively   related parties   the company follows the provisions of asc —related party transactions  disclosures relating to the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions   our financial statements include disclosures of material related party transactions other than compensation arrangements expense allowances and other similar items in the ordinary course of business the disclosures include a the nature of the relationships involved b a description of the transactions including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements c the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period and d amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and if not otherwise apparent the terms and manner of settlement   commitment and contingencies   the company follows the guidance of asc —contingencies when accounting for contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that may be pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses if determinable and material would be disclosed   loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantees would be disclosed management does not believe based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial position and results of operations or cash flows   equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services   the company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under guidance of asc    accordingly all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued whichever is more reliably measurable the measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur    f        note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   deferred tax assets and income tax provision   the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns pursuant to the provisions of asc —income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date   net income loss per common share   basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period diluted net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements such as stock options convertible note shares and warrants   for the years ended december   and  the company had  and  potentially dilutive shares underlying convertible notes outstanding respectively which were not included in our income loss per share calculations as they were antidilutive   subsequent events   the company will evaluate and disclose if indicated subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued pursuant to asu  the company as an sec filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users such as through filing them
