m ii read preview article excerpt the us defense industrial base is undergoing a major transformation domestic political and budget uncertainty geopolitical instability and evolving global threats have all become constants defense spending now stands at the lowest percentage of national gdp in modern history and is in danger of being crowded out by other pressing domestic needs including social programs and the servicing of a growing national debtin an effort to address this effectively and within budget the defense department is continually examining and issuing new and updated directives such as its better buying power initiative this mandate first launched in  and updated most recently as bpp  is the departments effort to increase productivity efficiency and effectiveness of defense acquisition efforts bbp encompasses a set of acquisition principles to achieve greater efficiencies through affordability cost control elimination of unproductive processes and bureaucracy and promotion of competitionmercury systems supports the principles of bbp  addressing firmfixed pricing a redefinition of commercial items and procurement practices that encourage open architectures will help make bbp  a realityfirmfixed pricing contracts shift cost and pricing risk to sellers driving them to innovate and optimize to remain both competitive and profitable while encouraging the defense industrial base to build technology solutions that are standardized modular based on open systems architectures and that leverage reusable technology elements this has become a pressing issue as the department  and companies supporting the platforms and missions that are of national and global importance  need to engage in business practices that can make the model a successin the context of procurement and pricing a commercial item should be defined in terms of which party bore the risk and cost of developing and marketing the technology current defense procurement regulations determine commerdality based on answers to questions such as who else bought it what did they pay what was it derived from how close is it to whats in a catalogthese inquiries are not relevant to effective technology investment decisions or costeffective procurement instead officials should be asking who supplied the investment in rd has the technology provider invested in open systems and modularity and standardization how can these technologies be applied across multiple applications programs and missions and most importantly has there been competition to provide a costeffective solutionuntil this reassessment of commerciality is completed the incentives for industry to shoulder more of the cost of research and development will be weak and the bbp  initiative is unlikely to gain the kind of traction it deservesdirectives aimed at driving open systems architectures in place for over  years have actually discouraged investment in true open systems which are vital to supporting rapid technology development and insertion and affordable upgrades of existing platforms this is in part because the department views open systems architectures as a mechanism to drive down costs not as a means of driving rapid innovation shared standards and the development of preintegrated technology solutions … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and over
