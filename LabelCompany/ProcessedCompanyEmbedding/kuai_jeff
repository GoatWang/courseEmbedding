login sign up about me talk restaurants nightlife home services write a review events talk log in    kukuiula village ala kalanikauamakakoloa hi    we discovered living foods on our first day er first few hours upon arriving in kauai we were staying new poipu beach and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries we feel fortunate to have found this place early on as it provided many meals of healthy fresh foods most it was used for milk for breakfast wines for evenings and salads for dinner one night i had the poke bowl compared to pono market and foodland the poke was too expensive for the price in my honest opinion overall a great find despite prices eeking out at a little too high that being said youre getting quality food on an island so just enjoy your vacation if thats your purpose there and let yourself indulge a bit watch out  watch what the butcher is charging you the main issue i have with this market has been with the butcher department i have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again the first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin bc when i got home and cooked my  pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps not cool but also not a big deal i would hopethink a butcher would know how to cut bacon or at least ask the preference of the cut but she didnt so i remember for the next time the second time i go i get a different but your lady and i asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as i was there describing how thin and uneatable it was instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which wouldve been  to  dollars she charge me for bacon wrapped tenderloin which happened to be  a half a pound after telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price when i refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right  turned out to be  again i tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed this time i got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up  for bacon wrapped tenderloin i immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again but all he said was sorry but that doesnt settle right with menow i know i am not the only person she has done this too esp of this is the second time shes done it to me in a week and a half i cant imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals that is xs what is normally cost now i dont know what living foods mission is but if its stealing from people i will not be shopping there anymore also on a side note you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for for a bell pepper and some strawberries which are on the shelves old completely moldy and bruised you cant sell that nor should it be on your shelves if you want a store that runs on quality dont put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money i am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything i buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality if i do decide to go back yeah okay you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude cranky and clearly very unhappy this place touts itself as believing in living foods but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving we will skip this place in the future there are small local markets with great produce local fish markets and other nicer places to go no aloha attitude here rip off alert im posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning just giving you all a heads up the breakfast sandwich we ordered well it had one egg not two and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised but instead on a white flour hamburger bun that sucker cost us  what we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich just this side of mcdonalds i wouldve returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were  minutes away the roast beef rollup  had almost maybe kinda sorta  oz of roast beef and about  inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off and offers really poor value living in california this is very much like whole foods i am used to their high prices so these prices didnt send me into a frenzy while the prices are a bit high they dont skip a beat on the food everything is to quality and delicious the acai bowls are to die for and a must if you want some good java talk to phil great guy originally from california who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house we had tried several bags around the island before coming here this place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location lots of restaurants boutiques walking distance from a few resorts in the poipu area i also saw a few kauai juices and kombuchas in the fridge section lots of great wines snacks and prepared food to grab and go this place reminded me of a whole foods but on a more local smaller scale i loved all of the all natural local goods here i know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them the cost increases i believe it is worth it i picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut coconut and other oils that smelled amazing this is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too lots of hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other hawaiian spices i also grabbed breakfast to go here i got the breakfast burrito for  it was loaded with veggies eggs and some meat i found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough they do charge an extra  for togo items so be warned i thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home check it out the only reason they get  stars is because its expensive but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes they do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate this market has an amazing food lanai simply named the lanai yet theres nothing simple about their menu we were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar they make the best burger on kauai hands down the high quality beef the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile the appetizers are decent and flavorful id recommend the avocado croquettes with some kona brewery beer amazing breakfast find in a strip mall eggs fresh and creamy toast whole wheat bacon local pigcoffee was nutty and local beans ground to order pleasantly satisfied  thumbs up to living foods market they believe in what they sell and use only localkudos to them this is a nice little health food store in a great location lots of grocery and produce choices with the option of ordering hot food and coffee too the veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious in addition to the moroccan cous cous salad its definitely a little pricey and they charge you  cents each togo box worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if youre not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot this place has so much to offer but if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on hawaii time  be patient go outside to the juice bar and get the green machine or green goodness it is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies ive ever had we came here x for it i also tried one of their poke bowls i love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings it was so tasty wish i had time to come back here for more their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didnt have a chance to try them perfectly cooked bacon reasonably priced excellently spiced breakfast potatoes clever muffin flavors huge egg sandwiches fluffy pancakes  and thats just breakfast they also have the best thin crust pizza their market caters to an international crowd so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as trader joes we come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation great breakfasts we pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes there is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected not creamy at all they taste like instant  dense rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are  bucks major fail on those this place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude the  employees i encountered today were awful first employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms after almost  minutes of standing there being ignored i asked if she could ring me up and she says  i guess so she rings me up and the item is rung up for  more than it was listed for i bring this to her attention and she says if it rings up that price then thats the price that it is i stand my ground and say that its listed on the shelf as  not  another employee again argues with me that im wrong he goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say yes indeed it is marked for  but if you would of read the label thats for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs he had so much attitude and sass in his reply i dont think ive ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots i tell employee that hes so rude and leave ill never go back to this store ive already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food i left and went to kukuiula market where i payed less and was treated with common courtesy i bought here a  mozzarella galbani and when i had it i figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual i checked the package and it was  month expired i went back to the shop and with quite indifference ive been refund of my  i had the feeling it wasnt the first time it happened to them everything about this place screams class and high end food in reality its basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall service is poor and rude a man in front of me in line wasnt understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter  she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all weve had poke for  days straight so i tried it there and its the worst ive had it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest weve had there are so many good places to eat around poipu dont waste your time and money here coolest place ever but expensive great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions fresh fruits nuts and fifty items just about everything you need is here love the deli case and the sandwiches are great on this particular day i had a burger and salad cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun subbed the fries for a side saladvinegarette a a pricy gourmet that makes whole foods seam like a value priced super market the poke bowels were very good for  but the caesar salad for  was not very good the wine selection was ok but overpriced we found a larger selection and better prices at the longs drug store at the other end of this shopping center breakfast pizza breakfast pizza so good this place has it all healthy food good coffee great place wowslowwwwww is the word for the pace here i waited  minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told i had to pay st the cashier first  minutes after coming in im still waiting for my simple blt sandwich i counted  people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers laterthe sandwich arrived and it was reasonably tasty though the  price tag left a bitter after taste i guess this store wants to be a whole paycheck of kauai too not impressed living foods market  cafe claimed this business has been

foods  living foods kauai’s living foods gourmet grocery market with highend chefs    back to gallery as a gourmet grocery market loaded with organic nongenetically modified and other natural foods living foods in kauai’s upscale plantationstyle shops at kukuiula may remind some patrons of whole foods just with wooden floors and even fresher papayas for coowners jeff sacchini and howard warner who moved from northern california to kauai a year ago after buying the store from former san francisco chef jim moffat another comparison may be more apt “i think living foods is unique in and of itself but i would liken it to birite in san francisco” said sacchini a former executive with fresh point the country’s largest produce distributor “they don’t have the kitchen that we do but in terms of the quality focus and the integrity they do nothing comes through our back door unless it’s a real highintegrity product” “birite is just out of this world” agreed warner brother of sacchini’s wife liz and formerly a corporate lawyer who lived in san francisco and later orinda “that type of store is able to get into the community more deeply and we’re small enough that we can get closer to the consumer than whole foods” latest sfgate videos at living foods those consumers are about  percent visitors and  percent locals according to sacchini tourists often discover the grocery market by dining in one of the several shops at kukuiula restaurants run by hawaii celebrity chefs including roy yamaguchi’s new eating house  opened last month “i loved the concept of having a really highend gourmet market focused on mostly organic nongmo foods but with a highend kitchen” said sacchini a half dozen of the store’s chefs bakers and line cooks have culinary training he noted including the head baker a culinary institute of america grad who moved to kauai for its premier scuba diving “we’re really proud of our bakery’s scones danishes and muffins” sacchini said “our flour is made in south san francisco at giusto’s and i won’t compromise on that because it’s regarded as the best flour in the world” the store also serves  prepared salads daily including farmraised organic chicken curry with housemade chutney locally grown kale and local red and gold beets they come from a rotating list of  salads but “people let us know their frustration if we don’t have the kale the chicken or the beets every day” sacchini said the garden isle’s naturally grown fruits and vegetables are also part of the store’s appeal not all are certified organic though for good reasons sacchini said “most are from momandpop type farms where they don’t have the money to get organic certification” he explained “i’ve toured almost all of the farms and they are passionate about highquality products we have a gal who grows sugarloaf pineapple for us in moloaa and she treats them as if they were her own children” living foods in the shops at kukuiula poipu kauai httpshoplivingfoodscom   open  am

issue i have with this market has been with the butcher department i have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again the first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin bc when i got home and cooked my  pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps not cool but also not a big deal i would hopethink a butcher would know how to cut bacon or at least ask the preference of the cut but she didnt so i remember for the next time the second time i go i get a different but your lady and i asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as i was there describing how thin and uneatable it was instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which wouldve been  to  dollars she charge me for bacon wrapped tenderloin which happened to be  a half a pound after telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price when i refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right  turned out to be  again i tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed this time i got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up  for bacon wrapped tenderloin i immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again but all he said was sorry but that doesnt settle right with menow i know i am not the only person she has done this too esp of this is the second time shes done it to me in a week and a half i cant imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals that is xs what is normally cost now i dont know what living foods mission is but if its stealing from people i will not be shopping there anymore also on a side note you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for for a bell pepper and some strawberries which are on the shelves old completely moldy and bruised you cant sell that nor should it be on your shelves if you want a store that runs on quality dont put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money i am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything i buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality if i do decide to go back yeah okay you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude cranky and clearly very unhappy this place touts itself as believing in living foods but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving we will skip this place in the future there are small local markets with great produce local fish markets and other nicer places to go no aloha attitude here rip off alert im posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning just giving you all a heads up the breakfast sandwich we ordered well it had one egg not two and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised but instead on a white flour hamburger bun that sucker cost us  what we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich just this side of mcdonalds i wouldve returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were  minutes away the roast beef rollup  had almost maybe kinda sorta  oz of roast beef and about  inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off and offers really poor value living in california this is very much like whole foods i am used to their high prices so these prices didnt send me into a frenzy while the prices are a bit high they dont skip a beat on the food everything is to quality and delicious the acai bowls are to die for and a must if you want some good java talk to phil great guy originally from california who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house we had tried several bags around the island before coming here this place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location lots of restaurants boutiques walking distance from a few resorts in the poipu area i also saw a few kauai juices and kombuchas in the fridge section lots of great wines snacks and prepared food to grab and go this place reminded me of a whole foods but on a more local smaller scale i loved all of the all natural local goods here i know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them the cost increases i believe it is worth it i picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut coconut and other oils that smelled amazing this is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too lots of hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other hawaiian spices i also grabbed breakfast to go here i got the breakfast burrito for  it was loaded with veggies eggs and some meat i found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough they do charge an extra  for togo items so be warned i thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home check it out the only reason they get  stars is because its expensive but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes they do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate this market has an amazing food lanai simply named the lanai yet theres nothing simple about their menu we were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar they make the best burger on kauai hands down the high quality beef the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile the appetizers are decent and flavorful id recommend the avocado croquettes with some kona brewery beer amazing breakfast find in a strip mall eggs fresh and creamy toast whole wheat bacon local pigcoffee was nutty and local beans ground to order pleasantly satisfied  thumbs up to living foods market they believe in what they sell and use only localkudos to them this is a nice little health food store in a great location lots of grocery and produce choices with the option of ordering hot food and coffee too the veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious in addition to the moroccan cous cous salad its definitely a little pricey and they charge you  cents each togo box worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if youre not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot this place has so much to offer but if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on hawaii time  be patient go outside to the juice bar and get the green machine or green goodness it is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies ive ever had we came here x for it i also tried one of their poke bowls i love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings it was so tasty wish i had time to come back here for more their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didnt have a chance to try them perfectly cooked bacon reasonably priced excellently spiced breakfast potatoes clever muffin flavors huge egg sandwiches fluffy pancakes  and thats just breakfast they also have the best thin crust pizza their market caters to an international crowd so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as trader joes we come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation great breakfasts we pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes there is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected not creamy at all they taste like instant  dense rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are  bucks major fail on those this place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude the  employees i encountered today were awful first employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms after almost  minutes of standing there being ignored i asked if she could ring me up and she says  i guess so she rings me up and the item is rung up for  more than it was listed for i bring this to her attention and she says if it rings up that price then thats the price that it is i stand my ground and say that its listed on the shelf as  not  another employee again argues with me that im wrong he goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say yes indeed it is marked for  but if you would of read the label thats for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs he had so much attitude and sass in his reply i dont think ive ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots i tell employee that hes so rude and leave ill never go back to this store ive already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food i left and went to kukuiula market where i payed less and was treated with common courtesy i bought here a  mozzarella galbani and when i had it i figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual i checked the package and it was  month expired i went back to the shop and with quite indifference ive been refund of my  i had the feeling it wasnt the first time it happened to them everything about this place screams class and high end food in reality its basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall service is poor and rude a man in front of me in line wasnt understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter  she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all weve had poke for  days straight so i tried it there and its the worst ive had it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest weve had there are so many good places to eat around poipu dont waste your time and money here coolest place ever but expensive great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions fresh fruits nuts and fifty items just about everything you need is here love the deli case and the sandwiches are great on this particular day i had a burger and salad cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun subbed the fries for a side saladvinegarette a a pricy gourmet that makes whole foods seam like a value priced super market the poke bowels were very good for  but the caesar salad for  was not very good the wine selection was ok but overpriced we found a larger selection and better prices at the longs drug store at the other end of this shopping center breakfast pizza breakfast pizza so good this place has it all healthy food good coffee great place wowslowwwwww is the word for the pace here i waited  minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told i had to pay st the cashier first  minutes after coming in im still waiting for my simple blt sandwich i counted  people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers laterthe sandwich arrived and it was reasonably tasty though the  price tag left a bitter after taste i guess this store wants

kalanikauamakakoloa hi    we discovered living foods on our first day er first few hours upon arriving in kauai we were staying new poipu beach and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries we feel fortunate to have found this place early on as it provided many meals of healthy fresh foods most it was used for milk for breakfast wines for evenings and salads for dinner one night i had the poke bowl compared to pono market and foodland the poke was too expensive for the price in my honest opinion overall a great find despite prices eeking out at a little too high that being said youre getting quality food on an island so just enjoy your vacation if thats your purpose there and let yourself indulge a bit watch out  watch what the butcher is charging you the main issue i have with this market has been with the butcher department i have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again the first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin bc when i got home and cooked my  pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps not cool but also not a big deal i would hopethink a butcher would know how to cut bacon or at least ask the preference of the cut but she didnt so i remember for the next time the second time i go i get a different but your lady and i asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as i was there describing how thin and uneatable it was instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which wouldve been  to  dollars she charge me for bacon wrapped tenderloin which happened to be  a half a pound after telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price when i refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right  turned out to be  again i tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed this time i got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up  for bacon wrapped tenderloin i immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again but all he said was sorry but that doesnt settle right with menow i know i am not the only person she has done this too esp of this is the second time shes done it to me in a week and a half i cant imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals that is xs what is normally cost now i dont know what living foods mission is but if its stealing from people i will not be shopping there anymore also on a side note you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for for a bell pepper and some strawberries which are on the shelves old completely moldy and bruised you cant sell that nor should it be on your shelves if you want a store that runs on quality dont put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money i am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything i buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality if i do decide to go back yeah okay you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude cranky and clearly very unhappy this place touts itself as believing in living foods but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving we will skip this place in the future there are small local markets with great produce local fish markets and other nicer places to go no aloha attitude here rip off alert im posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning just giving you all a heads up the breakfast sandwich we ordered well it had one egg not two and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised but instead on a white flour hamburger bun that sucker cost us  what we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich just this side of mcdonalds i wouldve returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were  minutes away the roast beef rollup  had almost maybe kinda sorta  oz of roast beef and about  inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off and offers really poor value living in california this is very much like whole foods i am used to their high prices so these prices didnt send me into a frenzy while the prices are a bit high they dont skip a beat on the food everything is to quality and delicious the acai bowls are to die for and a must if you want some good java talk to phil great guy originally from california who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house we had tried several bags around the island before coming here this place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location lots of restaurants boutiques walking distance from a few resorts in the poipu area i also saw a few kauai juices and kombuchas in the fridge section lots of great wines snacks and prepared food to grab and go this place reminded me of a whole foods but on a more local smaller scale i loved all of the all natural local goods here i know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them the cost increases i believe it is worth it i picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut coconut and other oils that smelled amazing this is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too lots of hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other hawaiian spices i also grabbed breakfast to go here i got the breakfast burrito for  it was loaded with veggies eggs and some meat i found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough they do charge an extra  for togo items so be warned i thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home check it out the only reason they get  stars is because its expensive but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes they do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate this market has an amazing food lanai simply named the lanai yet theres nothing simple about their menu we were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar they make the best burger on kauai hands down the high quality beef the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile the appetizers are decent and flavorful id recommend the avocado croquettes with some kona brewery beer amazing breakfast find in a strip mall eggs fresh and creamy toast whole wheat bacon local pigcoffee was nutty and local beans ground to order pleasantly satisfied  thumbs up to living foods market they believe in what they sell and use only localkudos to them this is a nice little health food store in a great location lots of grocery and produce choices with the option of ordering hot food and coffee too the veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious in addition to the moroccan cous cous salad its definitely a little pricey and they charge you  cents each togo box worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if youre not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot this place has so much to offer but if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on hawaii time  be patient go outside to the juice bar and get the green machine or green goodness it is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies ive ever had we came here x for it i also tried one of their poke bowls i love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings it was so tasty wish i had time to come back here for more their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didnt have a chance to try them perfectly cooked bacon reasonably priced excellently spiced breakfast potatoes clever muffin flavors huge egg sandwiches fluffy pancakes  and thats just breakfast they also have the best thin crust pizza their market caters to an international crowd so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as trader joes we come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation great breakfasts we pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes there is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected not creamy at all they taste like instant  dense rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are  bucks major fail on those this place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude the  employees i encountered today were awful first employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms after almost  minutes of standing there being ignored i asked if she could ring me up and she says  i guess so she rings me up and the item is rung up for  more than it was listed for i bring this to her attention and she says if it rings up that price then thats the price that it is i stand my ground and say that its listed on the shelf as  not  another employee again argues with me that im wrong he goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say yes indeed it is marked for  but if you would of read the label thats for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs he had so much attitude and sass in his reply i dont think ive ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots i tell employee that hes so rude and leave ill never go back to this store ive already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food i left and went to kukuiula market where i payed less and was treated with common courtesy i bought here a  mozzarella galbani and when i had it i figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual i checked the package and it was  month expired i went back to the shop and with quite indifference ive been refund of my  i had the feeling it wasnt the first time

photos share review embed review compliment send message follow kim d stop following kim d  we discovered living foods on our first day er first few hours upon arriving in kauai we were staying new poipu beach and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries we feel fortunate to have found this place early on as it provided many meals of healthy fresh foods most it was used for milk for breakfast wines for evenings and salads for dinner one night i had the poke bowl compared to pono market and foodland the poke was too expensive for the price in my honest opinionoverall a great find despite prices eeking out at a little too high that being said youre getting quality food on an island so just enjoy your vacation if thats your purpose there and let yourself indulge a bit was this review … useful funny cool sasha w palo alto ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow sasha w stop following sasha w  watch out watch what the butcher is charging youthe main issue i have with this market has been with the butcher department i have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again the first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin bc when i got home and cooked my  pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps not cool but also not a big deal i would hopethink a butcher would know how to cut bacon or at least ask the preference of the cut but she didnt so i remember for the next time the second time i go i get a different but your lady and i asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as i was there describing how thin and uneatable it was instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which wouldve been  to  dollars she charge me for bacon wrapped tenderloin which happened to be  a half a pound after telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price when i refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right  turned out to be  again i tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed this time i got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up  for bacon wrapped tenderloin i immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again but all he said was sorry but that doesnt settle right with menow i know i am not the only person she has done this too esp of this is the second time shes done it to me in a week and a half i cant imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals that is xs what is normally cost now i dont know what living foods mission is but if its stealing from people i will not be shopping there anymore also on a side note you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for for a bell pepper and some strawberries which are on the shelves old completely moldy and bruised you cant sell that nor should it be on your shelves if you want a store that runs on quality dont put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money  i am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything i buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality if i do decide to go back they hand cut bacon never again they hand cut bacon never again was this review … useful

all healthy food good coffee great place amazing breakfast sandwich burrito and pancakes i could eat here every morning great place to eat or grab a snack i work in the mall and this is one of my favorite places to go for lunch when im in the mood to splurge their pizzas are amazing i usually get the milano or if im in the mood for something healthy ill get the ahi salad my coworkers and i also like to go there for breakfast from time to time because it tastes good and they give pretty big portions its a little pricey but thats to be expected in the poipu area although for the price youre getting a great meal and the staff is always friendly even when its busy definitely recommend went here  days for breakfast you order at the counter and within a few minutes your food arrives at a table outside in their deck half the price of eating at any resort and twice the quality lemon pancakes pineapple french toast and ham and cheese crepe all great even though it was out of our way we ended up going here for lunch twice because we liked their sandwiches and poke bowls so much they had lots of options for my gluten and dairy free wife one day we ordered sandwiches to go and brought them along on our hike they also have lots of good grocery items so we stocked up on goat cheese and other snacks to bring back to our bb this place was our goto stop throughout our entire trip while incredibly expensive what isnt in hawaii though it was absolutely delicious i ordered a poke bowl one day and it was excellent it was very fresh and beautifully prepared i also had the acai bowl at least twice  also very good best coffee i had in kauai came back for breakfast and it was delicious such a cute cafe thats primarily organic which is always a plus enjoyed our breakfast outside which was very lovely the girl that helped us was so sweet and the market had great options  though expensive but the cafe is worth it a little pricy but if youre looking for high quality goods from the mainland then its great we needed up at the local farmers market mostly for comparable produce amazing market with local offerings came here every morning for breakfast during vacation because their options were better than anything at our hotel the tasty coffee is roasted in house and they even have a juice bar for healthy juices smoothies and acai bowls this place reminded me of a whole foods but on a more local smaller scale i loved all of the all natural local goods here i know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them the cost increases i believe it is worth it i picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut coconut and other oils that smelled amazing this is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too lots of hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other hawaiian spices i also grabbed breakfast to go here i got the breakfast burrito for  it was loaded with veggies eggs and some meat i found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough they do charge an extra  for togo items so be warned i thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home check it out perfectly cooked bacon reasonably priced excellently spiced breakfast potatoes clever muffin flavors huge egg sandwiches fluffy pancakes  and thats just breakfast they also have the best thin crust pizza their market caters to an international crowd so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as trader joes coolest place ever but expensive great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions fresh fruits nuts and fifty items just about everything you need is here love the deli case and the sandwiches are great on this particular day i had a burger and salad cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun subbed the fries for a side saladvinegarette a i love this sweet little market and juice bar for a natural healthy breakfast or lunch they make the most beautiful and delicious pitaya bowls and smoothies ive ever had great sandwiches burgers and wraps jeff sachinniowner is the man  ive tried four meals breakfast pizza rustic egg italian sandwich and grab and go turkey sandwich and i have not been let down once amazing pizza great market probably the best woodfired pizza on the island pizzas are small and are  so you may need to order a couple just ate lunch here and had the best savory crepe i have ever had i got the roasted veggie  delicious and very tasty good selection for vegetarians overall a review long overdue living foods is the ultimate caterer on kauai i was back today planning our next corporate event the exclusive dinner prepared for our team in the national tropical botanical garden was off the charts the food was the quality of the greatest restaurants and they know wine supervised by the owners this experience was first class our executive team and top producers experienced an incredible evening from champagne on the beach to an exceptional meal prepared

hi    this place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude the  employees i encountered today were awful first employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms after almost  minutes of standing there being ignored i asked if she could ring me up and she says  i guess so she rings me up and the item is rung up for  more than it was listed for i bring this to her attention and she says if it rings up that price then thats the price that it is i stand my ground and say that its listed on the shelf as  not  another employee again argues with me that im wrong he goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say yes indeed it is marked for  but if you would of read the label thats for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs he had so much attitude and sass in his reply i dont think ive ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots i tell employee that hes so rude and leave ill never go back to this store ive already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food i left and went to kukuiula market where i payed less and was treated with common courtesy i bought here a  mozzarella galbani and when i had it i figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual i checked the package and it was  month expired i went back to the shop and with quite indifference ive been refund of my  i had the feeling it wasnt the first time it happened to them everything about this place screams class and high end food in reality its basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall service is poor and rude a man in front of me in line wasnt understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter  she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all weve had poke for  days straight so i tried it there and its the worst ive had it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest weve had there are so many good places to eat around poipu dont waste your time and money here yeah okay you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude cranky and clearly very unhappy this place touts itself as believing in living foods but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving we will skip this place in the future there are small local markets with great produce local fish markets and other nicer places to go no aloha attitude here rip off alert im posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning just giving you all a heads up the breakfast sandwich we ordered well it had one egg not two and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised but instead on a white flour hamburger bun that sucker cost us  what we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich just this side of mcdonalds i wouldve returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were  minutes away the roast beef rollup  had almost maybe kinda sorta  oz of roast beef and about  inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off and offers really poor value over priced if you are going to pay  for a deli sandwich it should be the best instead it seems they put as little of each ingredient as possible what a let down living foods offers poke bowls this was the worst poke bowl i have ever had it was  rice and mayo horrible not even worth  star ordered a burger to go got home and found out the patty was the size of a silver dollar came with a little lettuce and the butt end of a tomato  the place is pretentious unorganized staff are rudeno training total rip off this was the worst meal i had while staying on the island and the worst service i have had as well actually this is the worst service i have had any restaurant in as long as i can remember i ordered blue berry ricotta pancakes with bacon i ordered the bacon extra crispy as i am pregnant the bacon came out and it was not crispy at all let alone extra crispy to make a long story short i had to ask  times to have my bacon exchanged for extra crispy after over an hour of waiting and the  times asked they brought me bacon that looked exactly the same as the original bacon i couldnt eat in and couldnt bear to ask again so no bacon for this pregnant woman i was happy to find such market in poipu but my happiness turned sour when meeting the cashier she was grumpy and sarcastic im asian maybe she doesnt like my kind poor service very slow tomake food charges for to go boxes what next napkins and cups are a charge too had to wait extra long for an attitude to make  little pizzas when there wasnt anyone else before us dont recommend sitting here drinking our not mochas made by a woman who we overheard admit to her coworker that shes screwing up after making our coffees ordering the coffee was painful as the woman had a frown when i ordered one soy mocha and one  mocha she looked at me as though i had made a mistake but no thats actually what i wanted meanwhile my husband was waiting to be helped  feet away at the deli counter there were no other customers anywhere near the deli but the two workers there just stared at my husband without approaching him if youre looking for a store with good vegan options and friendly service please go elsewhere if youre looking for overpriced goods with sour service youve found the place rude rude rude people working here especially the old guy behind counter and the snippety young girl with dark hair tried twice second time the managers all talking in front of liquor and would not move and would not come to front to ring up iiquor for the minor cashier out of towners stay away whalers market down the street so much nicer people and cheaper your see the cashier to order food will make this business a failure there were at least  visible staff members and one person being helpedi gave up on ordering the brisket panini as a loyal whole foods customer when not on vacation i was excited to visit this store because it seemed right up my alley i did really like looking around and appreciated their selection overpriced like all groceries in hawaii but even more sountil i interacted with the staff they were rude and very unaccomodating i placed an order for french fries minutes before am and they told me they couldnt serve me until after am because they only were serving breakfast with a hungry kiddo with me i wanted food asap so i ordered bfast potatoes i asked if they would bring them to us on the patio  feet away or if i had to wait for them inside they said i had to come get them when i came back to check on our food a few minutes later the  staff members i asked about the potatoes were standing around laughing and chatting together with only  other customers in the whole store and many other staff i was shocked they werent willing to stop chatting to bring us the potatoes since they had seen me juggling a young child groceries and a huge diaper bag i can say the breakfast potatoes were pretty good and the kale salad we got from their prepared foods section was decent their roasted beets with goat cheese also from the prepared foods section were not good and had eactly two pieces of goat cheese we did not go back sad whole foods ripoff that doesnt even halfway do it justice we stopped in tonight to grab din i ordered the falafel wrap and a side of fries how can you possibly eff up a falafel wrap ask the two incompetent chefs working the kitchen at  pm on  the falafel wrap was dry loaded with harissa and sautéed veggies faijitastyle the two flavors clashed and ruined the wrap it needed tzatziki sauce badly so dry actually ive never had a falafel wrap without it major miss the fries were ok btw they were out of ketchup so i notified one of the chefs he simply looked up at me for a sec and then proceeded with what he was doing not a word a minute later another chef walked up the first chef said theres no more ketchup the second chef shouted across the counter to the coffee shop and said brian youre out of ketchup brian then proceeded to scrape the remaining ketchup off of a plastic container he retrieved from the back of the kitchen taking care of the customer these  guys so rude even mcdonalds treats customers and their requests more respectfully save yourself some time groceries are overpriced so if you can drive over to sueokas market the food is not worth what youll get charged for it and the service is horrible go to koloa deli or brick oven pizza where youll get amazing food and equally amazing customer service the breakfast sandwich was rubbish burnt breakfast potatoes egg must have hit the pan running and the bacon was like rubber just saw someone else throw his in the trash overpriced rubbish very expensive grocery about three times the prices of other grocery stores for the same brand ever have one of those experiences that just standout as so unbelievable well this was one of those for me the deli food looked great but getting someone to help was impossible i made the mistake of asking the pizza cook if i was in the right place to order and he went out of his way to make sure i knew how insulted he was that i spoke to him too bad cuz its a very convenient location with some unique foods and wine high prices and low customer service im sorry that i can give living foods just one star only because i will give it  stars for being outrageously expensive great establishment to walk around and peruse the aislesbut not someplace that you could frequent often love their peanut butter cookiesill splurge on one for  i live about  mile from here  while it certainly has the fanciest stuff around in their deli etc  the prices make it prohibitive for the vast majority of residents to go here i have had lunch there  times with friends visiting here and while the food is good the prices are just too much a good place if your wallet is fat living foods market  cafe claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a

later another chef walked up the first chef said theres no more ketchup the second chef shouted across the counter to the coffee shop and said brian youre out of ketchup brian then proceeded to scrape the remaining ketchup off of a plastic container he retrieved from the back of the kitchen taking care of the customer these  guys so rude even mcdonalds treats customers and their requests more

talk log in    kukuiula village ala kalanikauamakakoloa hi    we discovered living foods on our first day er first few hours upon arriving in kauai we were staying new poipu beach and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries we feel fortunate to have found this place early on as it provided many meals of healthy fresh foods most it was used for milk for breakfast wines for evenings and salads for dinner one night i had the poke bowl compared to pono market and foodland the poke was too expensive for the price in my honest opinion overall a great find despite prices eeking out at a little too high that being said youre getting quality food on an island so just enjoy your vacation if thats your purpose there and let yourself indulge a bit watch out  watch what the butcher is charging you the main issue i have with this market has been with the butcher department i have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again the first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin bc when i got home and cooked my  pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps not cool but also not a big deal i would hopethink a butcher would know how to cut bacon or at least ask the preference of the cut but she didnt so i remember for the next time the second time i go i get a different but your lady and i asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as i was there describing how thin and uneatable it was instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which wouldve been  to  dollars she charge me for bacon wrapped tenderloin which happened to be  a half a pound after telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price when i refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right  turned out to be  again i tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed this time i got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up  for bacon wrapped tenderloin i immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again but all he said was sorry but that doesnt settle right with menow i know i am not the only person she has done this too esp of this is the second time shes done it to me in a week and a half i cant imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals that is xs what is normally cost now i dont know what living foods mission is but if its stealing from people i will not be shopping there anymore also on a side note you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for for a bell pepper and some strawberries which are on the shelves old completely moldy and bruised you cant sell that nor should it be on your shelves if you want a store that runs on quality dont put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money i am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything i buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality if i do decide to go back yeah okay you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude cranky and clearly very unhappy this place touts itself as believing in living foods but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving we will skip this place in the future there are small local markets with great produce local fish markets and other nicer places to go no aloha attitude here rip off alert im posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning just giving you all a heads up the breakfast sandwich we ordered well it had one egg not two and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised but instead on a white flour hamburger bun that sucker cost us  what we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich just this side of mcdonalds i wouldve returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were  minutes away the roast beef rollup  had almost maybe kinda sorta  oz of roast beef and about  inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off and offers really poor value living in california this is very much like whole foods i am used to their high prices so these prices didnt send me into a frenzy while the prices are a bit high they dont skip a beat on the food everything is to quality and delicious the acai bowls are to die for and a must if you want some good java talk to phil great guy originally from california who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house we had tried several bags around the island before coming here this place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location lots of restaurants boutiques walking distance from a few resorts in the poipu area i also saw a few kauai juices and kombuchas in the fridge section lots of great wines snacks and prepared food to grab and go this place reminded me of a whole foods but on a more local smaller scale i loved all of the all natural local goods here i know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them the cost increases i believe it is worth it i picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut coconut and other oils that smelled amazing this is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too lots of hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other hawaiian spices i also grabbed breakfast to go here i got the breakfast burrito for  it was loaded with veggies eggs and some meat i found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough they do charge an extra  for togo items so be warned i thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home check it out the only reason they get  stars is because its expensive but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes they do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate this market has an amazing food lanai simply named the lanai yet theres nothing simple about their menu we were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar they make the best burger on kauai hands down the high quality beef the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile the appetizers are decent and flavorful id recommend the avocado croquettes with some kona brewery beer amazing breakfast find in a strip mall eggs fresh and creamy toast whole wheat bacon local pigcoffee was nutty and local beans ground to order pleasantly satisfied  thumbs up to living foods market they believe in what they sell and use only localkudos to them this is a nice little health food store in a great location lots of grocery and produce choices with the option of ordering hot food and coffee too the veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious in addition to the moroccan cous cous salad its definitely a little pricey and they charge you  cents each togo box worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if youre not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot this place has so much to offer but if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on hawaii time  be patient go outside to the juice bar and get the green machine or green goodness it is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies ive ever had we came here x for it i also tried one of their poke bowls i love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings it was so tasty wish i had time to come back here for more their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didnt have a chance to try them perfectly cooked bacon reasonably priced excellently spiced breakfast potatoes clever muffin flavors huge egg sandwiches fluffy pancakes  and thats just breakfast they also have the best thin crust pizza their market caters to an international crowd so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as trader joes we come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation great breakfasts we pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes there is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected not creamy at all they taste like instant  dense rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are  bucks major fail on those i bought here a  mozzarella galbani and when i had it i figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual i checked the package and it was  month expired i went back to the shop and with quite indifference ive been refund of my  i had the feeling it wasnt the first time it happened to them everything about this place screams class and high end food in reality its basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall service is poor and rude a man in front of me in line wasnt understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter  she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all weve had poke for  days straight so i tried it there and its the worst ive had it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest weve had there are so many good places to eat around poipu dont waste your time and money here coolest place ever but expensive great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions fresh fruits nuts and fifty items just about everything you need is here love the deli case and the sandwiches are great on this particular day i had a burger and salad cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun subbed the fries for a side saladvinegarette a a pricy gourmet that makes whole foods seam like a value priced super market the poke bowels were very good for  but the caesar salad for  was not very good the wine selection was ok but overpriced we found a larger selection and better prices at the longs drug store at the other end of this shopping center breakfast pizza breakfast pizza so good this place has it all healthy food good coffee great place wowslowwwwww is the word for the pace here i waited  minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told i had to pay st the cashier first  minutes after coming in im still waiting for my simple blt sandwich i counted  people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers laterthe sandwich arrived and it was reasonably tasty though the  price tag left a bitter after taste i guess this store wants to be a whole paycheck of kauai too not impressed living foods market  cafe claimed this business has been claimed by the owner

for nothing special and their employees are so rude  the  employees i encountered today were awful  first employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms after almost  minutes of standing there being ignored  i asked if she could ring me up and she says  i guess so  she rings me up and the item is rung up for  more than it was listed for i bring this to her attention and she says if it rings up that price then thats the price that it is i stand my ground and say that its listed on the shelf as  not  another employee again argues with me that im wrong he goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say yes indeed it is marked for  but if you would of read the label thats for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs  he had so much attitude and sass in his reply  i dont think ive ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect  instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots i tell employee that hes so rude and leave ill never go back to this store ive already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or

review events talk log in    kukuiula village ala kalanikauamakakoloa hi    we discovered living foods on our first day er first few hours upon arriving in kauai we were staying new poipu beach and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries we feel fortunate to have found this place early on as it provided many meals of healthy fresh foods most it was used for milk for breakfast wines for evenings and salads for dinner one night i had the poke bowl compared to pono market and foodland the poke was too expensive for the price in my honest opinion overall a great find despite prices eeking out at a little too high that being said youre getting quality food on an island so just enjoy your vacation if thats your purpose there and let yourself indulge a bit yeah okay you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude cranky and clearly very unhappy this place touts itself as believing in living foods but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving we will skip this place in the future there are small local markets with great produce local fish markets and other nicer places to go no aloha attitude here rip off alert im posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning just giving you all a heads up the breakfast sandwich we ordered well it had one egg not two and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised but instead on a white flour hamburger bun that sucker cost us  what we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich just this side of mcdonalds i wouldve returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were  minutes away the roast beef rollup  had almost maybe kinda sorta  oz of roast beef and about  inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off and offers really poor value living in california this is very much like whole foods i am used to their high prices so these prices didnt send me into a frenzy while the prices are a bit high they dont skip a beat on the food everything is to quality and delicious the acai bowls are to die for and a must if you want some good java talk to phil great guy originally from california who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house we had tried several bags around the island before coming here this place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location lots of restaurants boutiques walking distance from a few resorts in the poipu area i also saw a few kauai juices and kombuchas in the fridge section lots of great wines snacks and prepared food to grab and go this place reminded me of a whole foods but on a more local smaller scale i loved all of the all natural local goods here i know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them the cost increases i believe it is worth it i picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut coconut and other oils that smelled amazing this is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too lots of hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other hawaiian spices i also grabbed breakfast to go here i got the breakfast burrito for  it was loaded with veggies eggs and some meat i found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough they do charge an extra  for togo items so be warned i thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home check it out the only reason they get  stars is because its expensive but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes they do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate this market has an amazing food lanai simply named the lanai yet theres nothing simple about their menu we were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar they make the best burger on kauai hands down the high quality beef the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile the appetizers are decent and flavorful id recommend the avocado croquettes with some kona brewery beer amazing breakfast find in a strip mall eggs fresh and creamy toast whole wheat bacon local pigcoffee was nutty and local beans ground to order pleasantly satisfied  thumbs up to living foods market they believe in what they sell and use only localkudos to them this is a nice little health food store in a great location lots of grocery and produce choices with the option of ordering hot food and coffee too the veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious in addition to the moroccan cous cous salad its definitely a little pricey and they charge you  cents each togo box worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if youre not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot this place has so much to offer but if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on hawaii time  be patient go outside to the juice bar and get the green machine or green goodness it is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies ive ever had we came here x for it i also tried one of their poke bowls i love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings it was so tasty wish i had time to come back here for more their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didnt have a chance to try them perfectly cooked bacon reasonably priced excellently spiced breakfast potatoes clever muffin flavors huge egg sandwiches fluffy pancakes  and thats just breakfast they also have the best thin crust pizza their market caters to an international crowd so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as trader joes we come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation great breakfasts we pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes there is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected not creamy at all they taste like instant  dense rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are  bucks major fail on those this place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude the  employees i encountered today were awful first employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms after almost  minutes of standing there being ignored i asked if she could ring me up and she says  i guess so she rings me up and the item is rung up for  more than it was listed for i bring this to her attention and she says if it rings up that price then thats the price that it is i stand my ground and say that its listed on the shelf as  not  another employee again argues with me that im wrong he goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say yes indeed it is marked for  but if you would of read the label thats for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs he had so much attitude and sass in his reply i dont think ive ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots i tell employee that hes so rude and leave ill never go back to this store ive already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food i left and went to kukuiula market where i payed less and was treated with common courtesy i bought here a  mozzarella galbani and when i had it i figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual i checked the package and it was  month expired i went back to the shop and with quite indifference ive been refund of my  i had the feeling it wasnt the first time it happened to them everything about this place screams class and high end food in reality its basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall service is poor and rude a man in front of me in line wasnt understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter  she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all weve had poke for  days straight so i tried it there and its the worst ive had it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest weve had there are so many good places to eat around poipu dont waste your time and money here coolest place ever but expensive great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions fresh fruits nuts and fifty items just about everything you need is here love the deli case and the sandwiches are great on this particular day i had a burger and salad cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun subbed the fries for a side saladvinegarette a a pricy gourmet that makes whole foods seam like a value priced super market the poke bowels were very good for  but the caesar salad for  was not very good the wine selection was ok but overpriced we found a larger selection and better prices at the longs drug store at the other end of this shopping center breakfast pizza breakfast pizza so good this place has it all healthy food good coffee great place wowslowwwwww is the word for the pace here i waited  minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told i had to pay st the cashier first  minutes after coming in im still waiting for my simple blt sandwich i counted  people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers laterthe sandwich arrived and it was reasonably tasty though the  price tag left a bitter after taste i guess this store wants to be a whole paycheck of kauai too not impressed living foods market  cafe claimed this business has been

watch out watch what the butcher is charging youthe main issue i have with this market has been with the butcher department i have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again the first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin bc when i got home and cooked my  pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps not cool but also not a big deal i would hopethink a butcher would know how to cut bacon or at least ask the preference of the cut but she didnt so i remember for the next time the second time i go i get a different but your lady and i asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as i was there describing how thin and uneatable it was instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which wouldve been  to  dollars she charge me for bacon wrapped tenderloin which happened to be  a half a pound after telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price when i refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right  turned out to be  again i tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed this time i got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up  for bacon wrapped tenderloin i immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again but all he said was sorry but that doesnt settle right with menow i know i am not the only person she has done this too esp of this is the second time shes done it to me in a week and a half i cant imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals that is xs what is normally cost now i dont know what living foods mission is but if its stealing from people i will not be shopping there anymore also on a side note you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for for a bell pepper and some strawberries which are on the shelves old completely moldy and bruised you cant sell that nor should it be on your shelves if you want a store that runs on quality dont put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money  i am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything i buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality if i do decide to go back they hand cut bacon never again they hand cut bacon never

bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals that is xs what is normally cost now i dont know what living foods mission is but if its stealing from people i will not be shopping there anymore also on a side note you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for for a bell pepper and some strawberries which are on the shelves old completely moldy and bruised you cant sell that nor should it be on your shelves if you want a store that runs on quality dont put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money i am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything i buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality if i do decide to go back yeah okay you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude cranky and clearly very unhappy this place touts itself as believing in living foods but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving we will skip this place in the future there are small local markets with great produce local fish markets and other nicer places to go no aloha attitude here rip off alert im posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning just giving you all a heads up the breakfast sandwich we ordered well it had one egg not two and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised but instead on a white flour hamburger bun that sucker cost us  what we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich just this side of mcdonalds i wouldve returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were  minutes away the roast beef rollup  had almost maybe kinda sorta  oz of roast beef and about  inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off and offers really poor value living in california this is very much like whole foods i am used to their high prices so these prices didnt send me into a frenzy while the prices are a bit high they dont skip a beat on the food everything is to quality and delicious the acai bowls are to die for and a must if you want some good java talk to phil great guy originally from california who hooked us up with some awesome local coffee to make at our beach house we had tried several bags around the island before coming here this place is pricey but it has good vibes and is in a great location lots of restaurants boutiques walking distance from a few resorts in the poipu area i also saw a few kauai juices and kombuchas in the fridge section lots of great wines snacks and prepared food to grab and go this place reminded me of a whole foods but on a more local smaller scale i loved all of the all natural local goods here i know when you are buying natural ingredients or goods made with them the cost increases i believe it is worth it i picked up some body butters made with macadamia nut coconut and other oils that smelled amazing this is a really great place to buy that gourmet foodie some gifts too lots of hawaiian sea salts to choose from as well as other hawaiian spices i also grabbed breakfast to go here i got the breakfast burrito for  it was loaded with veggies eggs and some meat i found it a little bland even with the salsa but tasty enough they do charge an extra  for togo items so be warned i thought this was a great place to pick up some local specialty goods to bring back home check it out the only reason they get  stars is because its expensive but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes they do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate amazing breakfast find in a strip mall eggs fresh and creamy toast whole wheat bacon local pigcoffee was nutty and local beans ground to order pleasantly satisfied  thumbs up to living foods market they believe in what they sell and use only localkudos to them this is a nice little health food store in a great location lots of grocery and produce choices with the option of ordering hot food and coffee too the veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious in addition to the moroccan cous cous salad its definitely a little pricey and they charge you  cents each togo box worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if youre not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot this place has so much to offer but if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on hawaii time  be patient go outside to the juice bar and get the green machine or green goodness it is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies ive ever had we came here x for it i also tried one of their poke bowls i love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings it was so tasty wish i had time to come back here for more their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didnt have a chance to try them perfectly cooked bacon reasonably priced excellently spiced breakfast potatoes clever muffin flavors huge egg sandwiches fluffy pancakes  and thats just breakfast they also have the best thin crust pizza their market caters to an international crowd so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as trader joes we come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation great breakfasts we pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes there is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected not creamy at all they taste like instant  dense rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are  bucks major fail on those this place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude the  employees i encountered today were awful first employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms after almost  minutes of standing there being ignored i asked if she could ring me up and she says  i guess so she rings me up and the item is rung up for  more than it was listed for i bring this to her attention and she says if it rings up that price then thats the price that it is i stand my ground and say that its listed on the shelf as  not  another employee again argues with me that im wrong he goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say yes indeed it is marked for  but if you would of read the label thats for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs he had so much attitude and sass in his reply i dont think ive ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots i tell employee that hes so rude and leave ill never go back to this store ive already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food i left and went to kukuiula market where i payed less and was treated with common courtesy i bought here a  mozzarella galbani and when i had it i figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual i checked the package and it was  month expired i went back to the shop and with quite indifference ive been refund of my  i had the feeling it wasnt the first time it happened to them everything about this place screams class and high end food in reality its basically and airport kiosk in a high end mall service is poor and rude a man in front of me in line wasnt understanding the answer to a question he asked the woman working the counter  she was curt and may no attempt to be pleasant at all weve had poke for  days straight so i tried it there and its the worst ive had it was hard to find the ahi among the other added ingredients and it was the priciest weve had there are so many good places to eat around poipu dont waste your time and money here coolest place ever but expensive great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions fresh fruits nuts and fifty items just about everything you need is here love the deli case and the sandwiches are great on this particular day i had a burger and salad cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun subbed the fries for a side saladvinegarette a a pricy gourmet that makes whole foods seam like a value priced super market the poke bowels were very good for  but the caesar salad for  was not very good the wine selection was ok but overpriced we found a larger selection and better prices at the longs drug store at the other end of this shopping center breakfast pizza breakfast pizza so good this place has it all healthy food good coffee great place wowslowwwwww is the word for the pace here i waited  minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told i had to pay st the cashier first  minutes after coming in im still waiting for my simple blt sandwich i counted  people behind the counter all of whom are busy doing something other then helping customers laterthe sandwich arrived and it was reasonably tasty though the  price tag left a bitter after taste i guess this store wants to be a whole paycheck of kauai too not impressed living foods market  cafe claimed this business has been

they get  stars is because its expensive but the lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world and my husband downed the breakfast pizza before finishing my large stack of pancakes they do serve hefty portions so two could definitely share one plate this market has an amazing food lanai simply named the lanai yet theres nothing simple about their menu we were blown away by the amazing offerings and ample bar they make the best burger on kauai hands down the high quality beef the caramelized onions and bacon chutney sauce create an awesome flavor profile the appetizers are decent and flavorful id recommend the avocado croquettes with some kona brewery beer amazing breakfast find in a strip mall eggs fresh and creamy toast whole wheat bacon local pigcoffee was nutty and local beans ground to order pleasantly satisfied  thumbs up to living foods market they believe in what they sell and use only localkudos to them this is a nice little health food store in a great location lots of grocery and produce choices with the option of ordering hot food and coffee too the veggie sandwich from the deli is delicious in addition to the moroccan cous cous salad its definitely a little pricey and they charge you  cents each togo box worth it though because they are open later than many other places and if youre not in the mood for fine dining this place will hit the spot this place has so much to offer but if you are coming to get prepared food just remember that they operate on hawaii time  be patient go outside to the juice bar and get the green machine or green goodness it is packed with healthy stuff and is one of the tastiest green smoothies ive ever had we came here x for it i also tried one of their poke bowls i love that they let you customize the rice and the toppings it was so tasty wish i had time to come back here for more their other prepared foods also looked delicious but we didnt have a chance to try them perfectly cooked bacon reasonably priced excellently spiced breakfast potatoes clever muffin flavors huge egg sandwiches fluffy pancakes  and thats just breakfast they also have the best thin crust pizza their market caters to an international crowd so it stocks almost as many unique products per square foot as trader joes we come here for breakfast frequently when on vacation great breakfasts we pretty much like all the breakfast items on the menu except the lemon ricotta pancakes there is barely a hint of lemon and no ricotta detected not creamy at all they taste like instant  dense rubbery drypancakes you would make from box mixed pancakes except they are  bucks major fail on those this place is so overpriced for nothing special and their employees are so rude the  employees i encountered today were awful first employee kept me waiting at checkout while another customer took his time filling out sandwich order forms after almost  minutes of standing there being ignored i asked if she could ring me up and she says  i guess so she rings me up and the item is rung up for  more than it was listed for i bring this to her attention and she says if it rings up that price then thats the price that it is i stand my ground and say that its listed on the shelf as  not  another employee again argues with me that im wrong he goes to check the price on the shelf and comes back to say yes indeed it is marked for  but if you would of read the label thats for the turkey dogs not the veggie dogs he had so much attitude and sass in his reply i dont think ive ever been spoken to by a store associate with so much disrespect instead of telling them that maybe they need to make sure they stick the correct items in the correct spots i tell employee that hes so rude and leave ill never go back to this store ive already told my family and friends who all had similar stories of impolite employees or mediocre to bad food i left and went to kukuiula market where i payed less and was treated with common courtesy i bought here a  mozzarella galbani and when i had it i figured out in a second that the texture and taste was unusual i checked the package and it was  month expired i went back to the shop and with quite

so many good places to eat around poipu dont waste your time and money here coolest place ever but expensive great choices for wine and spirits as well as lotions fresh fruits nuts and fifty items just about everything you need is here love the deli case and the sandwiches are great on this particular day i had a burger and salad cooked perfect on a lightly grilled bun subbed the fries for a side saladvinegarette a a pricy gourmet that makes whole foods seam like a value priced super market the poke bowels were very good for  but the caesar salad for  was not very good the wine selection was ok but overpriced we found a larger selection and better prices at the longs drug store at the other end of this shopping center breakfast pizza breakfast pizza so good this place has it all healthy food good coffee great place wowslowwwwww is the word for the pace here i waited  minutes in line to order a sandwich only to be told i had to pay st the cashier first  minutes after coming in

francisco ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow kim d stop following kim d  we discovered living foods on our first day er first few hours upon arriving in kauai we were staying new poipu beach and set on a walk to find the best place to buy groceries we feel fortunate to have found this place early on as it provided many meals of healthy fresh foods most it was used for milk for breakfast wines for evenings and salads for dinner one night i had the poke bowl compared to pono market and foodland the poke was too expensive for the price in my honest opinionoverall a great find despite prices eeking out at a little too high that being said youre getting quality food on an island so just enjoy your vacation if thats your purpose there and let yourself indulge a bit was this review … useful funny cool sasha w palo alto ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow sasha w stop following sasha w  watch out watch what the butcher is charging youthe main issue i have with this market has been with the butcher department i have gone there to get bacon three separate times which make me rethink ever buying anything from them again the first time went fine but the butcher lady cut my bacon way too thin bc when i got home and cooked my  pound bacon it cooked into little burnt crisps not cool but also not a big deal i would hopethink a butcher would know how to cut bacon or at least ask the preference of the cut but she didnt so i remember for the next time the second time i go i get a different but your lady and i asked her to cut it a little thicker then the last time as i was there describing how thin and uneatable it was instead of ringing me up for a regular half pound of bacon which wouldve been  to  dollars she charge me for bacon wrapped tenderloin which happened to be  a half a pound after telling her she had rang it up wrong she told me three separate times that it was right and then that was the right price when i refused to pay that price she miraculously found the right number for the bacon and rang me up right  turned out to be  again i tried to go back this week for a third time and had it happen to me a second time from the same woman being over changed this time i got a pound of regular bacon and she rings me up  for bacon wrapped tenderloin i immediately went to the cashier and had him fix it for me without having to go through her again but all he said was sorry but that doesnt settle right with menow i know i am not the only person she has done this too esp of this is the second time shes done it to me in a week and a half i cant imagine the tourist that walk in there looking for fresh cut bacon and get gypped for four times the price not even knowing or other locals that is xs what is normally cost now i dont know what living foods mission is but if its stealing from people i will not be shopping there anymore also on a side note you guys should really look that the produce you are selling for for a bell pepper and some strawberries which are on the shelves old completely moldy and bruised you cant sell that nor should it be on your shelves if you want a store that runs on quality dont put out shit quality stuff out for a shit ton of money  i am over all disappointed with my experience there and will be double checking and making sure everything i buy from their meat and produce department is priced correctly and of adequate quality if i do decide to go back they hand cut bacon never again they hand cut bacon never again was this review … useful  funny cool k h bend or  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow k h stop following k h  yeah okay you can get beautiful sandwiches and pickled mango and chopped up veggies and artisan cheeses but is it really worth it to deal with people who without exception are rude cranky and clearly very unhappy this place touts itself as believing in living foods but what about the living attitudes of the workers who deal with the people they are actually serving we will skip this place in the future there are small local markets with great produce local fish markets and other nicer places to go no aloha attitude hererip off alert im posting this several hours after we purchased lunch and breakfast food to go this morning just giving you all a heads up the breakfast sandwich we ordered well it had one egg not two and was not served on a brioche roll as advertised but instead on a white flour hamburger bun that sucker cost us  what we actually ended up with was a breakfast sandwich  just this side of mcdonalds i wouldve returned it but by the time we opened it to eat we were  minutes awaythe roast beef rollup  had almost maybe kinda sorta  oz of roast beef and about  inches of lettuce and was really dry and tasteless thus place is a clearly a tourist rip off and offers really poor value was this review … useful
