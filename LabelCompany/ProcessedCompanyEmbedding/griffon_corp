corporation  references  external links historyedit founding and early years –edit in  long island businessman helmuth w waldorf – a tool and die maker’s apprentice who had immigrated to the united states from germany to study at columbia university – founded a small defense electronics company in college point queens that was initially named waldorf controls corporation but changed its name later that year to instrument systems corporation isc in  isc issued shares to the public and bolstered its fledgling avionics business by acquiring telephonics corporation established in december  telephonics was among a handful of aviation electronics pioneers that formed the nucleus of the aviation and defense industry on long island during the midth century although highly regarded for its products isc struggled financially in its early years to reposition the company for future growth iscs major stakeholders including waldorf and director lester avnet the president of avnet electronics corporation turned to a highly regarded former executive at loral corporation edward garrett edward j garrett era –edit edward garrett was named chairman and president of isc in  following a strategy that had proved successful at loral garrett transformed isc by closing deficitridden plants seeking civilian markets as well as government researchanddevelopment contracts and acquiring a wide array of young growthoriented companies mainly in defense and commercial electronics and manufacturing in  garrett brought in his soninlaw harvey blau a former assistant us attorney for the southern district of new york as general counsel to help navigate legal issues and close transactions isc purchased  companies in  alone ranking second in acquisitions nationwide that year as investor appetite for corporate conglomerates reached its peak that year isc listed its stock on the american stock exchange which was then home to many fastgrowing companies iscs subsidiaries operated plants throughout the united states and canada producing electronic devices special purpose trucks hardware tools batteries furniture decorative glassware plastic packaging calculators and data processors and sheetmetal building products among others isc’s biggest contracts of the garrett era exemplified the companys continued ability to leverage innovative technologies it had developed for military or government purposes and apply them to civilian use for example after successfully producing communications systems for the us military telephonics won multiyear contracts to produce multiplex passenger entertainment systems for the new boeing  and lockheed l widebody airplanes garrett’s aggressive strategy grew isc at an astonishing rate transforming it from a struggling small electronics company to a nationally recognized industrial conglomerate in less than a decade net sales increased from  million in  to  million in  and total assets from  million to  million in the same period in  isc was listed for the first time on the prestigious fortune  list of america’s largest companies as the s progressed however garrett’s strategy faced stiff headwinds conglomerates had fallen out of favor with investors who preferred companies to focus on a single industry and with the nixon administration which was concerned about mass layoffs after acquisitions as the vietnam war winded down us defense spending also started to decrease the first and second oil crises as well as the recessions of – and the early s further diminished iscs prospects as a result of these macroeconomic developments and the divestiture of underperforming divisions iscs revenues fell from  million in  to  million in  – the year garrett died at age  harvey r blau era –edit following edward garrett’s death in  harvey blau was named chairman of the board and ceo blau moved isc from the brink of not surviving” back on a profitable footing by accelerating garretts divestiture and costcutting plan and selling iscs window lighting and metal casting operations the new leadership also improved the company’s finances by raising capital via a rights offering to existing shareholders boosting shareholder equity from  million to  million and reducing longterm debt “what we have left is what we want and it’s profitable” blau told shareholders in  iscs subsidiaries also successfully secured new business telephonics received orders to develop components for the central integrated test system of rockwell internationals bb bomber communications and radio control systems for lockheed sa aircraft and sikorsky sh seahawk lamps mk iii helicopters and a new advanced audio communications system for nasas space shuttle orbiter spaceplane in addition to strengthening iscs existing lines of business blau pursued a priceconscious acquisition strategy and reestablished a conglomerate structure by purchasing undervalued growthoriented companies in unrelated industry sectors in order to diversify iscs source of revenue and earnings in  isc acquired troubled clothing manufacturer oneita knitting mills inc for  million blau and his team renamed the company oneita industries restructured its finances and grew it to the country’s thirdlargest maker of specialty tshirts tripling sales to  million within a few years isc took oneita public in  selling  percent of shares for about  million and had divested the remainder of the company by  the purchase of clopay corporation in  for  million represented iscs most successful diversification effort under blau founded as a paper wholesaler in  this cincinnatibased company started to produce window coverings during world war ii and subsequently changed its name to clopay a portmanteau of cloth and paper clopay entered the plastic film and garage door business in  and  respectively it was these two divisions that would become key elements of iscs growth in the s and s by building longterm relationships with key strategic business partners isc built clopay into the leading manufacturer of residential garage doors in the united states and one of the leading suppliers of plastic films for diapers surgical gowns and drapes in  clopay accounted for  percent of iscs  million operating income although blau had transformed isc into a streamlined holding company with three thriving core businesses – plastics garage doors and electronics – within a decade wall street hadnt noticed were very frustrated that we havent gotten our story across blau stated at the time to raise iscs profile blau moved the companys stock from the american stock

founding and early years –edit in  long island businessman helmuth w waldorf – a tool and die maker’s apprentice who had immigrated to the united states from germany to study at columbia university – founded a small defense electronics company in college point queens that was initially named waldorf controls corporation but changed its name later that year to instrument systems corporation isc in  isc issued shares to the public and bolstered its fledgling avionics business by acquiring telephonics corporation established in december  telephonics was among a handful of aviation electronics pioneers that formed the nucleus of the aviation and defense industry on long island during the midth century although highly regarded for its products isc struggled financially in its early years to reposition the company for future growth iscs major stakeholders including waldorf and director lester avnet the president of avnet electronics corporation turned to a highly regarded former executive at loral corporation edward garrett edward j garrett era –edit edward garrett was named chairman and president of isc in  following a strategy that had proved successful at loral garrett transformed isc by closing deficitridden plants seeking civilian markets as well as government researchanddevelopment contracts and acquiring a wide array of young growthoriented companies mainly in defense and commercial electronics and manufacturing in  garrett brought in his soninlaw harvey blau a former assistant us attorney for the southern district of new york as general counsel to help navigate legal issues and close transactions isc purchased  companies in  alone ranking second in acquisitions nationwide that year as investor appetite for corporate conglomerates reached its peak that year isc listed its stock on the american stock exchange which was then home to many fastgrowing companies iscs subsidiaries operated plants throughout the united states and canada producing electronic devices special purpose trucks hardware tools batteries furniture decorative glassware plastic packaging calculators and data processors and sheetmetal building products among others isc’s biggest contracts of the garrett era exemplified the companys continued ability to leverage innovative technologies it had developed for military or government purposes and apply them to civilian use for example after successfully producing communications systems for the us military telephonics won multiyear contracts to produce multiplex passenger entertainment systems for the new boeing  and lockheed l widebody airplanes garrett’s aggressive strategy grew isc at an astonishing rate transforming it from a struggling small electronics company to a nationally recognized industrial conglomerate in less than a decade net sales increased from  million in  to  million in  and total assets from  million to  million in the same period in  isc was listed for the first time on the prestigious fortune  list of america’s largest companies as the s progressed however garrett’s strategy faced stiff headwinds conglomerates had fallen out of favor with investors who preferred companies to focus on a single industry and with the nixon administration which was concerned about mass layoffs after acquisitions as the vietnam war winded down us defense spending also started to decrease the first and second oil crises as well as the recessions of – and the early s further diminished iscs prospects as a result of these macroeconomic developments and the divestiture of underperforming divisions iscs revenues fell from  million in  to  million in  – the year garrett died at age  harvey r blau era –edit following edward garrett’s death in  harvey blau was named chairman of the board and ceo blau moved isc from the brink of not surviving” back on a profitable footing by accelerating garretts divestiture and costcutting plan and selling iscs window lighting and metal casting operations the new leadership also improved the company’s finances by raising capital via a rights offering to existing shareholders boosting shareholder equity from  million to  million and reducing longterm debt “what we have left is what we want and it’s profitable” blau told shareholders in  iscs subsidiaries also successfully secured new business telephonics received orders to develop components for the central integrated test system of rockwell internationals bb bomber communications and radio control systems for lockheed sa aircraft and sikorsky sh seahawk lamps mk iii helicopters and a new advanced audio communications system for nasas space shuttle orbiter spaceplane in addition to strengthening iscs existing lines of business blau pursued a priceconscious acquisition strategy and reestablished a conglomerate structure by purchasing undervalued growthoriented companies in unrelated industry sectors in order to diversify iscs source of revenue and earnings in  isc acquired troubled clothing manufacturer oneita knitting mills inc for  million blau and his team renamed the company oneita industries restructured its finances and grew it to the country’s thirdlargest maker of specialty tshirts tripling sales to  million within a few years isc took oneita public in  selling  percent of shares for about  million and had divested the remainder of the company by  the purchase of clopay corporation in  for  million represented iscs most successful diversification effort under blau founded as a paper wholesaler in  this cincinnatibased company started to produce window coverings during world war ii and subsequently changed its name to clopay a portmanteau of cloth and paper clopay entered the plastic film and garage door business in  and  respectively it was these two divisions that would become key elements of iscs growth in the s and s by building longterm relationships with key strategic business partners isc built clopay into the leading manufacturer of residential garage doors in the united states and one of the leading suppliers of plastic films for diapers surgical gowns and drapes in  clopay accounted for  percent of iscs  million operating income although blau had transformed isc into a streamlined holding company with three thriving core businesses – plastics garage doors and electronics – within a decade wall street hadnt noticed were
