spelled jacques davy du perron he is never referred to as davy and he usually signs his documents du perron the spelling duperron is almost certainly wrong his father julien was a physician who on embracing the doctrines of the reformation became a protestant minister his mother was ursine le cointe daughter of guillaume le cointe sieur de tot et d héranville en cotenin during the siege of rouen in  by the troops of king charles ix julien his father was arrested and imprisoned in old palais in rouen ursine and her two children escaped through the royal lines and eventually was reunited

bartholomews day massacre august –  in paris and a month later in normandy the family fled to the island of jersey which was under protestant english control career under henri iiiedit returning to normandy du perrons existence and his talents were drawn to the attention of a courtier who was visiting general jacques of matignon the governor of normandy this courtier named lancosme took du perron along with him when he returned to blois where the new king henri iii was residing he was presented to the king one evening during dinner where he acquitted himself well both in speaking and in answering questions posed by the kings attendants after he had abjured protestantism by  probably he was again presented by philippe desportes abbot of tiron as a young man without equal for knowledge and talent he was appointed reader to the king by henri iii lecteur de la chambre du roy0 in  he is also mentioned as professeur du roy aux langues aux mathematiques et en la philosophie he was commanded to preach before the king at the convent of vincennes  when the success of his sermon on the love of god and of a funeral oration on the poet ronsard on february   after dinner induced him to take orders on the death of mary queen of scots february   he was chosen by the king to compose a poem in her honor and about her fate career under henri ivedit on the death of henry iii august   after having supported for some time the cardinal de bourbon the head of the league against the king du perron eventually became a faithful servant of henry iv on february  0 however he found himself compelled to write directly to the king begging him not to believe the many calumnies of him being spread about by his enemies on december   du perron was appointed by the king bishop of évreux the pope finally approved of the appointment at a consistory on monday december   he was finally consecrated in rome on december   by cardinal françois de joyeuse the coconsecrators were archbishop guillaume davançon of embrun and anne descars de givry bishop of lisieux on november   he was one of those who attended the assemblée des notables at rouen he and marechal de matignon represented normandy in the third chamber he instructed henry in the catholic religion and in  was sent to rome with secretary denissimon de marquemont where with the help of abbé arnaud dossat –0 later cardinal dossat 0 they obtained henrys absolution from the status of relapsed heretic0 du perron and dossat performed the act of abjuration of henris heresy on the steps of st peters basilica on september   thereby ending six years of controversy over the status of france and its king in the eyes of the papacy he departed rome on march   on his return to his diocese du perrons zeal and eloquence were largely instrumental in withstanding the progress of calvinism and among others he converted henry sponde who became bishop of pamiers and the swiss general sancy at the conference at fontainebleau in  he argued with much eloquence and ingenuity against du plessis mornay – cardinal du perronedit on june  0 the bishop of évreux was created a cardinal by pope clement viii at the request of king henri iv in a letter of june  0 king henri iv was able to inform the bishop that the pope had indeed named him a cardinal his red had was bestowed personally by the king in a public assembly at fontainebleau his speech of thanks to the king on that occasion survives he then set out for rome to partake in the ceremonies of his elevation he was sent to rome departing fontainebleau on october  0 as chargé daffaires de france his instructions from henri iv required him to hold conversations with the duke of savoy and the duke of tuscany along the way he and the grand duke discussed among other things possible candidates for the papacy in the next conclave most especially the greatgrand nephew of leo x cardinal alessandro de medici archbishop of florence and bishop of palestrina cardinal demedici was well known in the french court since he had been legatus a latere in france  henry also sent along general instructions for the french cardinals in rome anticipating a vacancy in the papal throne cardinal du perron made his solemn entry into rome on december  in the consistory of january  0 he was named cardinal priest of the church of s agnese in agone in the piazza navona not the current baroque church which was not begun until  immediately upon his appointment clement viii found important work for du perron in rome the pope had formed a special commission the congregation de auxiliis the chairmanship of which he retained for himself but he appointed cardinal du perron to the congregation the purpose of this commission was to investigate and decide upon the work of the jesuit theologian luis de molina which had raised the acute question of gods providence and human free will du perron attended his first session on january  when clement viii died on thursday march  0 the congregation was suspended and du perron found himself involved in his first conclave although he was not the leader of the french faction he contributed loyally after the failure of the candidacies of cardinals baronius and seraphin to the election of the kings candidate cardinal de medici leo xi to the papal throne0 du perron sent off a long letter to henri iv reporting the daytoday movements inside the conclave in great detail on the death of leo xi only twentyfour days later du perron participated in the election of cardinal camillo borghese as paul v at the conclusion of the coronation festivities cardinal du perron wrote a report of the conclave for henri iv after his election paul v decided to continue the congregation de auxiliis and therefore du perron was one of the judges who began meeting again on september  0 he complained in a letter to henri iv that he was constrained to read everything that had been published on the question during the previous eight or nine years although he appeared to work well with cardinal robert bellarmine sj in presenting the positions of molinism fairly du perrons repeated counsel was not to take any decisions on the basic issues of the matter du perron after all had strong augustinian tendencies which tended to make molinas positions uncongenial even when he had returned to france in 0 the jesuits kept attempting to draw him into their circle but without success but while du perron was still in rome pope paul v decided to pick a quarrel with the serene republic of venice over its conduct in exercising its sovereign rights the venetian government had passed a law against alienation of property in favor of the church and another requiring governmental approval for the building of new churches in addition there was the very old argument over the exemption of the clergy from civil court jurisdiction on april  0 pope paul launched a bull against venice imposing an interdict on all the territories belonging to the serenissima this was certain to lead to war and would very likely excite the greed of spain for additional territory in lombardy king henri iv wishing to prevent this proposed mediation between the pope and venice and offered cardinal de joyeuse and cardinal du perron as mediators the status of the jesuits who supported the papal interdict became the main sticking point the venetians wanted them gone finally due to the forceful persuasion of cardinal de joyeuse du perron claimed to be ill the pope gave way the edict was withdrawn and the crisis averted nonetheless for the work that he had done the republic offered du perron its thanks in 0 while still in rome du perron was appointed archbishop of sens by the king an act approved by pope paul v in consistory on october  0 like his predecessor at sens he became primate of the gauls and germany and grand almoner of the king of france which also made him president of the bibliothèque du roi which at that time was located at fontainebleau he was also ex officio the director of the college royal the king also appointed him commander of the order of the holy spirit du perron began his return to france in the autumn of 0 he was received by the grand duke of tuscany in florence who wrote to king henri in praise of du perron on september  he visited cardinal giustiniani in bologna and then went to venice from which he wrote to the king on october  he then passed on toward france by way of milan after his return from rome he was present continually at the royal court for more than a year he did not take possession of his throne in the cathedral of sens until october  0 after the death of henry iv in 0 he took an active part in the statesgeneral of  when he vigorously upheld the ultramontane doctrines against the third estate he died on wednesday september   at the age of  his viscera were entombed in the jesuit church of saintlouis in paris while his body was buried in the
