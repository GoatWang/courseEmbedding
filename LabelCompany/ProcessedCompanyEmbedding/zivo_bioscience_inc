general we were incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on march   under the name of l peck enterprises inc on may   we changed our name to western glory hole inc  from  until october  we had no business operations we were in the development stage and were seeking profitable business opportunities  on october   we acquired  of the outstanding shares of health enhancement corporation hec in exchange for  of our shares making hec our whollyowned subsidiary in connection with this transaction we changed our name to health enhancement products inc  on october   at the annual meeting of the shareholders of the company a proposal was passed to change the name of the company from health enhancement products inc to zivo bioscience inc zivo on october   the financial industry regulatory authority finra approved the name zivo bioscience inc for trading purposes and the symbol change to zivo effective november   we acquired hec in  because we believed its unique and complex algal culture produced natural bioactive compounds that promoted health benefits a production facility based in scottsdale az produced and marketed a liquid dietary supplement with marginal success beginning in  until sales were suspended in january of  our new management team in place since december  determined the sole focus for the near term was to move forward with a researchbased product development program  from  through  we engaged fully in such activities all as more fully explained herein  we are implementing a business model in which we would derive future income from licensing and selling natural bioactive ingredients that may be derived from or are initially based on the algae cultures we expect that these planned new products will likely be sold to much larger betterfinanced animal food dietary supplement and medical food manufacturers  the anticipated income streams are to be generated from a royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients and b bulk sales of such ingredients these bulk ingredients will likely be made by contracted ingredient manufacturers and then sold by us to animal food dietary supplement and medical food processors andor namebrand marketers further we expect to license our bioactive molecules as lead compounds or templates for synthetic variants intended for therapeutic applications in january  we established hepi pharmaceuticals inc as our wholly owned subsidiary hepi pharma the purpose of hepi pharma was to develop potential pharmaceutical applications for the bioactive ingredients that may be derived from our algae cultures in february  we formed zivo biologic inc a delaware corporation for the purpose of manufacturing and commercialization of proprietary ingredients for nonmedicinal animal health applications zivo biologic is  owned by zivo bioscience inc in august  we acquired the assets consisting primarily of intellectual property rights of wellness indicators inc wellness a michigan corporation based in illinois  concurrently we formed wellmetris llc wellmetris as a  owned entity of zivo we acquired four patent applications as part of the transaction in addition to engineering drawings prototypes chemical formulae validation data laboratory equipment and it equipment  we assigned all of the intellectual property acquired to wellmetris with a stated value of  the mission of wellmetris is to develop manufacture market and sell wellness tests the wellness tests are intended to provide individuals the information and opportunity to optimize their health and identify future health risks or to provide insurers employers and healthcare providers timely information to intervene with wellness programs fitness regimes or other preventative measures during the period of time since we have owned wellmetris we have filed  drafted an additional eight patent applications around the intellectual property acquired as noted in the section patents and proprietary rights in the summer of  we evaluated the circumstances related to the original four patent applications acquired and determined that that two of the existing patent applications could be improved and filed new patents applications to redefine and better protect our intellectual property than the original purchased patent applications  we have abandoned one of the initial four patent applications purchased released two of the four applications purchased and substituted them with two new patent applications and retained ownership of one of the four applications purchased which has now converted to a national phase application  in connection with the abandoned patents we have protected our rights with regards to the original patent applications purchased however we determined we should record a loss on abandonment of  for the year ended december   as the initial value of the acquired patent applications pending resides in the newly filed  drafted eight patent applications  marketing and sales zivo algal products  derivatives the marketing and sale of all future products is subject to compliance with applicable regulations based on the findings from ongoing research we intend to approach potential customers or licensees in the following market verticals  the products described throughout this document are still in the development stage and subject to development risk  there can be no assurance that any of the products described below will prove to be effective or if found to be effective will be able to be produced in a commercially viable manner animal nutrition and health a  pilot study in dairy cows indicated that our algal culture may be effective in fending off the onset or significantly reducing symptoms of bovine mastitis  a condition that effectively stops milk production according to the national mastitis council the condition affects  of the us dairy herd at any one time costing producers approximately  per case in the us alone production losses are nearly  billion mycoplasma bovis causes a highly contagious and potentially fatal form of bovine mastitis an infection of the mammary gland for which there currently is no treatment  in the cows udder mammary epithelial cells form an immunological barrier to protect the mammary gland  when bacteria or other pathogens break through this barrier an infection sets in affecting quality and quantity of milk produced   our compounds showed promising early results for restoration of the immunological barrier in experiments conducted in vitro  as conducted by the principal researcher at the university of wisconsin  madison department of dairy science on december   we entered into a collaboration and option agreement agreement with zoetis a global animal health company in connection with the prevention treatment and management of bovine mastitis  in the agreement we granted to the counterparty an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive license with us  specifically upon completion of a collaborative study which is in process and will be completed upon adequate funding the agreement provides for a  day exclusivity period for evaluation of results and based on the counterpartys desire for an exclusive license thereto  days to conclude an exclusive license agreement with respect to livestock and poultry applications we intend to move on three related fronts  working to bring an algal feed ingredient to market in the united states by amplifying the algae culture working to produce a dietary supplement or feed additive for global consumption outside the us and putting ourselves in a position to license the isolated bioactive molecules to a pharmaceutical or drug development company for synthetic development as a prescribed drug for production animal applications  the isolated bioactive molecules form the intellectual property of interest to zoetis the feed ingredient feed additive and dietary supplement are intended for other potential collaborators the veterinarian who conducted the initial dairy cow in vivo study believes that the same autoimmune effect may be useful in combating bovine respiratory disease complex brdc also known as shipping fever brdc typically occurs when beef cattle are shipped from the ranch to the feedlot prior to processing according to the american association of beef producers cattle ranchers and feedlot operators attribute a  loss in body weight to brdc when it occurs  a  billion problem in the us alone we are planning a field study to validate several dosing modalities before offering a licensing option a  pilot study in dogs indicated that our algal culture may be effective in relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis and soreness from overexertion that same experiment with our amplified algae culture can be repeated in dogs which if successful could allow a relatively rapid release to production and sales as a companion animal dietary supplement according to the nutrition business journal the canine jointhealth dietary supplement market segment tops  million annually in the us alone estimates for the world market may be substantially higher but such estimates are difficult to obtain an in vitro tissue explant experiment conducted by the comparative orthopaedics laboratory at university of missouri found that direct stimulation of living canine joint tissue with our bioactive compounds protected cartilage from degradation by ilb an inflammatory cytokine if our product is proven to be effective in vivo and can be produced on an efficient basis we intend to sell or license our product as a supplement ingredient to larger wellestablished and profitable brand names in the pet industry  we have conducted other laboratory studies simulating the effects of canine osteoarthritis with positive results  with all of the above the isolated bioactive molecules found in the amplified algae product may subject to successful negotiations be licensed to a pharmaceutical company for development as a synthetic prescription drug we expect that the process of developing and testing such a drug could take years  therefore as is common practice we intend to work toward negotiating a reasonable upfront licensing fee milestone payments upon each successful conclusion of a development phase followed by premarket approval and finally a steady stream of royalties in the future the other revenue streams generated by feed and supplement sales may begin to be realized in late  or early  but no assurance can be provided in that regard much of the research and licensing progress has been and will continue to be paced by the availability of capital funding andor debt financing see item   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources functional food ingredient according to nutraingredientsusa functional foods or health foods represent an estimated  billion business in the us and a  billion business in europe the middle east although significantly smaller is growing at a rate of  annually followed closely by the newlyaffluent in china and india these foods typically are processed products that contain one or more staple foods augmented with a variety of performanceenhancing ingredients we intend to enter the food market with a healthy cholesterol and healthy immune response ingredient if and when the efficacy of our product can be demonstrated and it clears necessary regulatory hurdles the timeframe is difficult to predict because of capital funding issues dietary supplement  nutraceutical the success of spirulina algae dried kelp omega fish oil resveratrol saw palmetto and similar supplements attests to the american publics obsession with natural products the dietary supplement business is a  billion industry in the us alone and twice that the world over rather than attempting to market a potential cholesterol related bioactive as a branded nutraceutical or supplement we will endeavor to privatelabel the compound or finished product for larger established marketers and retailers if we are able to accomplish this we believe this is a more efficient use of capital and resources while still retaining control of the intellectual property the manufacturing process and pricing decisions we do not intend to be placed in a position where our premier product application is commoditized and we must compete on price medicinal food doctors prescribe medicinal foods prior to during or after various medical procedures including surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy and physical therapy at times medicinal foods are used to augment the effects of prescription drugs these medicinal foods are expensive and typically reimbursed by health insurers we believe that this area has potential for us if we can demonstrate that various properties of the algal extract can be isolated and produced as a medicinal food or beverage prescribed by physicians this is an fdaregulated sector but the standards are less stringent than pharmaceutical applications  once again under our new business model if we are able to produce a commercial product in this area we will endeavor to enter into a privatelabel arrangement with a larger strategic partner to produce and distribute this product application pharmaceuticals we believe that we may be able to pursue prescription drug applications for our product however the process for developing a new prescription drug is costly complex and timeconsuming it is an undertaking well beyond our current financial capabilities and one that may take years to achieve if we pursue the development of a prescription drug we will likely seek a partnership with a codeveloper that will share in the risk and expense of the initial development process and then share in any royalties resulting from the licensing or sale of any synthetic molecule and its homologs we are able to develop and license the first such step was the execution of the bovine mastitis collaboration and option agreement with zoetis part of our business plan is to execute agreements that may ultimately result in option payments licenses fees and royalty payments across animal and human applications  wellmetris wellmetris was formed for the purpose of developing manufacturing marketing and selling tests that we believe will allow individuals and their care providers to optimize personal health and identify future health risks  the information obtained will also provide insurers employers and healthcare providers timely information to intervene with wellness programs fitness regimes or other preventative measures  we plan to develop and commercialize such tests in three phases · in phase one phase one or alternately named gen  we plan to develop and commercialize a series of tests which are intended to measure indicators of good health and optimal metabolic function collectively the phase one test  the phase one test is being designed to measure biomarkers related to oxidative stress inflammation and antioxidant status to establish a metabolic assessment from which intervention can commence and from which metabolic syndrome can be inferred · in phase two phase two or alternately named gen  we plan to develop and commercialize a testing technology focused on the positive or negative metabolic effects of metabolizing fat and muscle efficiency due to changes in diet exertion hydration and dietary supplements in a selfadministered format that integrates with smartphone operating systems · in phase three phase three or alternately named gen  we plan to develop and commercialize additional tests intended to provide a more complete metabolic profile for an individual utilizing the metabolites present in urine   the company believes the gen  tests in aggregate will allow identification of healthy versus unhealthy bodily processes in realtime this technology can also be applied to livestock and companion animals as capital funding becomes available the company will move forward with finalizing its transition cow syndrome test for which a provisional patent application has already been filed we are currently in phase one of development as described above we believe there is a viable market for our wellness tests  more than  of americans are afflicted with cardiovascular diseases diabetes autoimmune diseases and cancer   the wellness tests are intended to identify preconditions to such illnesses  such identification may allow for early intervention and reduce incidence of such illnesses or forestall their onset  this is critically important to large employers insurers and governmental agencies who are payers for health claims and are facing massive increases in premiums or cash outlays the wellmetris technology also incorporates sophisticated software to analyze report record and manage wellness and health data for large groups such as large employers pension funds accountable care organizations state medicaid agencies and their actuarial consultants underwriters reinsurers and wellness consultants the software also contains tools to conduct metaanalysis of baseline health benchmarks and monitor the progress of preclinical intervention programs within large groups due to funding issues all development work has been halted until this entity is either sold funded independently of zivo bioscience or spun out as a freestanding business corporate

supplements and functional food ingredients such as vitamins omega and antioxidants are made and marketed in a fiercely competitive pricesensitive market environment recently several algae producers have made health claims for their proprietary algae strains ranging from treatment for diabetes to controlling hiv symptoms proprietary products offered by some marketers are often dogged by unsubstantiated claims of product efficacy or present potential product safety issues which in turn draw the attention of regulators the optimal position for a supplement and ingredient maker is when pricing power can be exerted through wellprotected intellectual property and further backed by welldocumented safety and efficacy claims  we believe that our primary competition will come from innovators in food technology such as dsmmartek cognis conagra cargill and nestle each of which has active ma efforts a large scientific staff and a generous rd budget to develop supplements and ingredients for a wide range of applications however we intend to approach these very same competitors as potential strategic partners in order to leverage their specific expertise in certain food and supplement categories where a mutually beneficial relationship can be established  there can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective with respect to animal health the companion animal dietary supplement segment and specifically canine joint health is made up almost exclusively of chondroitinglutathione supplements which have dominated that segment for more than a decade this  million segment represents a potentially lucrative opportunity to introduce a completely new product if we are able to demonstrate superior benefits and produce a product at a comparable price further the animal health market as it pertains to mastitis in dairy cows and specifically feed ingredients that exhibit beneficial properties has been largely in the realm of yeastbased products only recently has there been a focus on algaebased alternatives as promoted by alltech with its  million expansion of an algae facility in kentucky in the us feed ingredients cannot be promoted using any form of health claim and dietary supplements for production animals are to our knowledge nonexistent however outside the us the use of dietary supplements is widespread and we intend to market our refined ingredients to a worldwide market in partnership with a global brand name wellmetris the biomedical and biotech fields are fiercely competitive many of the wellness tests available to the healthcare consumer or provider are not necessarily accurate nor reliable because some do not take into account urine concentration as normalized by creatinine or specific gravity which changes markedly throughout the day bloodbased wellness tests can be even less reliable because the biomarkers for oxidative stress and inflammation are extremely dynamic and will often change before the blood can be tested casting doubt on the results although we are not aware that competitors or competing products have entered the market recently there is no guarantee that our products will be proven to be effective and commercially viable or that a larger betterfinanced competitor may not emerge once we begin promoting our products   raw materials zivo algal products  derivatives we produce our microbial mixture using third party facilities at the close of  we contracted synthetic genomics inc to conduct commercial scaleup at a facility in imperial valley california we continue to use the azcati facility at arizona state university to produce our microbial mixture for continued experimentation wellmetris in tandem with seeking regulatory approval we will need two physical components to deliver our services  a dedicated custom reader device and a test comprised of eight  different chemistry tests on a single urine test panel housed in a proprietary disposable cartridge

regulations for foods as well as the provisions of the food safety modernization act of  which require all companies involved in the production of food and food ingredients to develop and implement a hazard analysis and critical control point haccp program the dietary supplement health and education act of  dshea revised the provisions of the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca by recognizing dietary supplements as a distinct category of food and we believe is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry  the legislation grandfathered with some limitations dietary ingredients that were on the market before october    a dietary supplement that contains a dietary ingredient that was not on the market before october   will require evidence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that it is reasonably expected to be safe  to the extent that we offer for sale unique proprietary ingredients we will be required to file with fda evidence supporting the conclusion that we have a reasonable expectation that they will be safe for human consumption when used as directed  the fda recently published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which the nutraceutical industry believes will substantially increase the level of evidence required to satisfy the reasonable expectation standard dshea provides for specific nutritional labeling requirements for dietary supplements  dshea permits substantiated truthful and nonmisleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling such as statements describing general wellbeing from consumption of a nutraceutical ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining structure or function of the body  a company making a statement of nutritional support must possess adequate substantiating scientific evidence for the statement disclose on the label that the fda has not reviewed the statement and that the product is not intended to mitigate treat cure or prevent disease and notify the fda of the statement within  days after its initial use  to the extent we produce finished product for use by consumers as nutraceuticals we will be required to comply with these provisions of dshea labeling and advertising regulations we may market one or more of our products as a conventional food or for use as an ingredient in conventional foods  within the us this category of products is subject to the nutrition labeling and education act nlea and regulations promulgated under the nlea the nlea regulates health claims ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in the product the ingredients added to conventional foods must either be generally recognized as safe by experts gras or be approved as food additives under fda regulations the ftc which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of our product has for years instituted enforcement actions against companies marketing supplements for alleged false misleading or unsubstantiated advertising of some of their products  the ftc has specific guides for advertising claim substantiation as well as for the use of testimonials  as a general matter companies making health related claims for their products or ingredients are required to possess well designed human clinical studies supporting such claims at the time they are made  enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and significant monetary payments by the companies involved in addition the ftc has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials which we have and may in the future utilize  international regulations of our products in many foreign markets in which we may choose to offer our products for sale we may be required to obtain an approval license or certification from the relevant countrys ministry of health or comparable agency  this would hold true for jurisdictions such as canada the european union japan australia and new zealand  the approval process generally requires us to present each product and product ingredient to appropriate regulators for review of data supporting safety as well as substantiating any claims we may desire to make we would also be required to comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country our failure to comply with these regulations could prevent our products from being legally offered for sale   california proposition  californias safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of  also known as proposition  provides that no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly discharge or release a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity into water or into land where such chemical passes or probably will pass into any source of drinking water without first giving clear and reasonable warning  among other things the statute covers all consumer goods including foods sold in the state of california prop  allows private enforcement actions sometimes called bounty hunter actions  reports indicate that over  such actions have been commenced annually over the past  years against companies in the nutraceutical industry eg lead content of calcium lead content of ginseng pcb in fish oil alleging that their products are contaminated with heavy metals or other compounds that would trigger the warning requirements of the act  while we intend to take appropriate steps to ensure that any of our products that we may market will be in compliance with the act given the nature of this statute and the extremely low tolerance limits it establishes well below federal requirements there is a risk that we our contracted producer or a licensee could be found liable for the presence of miniscule amounts of a prohibited chemical in our product  such liability could be significant general to the extent dictated by our research partners we will produce researchonly feedstock for chemical analysis safety studies and efficacy studies compliant with applicable state and federal regulations however we will rely on our research partners to conduct their respective rd programs in a manner compliant with applicable regulation and law once a product concept has been fully developed we intend to manufacture that product either internally or on a contract basis in either case we intend to adhere to all state and federal regulations relative to the safety and efficacy of the product application as well as relevant regulations covering the safe and consistent manufacture of that product compliance in fall of  we accelerated our efforts to achieve gras generally recognized as safe status for the algal biomass intended for use in humans poultry dogs and cattle we contracted a wellregarded fda consultant to map out the strategy and manage the process of developing product specifications safety testing publication of results and convening a gras panel for human use in late  as a result of a binding letter of intent with nutriquest an animal nutrition company based in cedar rapids iowa the strategy expanded to accommodate a compliance track for poultry use as well as part of the accelerated effort we contracted a number of wellregarded private and academic laboratories to establish a nutritional profile for the algal biomass as well conduct various safety and toxicology tests required for the gras selfaffirmation process the tests studies and validations will likely continue through most of  wellmetris we are working to make the wellmetris testing systems compliant with existing fda regulations and to that end have retained fda counsel and a medical device consulting firm which have advised us as to the most time and costefficient path to classification and approvals  this activity will continue upon availability of additional funding  research and development zivo research our algal culture has been subjected to product testing in its original form over several years beginning in  in spring of  we undertook a research and development process with a view to fractioning the existing product into much smaller concentrated groups of molecules with similar physical properties these groups were then tested in vivo and in vitro with successful results noted in maintaining healthy cholesterol levels  a patent application describing a novel method of cholesterol regulation was submitted to the us patent  trademark office in spring of  and a pct filing was submitted in february of  since january  we continue to develop our research programs internally and direct outside academic researchers private laboratories or contract research organizations to conduct experiments tests and studies on our behalf  we spent approximately  for the year ended december   on research and development as compared to  million in  the resources were spent on external research mainly to independent facilities involved in the analysis and validation of our bioactive compounds in various applications and animal models to date all of these amounts have been directly expensed as they have been incurred as of midmarch  the company has moved forward with the following rd activities · we are continuing work on a largescale bovine mastitis study utilizing samples validated in vitro by the principal researcher at the university of wisconsin  madison and samples processed and validated by other researchers in the fall of   the prepilot and pilot arms of this study have been completed and the results gained thus far may shorten the primary arm of this bovine study which is expected to commence upon available funding in early  · a study utilizing cadaver cartilage and joint tissue at the comparative orthopaedics laboratory located at the university of missouri showed positive early results for protective effects in canine joint health using our natural bioactive compounds the study will be repeated and expanded when capital funding is made available · a canine whole blood experiment was conducted at an international contract research organization to study the effects of our natural bioactive compounds on inflammatory cytokines and chemokines present in blood to assess whether a systemic or localized mechanism of action can be determined  although the results trended in a positive direction company principals determined that a more definitive in vivo study would be more useful pending capital funding · the ongoing elucidation and characterization of the natural bioactive compounds had undergone a data integrity review in early  further work to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the bioactives and developing a d model had been placed on hold since spring of  pending available funding in midmarch  the company reactivated the elucidation and characterization of the natural bioactive compounds as funding became available the center for complex carbohydrate research at the university of georgia was tasked with sample purification and preliminary analysis other laboratories were contracted to conduct bioassays to validate the bioactivity of the purified and isolated samples with work ongoing at the close of    the purposes for these various tests and experiments are manifold we are not only isolating bioactive molecules but also testing the method of isolation and then validating that the isolated molecules retain their bioactivity across a select range of human and animal cell lines and that these molecules exhibit no deleterious effects before they are introduced into humans or animals during in vivo studies we must ensure that this does not occur occasionally it is required for every production process every safety validation process and every intended application such as a canine dietary supplement that is mixed with food as opposed to a canine dietary supplement that is administered in the form of a chewable caplet further as we now enter production scaleup we are required to provide cgmp protocols and quality assurance qa protocols that show we can produce the algal biomass andor the active ingredients safely consistently and in defined quantities and therefore rely on these same experiments and methods to substantiate our quality claims these datasets form the basis for establishing the value of a license agreement therefore every single license that we hope to issue requires its own data set and safety validation for the specific application being licensed these datasets represent the core of the intellectual property that is being licensed  status of culturing and production independent of identifying the bioactive compounds or validating their bioactivity and safety is the process and method of growing and maintaining the algal culture that gives rise to the bioactive compounds in the first place this culture and its growing environment were developed decades ago  however the method was not commercially viable and the company has expended considerable resources to develop a singlespecies highvolume and commercially viable production methodology we made the decision to spread product development risk resulting in the creation of a product platform strategy whereby four different forms could be developed for future marketing across several categories and applications a the raw algae biomass which would naturally contain the beneficial compounds b a more refined extraction which could be introduced into animal feed or supplements c the isolated natural molecules which could be more appropriate for human consumption in food or supplements and d the synthetic version of any such natural molecules which could be licensed to drug development companies or jointventured in a risksharing arrangement to that end we contracted with several experts in the field to coordinate isolation of the different organisms present in the culture grow each of them separately and then subject them to the same lifecycle stressors as the original culture the stated goal was to grow algae in bulk as a direct source of micronutrition and feed ingredient for production animals namely beef cattle and dairy cows as well as companion animal dietary supplementation  the production capability would be licensed to others per the business model we have no intention of fielding a finished product but rather empowering licensees to strike supply agreements with larger betterfinanced brand names or licensing directly with such brand names there can be no assurance that commercially viable products will be developed or that they can be successfully and profitably manufactured and marketed over the course of  and  our contracted researchers have been able to successfully isolate one or more algal species scale up the productionoutput of the isolated species and still retain some of the key desirable bioactive properties associated with the earlier complex culture proof of concept growing techniques including both pond and bioreactor modes have shown that our target algal specie can be grown in commercially viable quantities and the harvest time has been compressed from several months to several days time we are uncertain if we can grow biomass in sufficient tonnage for livestock feed but we believe that the current production methods will allow us to satisfy demand for a more refined extract introduced into animal supplements and as a more purified substance into human supplements in  we tested the algal biomass and isolates derived from the aforementioned prototype growing facilities in dairy cows with successful results in  we finalized development of standard operating procedures sops in order to draft contractual terms with contract growers domestically and abroad the sops form the basis for current good manufacturing practice cgmp protocols to which contract growers and processors must adhere as part of the fdas updated food safety modernization act of  fsma requirements regardless of country of origin in early  we contracted with a floridabased algae grower to scaleup production in a commercial setting due to weather problems including hurricane matthew the grower was unable to successfully deliver the biomass required to remedy the situation we identified and began contract negotiations in late october with synthetic genomics inc sgi which operates an algae production facility in imperial valley california and concluded a tolling agreement in late december  sgi will also convert and upgrade the sops to cgmp level specifications so that we can meet compliance requirements we conducted experiments in postprocessing such as spraydrying centrifugal water extraction and other techniques to better understand feed and food handling requirements we interviewed fda compliance consultants for animal feed applications and contracted the burdock group of orlando florida in summer of  to manage the compliance process on our behalf looking forward a significant portion of our research efforts have been directed towards identifying a candidate class of compound and one or more active ingredients as it relates to autoimmune and antiinflammatory response these are very broad categories and work is still required to fully describe the d structure of such compounds as the actual structure is how the bioactivity exists and where the value is locked one approach among several weve taken is to create synthetic homologs and from them deduce the composition and d structure of the naturally bioactive compounds  in early  we determined that the synthetic approach was not yielding the hopedfor results and halted that particular effort in midmarch  we restarted the elucidation and characterization effort by contracting the center for complex carbohydrate research at the university of georgia to begin sample purification isolation and analyses supported by bioassay validation conducted at several private labs  subject to the availability of sufficient funding we estimate that we will in fiscal  be required to expend in excess of  on research and subsequent product development in order to complete the initiatives discussed herein in addition to the activity in  we plan to continue our research and development efforts in  and beyond  these expenditures will need to be met from external funding sources in the past we have had difficulty raising funds from external sources thus we may not be able to raise the funding required to continue our research and development activities in the event that these sources are not available or adequate to meet our research needs we will be unable to pursue our research activities in which case our ability to substantiate the accumulated intellectual property with objective clinical support for its characterization method of action and efficacy will continue to be impeded thereby severely hindering our ability to generate licensing revenue or otherwise commercialize our products and adversely affect our operating results in the event that we are successful in raising the necessary capital we will continue our current research program with our research partners we will expand our investigations to include various experts and consultants on an asneeded basis and explore new product concepts and applications our current contracts with our research partners cover the following activities · ongoing isolation and characterization of individual natural molecules from various production formats in sufficient quantities for downstream analyses experiments standards development fda compliance cgmp and qa protocols · ongoing validation of samples in vivo and in vitro to substantiate efficacy and safety for each specific application or claim ie poultry immune health canine osteoarthritis canine joint health porcine respiratoryreproductive syndrome etc to boost value for each specific license · synthetic developmentvalidation of individual molecules to boost value of licenses · ongoing validation of samples in vivo and in vitro for standards development fda safety compliance cgmp and qa protocols · product development initiatives such as the joint development project with nutriquest to develop a successful poultry feed ingredient a protein enhancement ingredient for fruit and vegan drinks and smoothies and a human dietary supplement formulation ancillary development activities would occur in parallel with our research partners development wellmetris wellmetris was initially focused on largescale programmatic applications of its testing and reporting platform we are interested in supporting the intervention by wellness consultants or medical professionals in the lifestyle choices made by individuals covered by traditional health insurance plans retiree medical benefits pools employersponsored health initiatives and taxpayersponsored programs like medicaid and the aca affordable care act or its replacement  these interventions which are typically nonmedical have been shown to be successful in delaying the onset of chronic diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular problems we believe that targeting asymptomatic individuals and focusing intervention efforts on these individuals may have a positive result for wellness programs and potentially lower premiums and health claims at the close of  the wellmetris product platform required additional prototype analyzers and additional dry chemistry reagent strips and cartridges to conduct pilot programs for potential customers and to use the result of these pilot programs to help normalize data for the dry chemistry reagents as part of the fda submission package such efforts are currently on hold pending capital funding in early  we refocused product development on selfmonitoring of individual health primarily focused on those individuals who purchase dietary supplements join health clubs or are otherwise actively pursuing a healthy lifestyle this involves miniaturizing some aspects of our test cartridge concept and creating a mobile application thereby eliminating the need for the analyzer device this is a significant undertaking which will not commence until we realize revenues from our phase  product launch or attract additional capital funding however incremental steps were taken in  to finalize d models of the sample collection device and the assay carrier in preparation for finite element testing of each component sometime in  pending available funding  compliance with environmental laws we believe that we are in all material respects in compliance with local state and federal environmental laws applicable to our production and waste disposal the cost of this compliance activity to date has not been material and has been absorbed within our general operations overhead employees as of december   we had two fulltime employees positioned in executive management in addition we have three parttime people acting on a consulting basis as our chief science officer director research  development and lead scientist  clinical coordinator we believe that our employee relations are good no employee is

at wwwsecgov item a  risk factors there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our consolidated financial statements which states that the consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and further states that our recurring losses from operations stockholders deficit and inability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations and sustain our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we are materially dependent on external sources for continued funding unless and until we realize licensing and royalty revenues sufficient to cover our expenses we will be reliant upon external sources to fund our continued operations there is no guarantee that this funding will continue if we are unable to raise additional funds there will be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we only have  million shares authorized for issuance as of december   we had  shares outstanding  we also had contractual commitments to issue  additional shares as of december   consisting of  common shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debentures and related accrued interest and  common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants  this totals a potential  shares outstanding if all debentures were converted and warrants exercised  in order to increase the authorized shares to a higher number we would need to amend our articles of incorporation which would require shareholder approval  there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the shareholder approval necessary to amend our articles of incorporation to increase our authorized shares our future success is dependent on our ability to establish strategic partnerships  we do not have resources to pursue the development manufacturing and marketing of products on our own and we will need to rely on third parties for some of these activities     there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully establish strategic partnerships the ability to market our product is dependent upon the completion of proven clinical research while we are currently undergoing studies to further identify the active ingredients in our products there is no guarantee that the research will successfully achieve this goal if our current research does not return the results we expect our business prospects will be materially and adversely affected government regulation of our products may adversely affect sales nutraceutical and animal supplement products although not subject to fda approval must follow strict guidelines in terms of production and advertising claims our ability to produce and successfully market our products is dependent upon adhering to these requirements  if we fail to comply with applicable government regulations concerning the production and marketing of our product we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties which would have a material adverse effect on our business we have a history of losses we expect to continue to incur losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future   we have incurred losses in each fiscal year of our existence we cannot assure you that we will reach profitability in the future or at any specific time in the future or that if and when we do become profitable we will sustain profitability if we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenue to meet our financial targets become profitable and have sustainable positive cash flows investors could lose their investment  competition from current competitors and new market entrants could adversely affect us   we compete with a wide range of established companies in a variety of different markets all of whom have substantially greater name recognition and resources than we do we face or will face other specialized competitors if we are able to expand into new vertical markets these competitors may be more efficient and successful than we are  if we fail to compete successfully our operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected changes in laws andor regulations may cause our business to suffer   the future success of our business depends upon our ability to meet regulatory requirements for the sale of our products increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations as well as any laws regulations or changes that may be adopted or implemented in the future could limit our ability to market our products the loss of key employees and technical personnel or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business   our success depends in part upon the continued service of our senior management personnel our success will also depend on our future ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical managerial and marketing personnel the market for qualified personnel has historically been and we expect that it will continue to be intensely competitive we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel the loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business we could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another partys intellectual property rights in recent years there has been significant litigation in the us and elsewhere involving patents and other intellectual property rights companies are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement misappropriation or other violations of patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets or other intellectual property rights these risks have been amplified by an increase in the number of third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims  we could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation additionally the defense or prosecution of claims could be timeconsuming and could divert our managements attention away from the execution of our business plan we cannot be certain that our products do not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  claims of alleged infringement or misappropriation could be asserted against us by third parties in the future  we cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claim moreover any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts or obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain a license from the third patty asserting the claim on commercially reasonable terms that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering and our customers to continue using our affected products or technology in addition we may be required to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us  an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our products or services to others infringement claims asserted with or without merit against us may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results  even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our technology in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party  moreover such infringement claims with or without merit may harm our relationships with our existing customers and may deter others from dealing with us we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and efforts to protect them may be costly and may substantially harm our business   our ability to compete effectively is dependent in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  while we hold one issued patent and pending patent applications covering certain elements of our technology these patents and more generally existing patent laws may not provide adequate protection for portions of the technology that are important to our business in addition our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents us patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws offer us only limited protection and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent accordingly defense of our trademarks and proprietary technology may become an increasingly important issue as we seek to expand our product development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection than the us policing unauthorized use of our trademarks and technology is difficult and the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of the trademarks or technology on which we rely if competitors are able to use our trademarks or technology without recourse our ability to compete would be harmed and our business would be materially and adversely affected  we may elect to initiate litigation in the future to enforce or protect our proprietary rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others that litigation may not be ultimately successful and could result in substantial costs to us the reduction or loss in intellectual property protection for our technology the diversion of our managements attention and harm to our reputation any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  if we do not pay cash dividends you could receive a return on your investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock has increased when you sell your shares substantial future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall   sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity securities we have outstanding warrants and convertible debt that may result in substantially more outstanding shares which could cause the price of our common stock to decline sales risk  wellmetris products we have not finished developing our products or sold any products  we have only begun test marketing  we cannot be assured that there is a sufficient market demand for our products  in addition while we are actively pursuing the relationships necessary to begin manufacturing and marketing the wellness tests we have not yet finalized agreements with potential business partners including thirdparty resellers labs or distributors of the wellness tests  failure to secure these critical alliances on reasonable terms could negatively impact us our business and future plans dependence on manufacturers we do not own or operate and currently do not plan to own or operate manufacturing facilities for production of tests or devices which are critical to the successful operation of the business we plan to target manufacturers and to form alliances for the mass production of our products but we have no assurance that such alliances will be established furthermore once we enter into such relationships we may not have sufficient longterm agreements with any thirdparty manufacturers to ensure adequate supply and price controls  this may result in delays quality control issues additional expenses and failure to meet demand or other customer obligations or needs failure of manufacturers to meet design specifications   the success of our products is contingent upon one or more third parties manufacturing products according to design specifications in practice this is difficult to enforce and guarantee as a result we may never realize the expected efficiency quality or sensitivity of our products and as a result may be required to continue research and development with another manufacturer  if a joint venture partner or contractor fails to meet design specifications we will experience delays in commencing operations or delays in fulfilling orders in the future such delays could have a material adverse

not required for smaller reporting companies  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for zivo we have put in place a business model in which we would derive future income from licensing and selling natural bioactive ingredients that may be derived from or are initially based on the algae cultures we expect that these planned new products will likely be sold to much larger betterfinanced animal food dietary supplement and medical food manufacturers  the anticipated income streams are to be generated from a royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients and b a toll on bulk sales of such ingredients these bulk ingredients will likely be made by contracted ingredient manufacturers and then sold by us to animal food dietary supplement and medical food processors andor namebrand marketers further we expect to license our bioactive molecules as lead compounds or templates for synthetic variants intended for therapeutic applications for wellmetris we are developing with the intention to manufacture market and sell tests that we believe will allow people to optimize their health and identify future health risks  we plan to develop and commercialize such tests in three phases · in phase one phase one or alternately named gen  we plan to develop and commercialize a series of tests which are intended to measure indicators of good health and optimal metabolic function collectively the phase one test  the phase one test is being designed to measure biomarkers related to oxidative stress inflammation and antioxidant status to establish a metabolic assessment from which intervention can commence and from which metabolic syndrome can be inferred · in phase two phase two or alternately named gen  we plan to develop and commercialize a testing technology focused on the positive or negative metabolic effects of metabolizing fat and muscle efficiency due to changes in diet exertion hydration and dietary supplements in a selfadministered format that integrates with smartphone operating systems · in phase three phase three or alternately named gen  we plan to develop and commercialize additional tests intended to provide a more complete metabolic profile for an individual utilizing the metabolites present in urine the company believes the gen  tests in aggregate will allow identification of healthy versus unhealthy bodily processes in realtime this technology can also be applied to livestock and companion animals as capital funding becomes available the company will move forward with product development we believe there is a viable market for our wellness tests  more than  of americans are afflicted with cardiovascular diseases diabetes autoimmune diseases and cancer   the wellness tests are intended to identify preconditions to such illnesses  such identification may allow for early intervention and reduce incidence of such illnesses or forestall their onset  this is critically important to large employers insurers and governmental agencies who are payers for health claims and are facing massive increases in premiums or cash outlays the wellmetris technology also incorporates sophisticated software to analyze report record and manage wellness and health data for large groups such as large employers pension funds accountable care organizations state medicaid agencies and their actuarial consultants underwriters reinsurers and wellness consultants the software also contains tools to conduct metaanalysis of baseline health benchmarks and monitor the progress of preclinical intervention programs within large groups since  we have been incurring significant operating losses and negative cash flow we experienced only nominal sales of our algal product which was pulled from the market in january of  and have relied primarily on the sale of company securities and shareholder loans to fund operations   we are also experiencing an ongoing and substantial working capital deficiency we have had difficulty raising capital from third parties in march of  we successfully raised capital to fund operations and research for the first half of  if we are unable to obtain additional funding in the near term we may be unable to continue as a going concern in which case you would likely suffer a total loss of your

requirement we have a near term need for additional funding historically we have had substantial difficulty raising funds from external sources however we recently were able to raise a limited amount

currently the companys focus is on research and identification of its bioactive ingredients and is not currently selling its product commercially and  developing manufacturing marketing and selling tests that the company believes will allow people to optimize their health and identify future health risks note   basis of presentation going concern the company had a net loss of  and  during the years ended december   and  respectively in addition the company had a working capital deficiency of  and a stockholders deficiency of  at december   these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern there can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources the lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would therefore have a material adverse effect on its business furthermore there can be no assurance that any such required funds if available will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the companys existing stockholders the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of assetcarrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern the company is attempting to address its lack of liquidity by raising additional funds either in the form of debt or equity or some combination thereof  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to raise the additional funds it requires during the year ended december   the company received proceeds of  from

its whollyowned subsidiaries health enhancement corporation hepi pharmaceuticals inc wellmetris llc and zivo biologic inc all significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation accounting estimates  the companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates  management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may as warranted solicit external professional advice and other assumptions believed to be reasonable    cash and cash equivalents  for the purpose of the statements of cash flows cash equivalents include time deposits certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less the company maintains cash and cash equivalents balances at financial institutions and are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation up to  at times balances in certain bank accounts may exceed the fdic insured limits cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased at december   the company did not have any cash equivalents f property and equipment  property and equipment consists of furniture and office equipment and are carried at cost less allowances for depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization is determined by using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets generally five to seven years  repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend the economic life of an existing fixed

clinical studies expenses were approximately  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively income taxes the company follows the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at december   and  were primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards since the company has a history of losses and it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a full valuation allowance has been established in addition utilization of net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization stock based compensation we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation  stock compensation   under the provisions of fasb asc  stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  the company generally issues grants to its employees consultants and board members  at the date of grant the company determines the fair value of the stock option award and recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period  the fair value of the stock option or warrant award is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model f during  and  warrants were granted to employees directors and consultants of the company  as a result of these grants the company recorded compensation expense of  and  during the years ended december   and  respectively the fair value of warrants was estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions   year ended december        expected volatility  to     to  expected dividends     expected term  years    to  years risk free rate  to     to  the blackscholes optionpricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable in addition optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility because the companys employee warrants have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate in managements opinion the existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee options income loss per share basic loss per share is computed by dividing the companys net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period presented diluted loss per share is based on the treasury stock method and includes the effect from potential issuance of common stock such as shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of
