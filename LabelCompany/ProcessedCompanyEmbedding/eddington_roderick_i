being appointed managing director in  continuing his association with the airline industry news limited subsidiary of news corporation appointed eddington chairman of ansett australia in january  four years before the airline failed news corp had taken control of the airline with tnt in  eddington was appointed deputy chairman of news limited in september  he was further promoted to the news corporation board in september  in a timely manoeuvre news corporation sold off ansett the airline eventually became insolvent in  partly as a result of the overall difficulties in the airline industry following the  terror attacks eddington managed to escape blame for the poor financial state of the airline apparently aided by his board membership of news corporation as others were loath to criticise him publicly the blame for the collapse has tended to be worn by the air new zealand management who bought the airline from news corporation in  without significant experience in managing large pointtopoint short and medium haul domestic networks prior to ansetts placement into administration by the air new zealand management eddington had successfully met most targets to turn ansetts misfortune around and some critics believe the airline was not technically insolvent after all british airways ceoedit eddington replaced former ba ceo bob ayling on  may  he removed many aspects of aylings corporate relaunch in early  the unpopular ethnicart tailfins were changed back to the traditional union jack tailfin he steered the company in the aftermath of the  september  attacks on new york city and washington dc which proved disastrous for many other airlines following a loss of £m in  eddingtons future size and shape costcutting programme allowed ba to report a profit of £m in  despite a decrease in turnover eddington declared these are good results in one of the toughest years in living memory and while this can be expected from a ceo trying to reassure investors it was against a climate of the iraq war and sars the decision to permanently retire the british airways concorde in  was made by eddington and his action remains highly controversial eddington stood down as chief executive officer of british airways on  september  after more than five years in the position he then returned to australia to take up a position as the head of the victorian major events association succeeding steve vizard eddington was replaced by willie walsh in october  after he had followed a sixmonth shadow position eddington received a knighthood in  for services to the aviation industry career as a company directoredit as of february  eddington was a nonexecutive board member of jpmorgan  nonexecutive chairman for australia and new zealand news corporation  nonexecutive director of publicly listed delaware united states based company john swire  sons pty ltd  nonexecutive director of australian proprietary subsidiary of hong kongbased privately held company john swire  sons hk ltd rio tinto group  nonexecutive director of both publicly listed companies in the group eddington also served on the board of allco finance group where he was one of three nonexecutive directors to approve allcos illfated acquisition of rubicon holdings a previouslyannounced plan for eddington to become chairman of anz banking group of australia and new zealand was first delayed from february  to february  then finally scuttled on  august  it is possible that his directorship of scandalplagued rio tinto group made such a position for him at anz untenable as corporate espionage by rio tinto against the chinese government is at issue government reportsedit transport study in britainedit main article eddington transport study on  december  eddington published a uk governmentsponsored report into the future of britains transport infrastructure the eddington transport study set out the case for action to improve road and rail networks as a crucial enabler of sustained productivity and competitiveness the reports main conclusions were that britain has transport networks that provide the right connections in the right places to support the journeys that matter to economic performance but roads in particular were in serious danger of becoming so congested the economy would suffer at the launch of the report eddington told journalists and transport industry representatives introducing road pricing to encourage drivers to drive less was an economic nobrainer there was he said no attractive alternative it would cut congestion by half by  and bring benefits to the british economy totalling £b the report also called for a programme of improvements to existing road and rail networks the expansion of key airports and adoption of the general principle that travellers should pay for the external costs of the pollution and congestion their journeys cause transport study in victoria australiaedit main article eddington transport
