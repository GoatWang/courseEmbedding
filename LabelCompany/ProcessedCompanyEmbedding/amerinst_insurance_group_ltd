medmarc offers recall coverage for thirdparty financial loss that results from the insured’s error or omission such as when the insured’s customer incurs expenses for undertaking a recall that arises as a result of the insured’s negligence in manufacturing or servicing of a product please talk to your medmarc underwriter if your client has a need for this coverage or would like to learn more  what

liability risk management services on a feeforservice basis  for more information please contact our risk management department at riskmanagementmedmarccom or at  is the fact that a product is approved by the fda sufficient enough information about the product to obtain a quote from medmarc fda approval of a product is important to the underwriting analysis as is the regulatory history of the company but it is not sufficient information for medmarc’s underwriters to provide a coverage quote in order to understand the company’s risk profile and coverage needs underwriters also will require information about the company’s size financial condition management team operations loss history and other information related to the company’s history and product lines what is medmarc’s capacity for medmarc’s products liability policy our capacity is  million per policy  for our manufacturers’ errors and omissions eo policy our capacity is  million   capacity is subject to underwriting and is not available for all applicants  what is medmarcs target risk medmarc provides coverage for the manufacturers and distributors of medical devices pharmaceuticals biotechnology in vitro diagnostics personal hygiene products and animal care products  we cover both original equipment manufacturers oems and contract manufacturers  we cover companies at every stage of their evolution—from clinical trialstage startups to multinational companies with extensive product lines what risk management services does medmarc provide through our risk management department medmarc helps medical technology and life sciences companies manage their products liability risks  we can identify your potential products liability exposures through our risk assessment process and then help you develop and implement strategies to mitigate your risk   we provide assistance with areas of your operations that tend to give rise to products liability such as supply chains product warnings and instructions for use and manufacturing procedures  there is a close association between regulatory compliance and products liability  for this reason we offer a variety of services designed to help companies comply with fda requirements  we also provide employee training that is designed to heighten awareness about products liability risk and the impact that it can have on your operations and bottom line will medmarc accept other carriers’ applications yes  medmarc is happy to accept applications from other carriers but please be aware that we may require additional information as a distributor do i need products liability coverage we recommend that distributors purchase their own products liability insurance policies  if a distributor is required to repackage or install a product or if the distributor provides training on the use of the product the distributor may have a potential exposure that is not typically covered under the manufacturer’s policy  furthermore independent acts of negligence on the part of the distributor typically would not be covered under the manufacturer’s policy or by contractual indemnification agreements a us distributor that imports products from a manufacturer located outside of the united states should be aware that the foreign manufacturer’s policy may not provide coverage in the us or may not provide coverage for the defense of claims in the us which could become very costly  medmarc’s risk management department has published an article that explains distributor risks the article is titled “why distributors may be more  vulnerable to products liability than they realize” and it is available on medmarc’s website in our resource library does your policy cover sales representatives “sales reps” the actions or omissions of sales reps when acting in the scope of their employment are covered under medmarc’s products liability insurance coverage such circumstances include when sales reps  provide product consultations  make device technical adjustments  are present in operating rooms during surgeries to answer questions deemed essential for patient care or  are present during patient monitoring visits to ensure compliance with clinical trial protocols by surgical staff and nurses for more information see the ask an expert by fran stockwell “do distributors require professional liability insurance coverage in addition to products liability insurance coverage”   does your policy cover explants of implantable devices our products liability policy covers explantations ie the surgical removal of implantable devices only when the product causes the patient harm what is the difference between a claimsmade policy and an occurrence policy insurance coverage can either be on a claims made or occurrence basis these terms refer to what the policy covers during the policy period a claimsmade policy provides insurance for claims made during a policy year or tail period regardless of when the loss occurred and an occurrence policy provides insurance for losses that occurred only during the policy year as specified on the declarations form a claims made policy provides coverage for claims made and reported during the policy term as long as they were made after the retroactive date the retroactive date is the start date of the first claimsmade policy obtained so long as it has been kept active via renewal that date remains the same and is not advanced as long as the policy is renewed for example if a client first obtains claimsmade coverage on october   and it is now  and theyve maintained the same coverage their claimsmade policy covers all incidents since october   if the client no longer has coverage in  and a patient sues in  for an incident that occurred in  the client does not have coverage for that incident unless they purchased tail coverage  an occurrence policy in contrast covers incidents that occur but are not necessarily reported during the term the policy is in force for example if a client obtained an occurrence policy covering  and a patient is injured by the clients product in  but does not sue for their injuries until  the client has coverage from their  policy even if they are no longer insured will medmarc provide coverage for nonmedical products because of our familiarity and longstanding connection with this industry we recognize that life sciences companies sometimes have product lines that include nonmedical products often we can accommodate this coverage need  your medmarc underwriter can answer any questions you might have about
