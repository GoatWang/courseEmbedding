rate peg of chf  per euro and later that month the european central bank announced that it was expanding its asset purchase program to include bonds issued by euroarea central governments agencies and european institutions the combined effect of these two events led the us dollar to substantially strengthen against the euro going from  at the end of  to  at the end of march this dynamic will create a meaningful currency headwind for us based multinationals with exposure to the eurozone and with currencies that have fallen against the dollar such as great britain russia and latin american

capturing the hearts of rust belt americans and consequently the white house  certainly qualifies as an unusual year the world depending on your perspective has been turned upside down or right side up everything from longstanding political beliefs to consumer preferences for food and entertainment has shifted in markets the long bull market in bonds is ending and value appears poised to beat growth for the first time since  through these tumultuous times you can rest assured that at least two things will not change our implementation of fundamental bottomup stock research combined with the timetested private market value with a catalysttm methodology and our commitment to superior client servicethe year in previewwhile  was marred by continued unrest in the middle east and terror incidents around the world the us presidential election dominated the national conscience to such an extent that it impacted football ratings and retail spending a conclusion to this quadrennial process some might say ordeal and greater political certainty would likely have sparked a market rally no matter who was elected but the  rise in the sp  since november  has the potential to rank as the largest market postelection move for a new president since the  inauguration of jfk the socalled “trump rally” has been fueled by the potential for increased fiscal stimulus lower corporate and individual taxes and deregulation taken together these elements could drive us gdp growth well above  deferring the inevitable end to the current ninety month old expansionbarron’s  roundtablemario j gabelli our chief investment officer has appeared in the prestigious barron’s roundtable discussion annually since  many of our readers enjoyed the inclusion of selected and edited comments from barron’s roundtable in previous reports to shareholders as is our custom we are including selected comments of mario gabelli trades portfolio from barron’s  roundtable part  and part  published on january  and january   respectivelymario gabelli trades portfolio head of gabelli funds and its parent firm is a wall street legend for good reason he’s a shrewd thematic investor with a love of deals an eye for steals and an encyclopedic knowledge of multiple businesses and the people who built themspeaking of opportunities how about sharing your ideas mariogabelli to echo my comments this morning in electing donald trump the us is moving away from creeping socialism toward the reinvigoration of capitalism we are seeing a wave of confidence in america which will spark a wave of innovation individual tax rates could fall from  to  a new tax plan could create only three tax tiers and the earned income credit could rise returning money to the working class also regulatory reform could help improve the tone of business the us consumer had a record net worth of  trillion as of september  minus debt thats  trillion there are two pockets of concern auto loans are up substantially in the past ten years and student loans have ballooned to  trillion thats a big dragthats the macro backdrop on stocks i recommended cbs last year and it rose nicely i expected cbs to buy viacom viab but it didnt happen viacom has  million shares outstanding about  million are class a controlled by the redstone familys nationalamusements the rest are class b with the b shares around  viacom has an equity valuation of  billion the enterprise value including debt is  billion viacoms paramount movie studio is a great brand but it lost about  million last year it must revitalize its theatrical and television production and it will viacom could also do some creative financing with paramount – selling assets entering joint ventures and suchviacoms cable tv networks arent performing well either how can the company turn those aroundgabelli the basic business includes nickelodeon mtv and other networks the new ceo bob bakish must trim the portfolio and energize product development we look for viacom to report  billion of revenue and  billion of ebitda in this fiscal year ending september  the stock trades for seven times enterprise value to ebitda if im apple aapl and want to get into the entertainment business and have a market cap of  billion viacom wouldnt be hard to buy but shari redstone president of national amusements likely wont sellblack dont you think viacom is a value trap it has been depressed for several yearsgabelli you are correct the assets werent managed right by the previous management team the companys ratings are starting to improve viacom stations in the aggregate have more viewers than espn notwithstanding millennials penchant for cordcutting cancellation of cable service the stock potentially could double in three years the rules are changing in the media business the industry will consolidate globallyschafer the problems are priced into the stockgabelli thank you a year ago congress passed the fast act – fixing americas surface transportation stocks like astec industries aste and gencor industries genc which make machinery used in highway construction surged if we get more visibility on infrastructure spending vendors to industrial companies will do well we like the rental equipment business the uber of the industry it is a  billion business in the us growing at  a yearwhich stock are you pickinggabelli herc holdings hri a rental equipment supplier was spun out of hertz global holdings htz on july   the company is a work in progress but should have a significant tail wind if the trump administration launches a big infrastructure initiative herc has an ebitda margin of  the stock is trading for  and the market cap is  billion herc has  billion of debt courtesy of hertz but it isnt overleveragedconstruction equipment companies also are well positioned my pick today is cnh industrial cnhi formerly case new holland the company has  million shares and the stock is trading for about  exor the agnelli familys holding company controls cnh since its merger with fiat industrial in  cnh has a large global presence in the construction equipment business it is also known for farming equipment and engines profits have been slim in the construction business but that could change cnh recently struck a deal with hyundai heavy industries korea stock exchange to make mini excavators through the fiat merger it owns iveco a european truck maker the class a truck market in europe is improving the stock could double in the next two yearsabout ten years ago i identified the singleserve coffee market as an exciting growth opportunityyou were hardly alonebillion business and sparkling water is the fastest growing subset it is growing by  a year lacroix gets significant floor space at grocers and has a  market share in its categorycohen what are the profit margins on thisgabelli let me give you the math first the fiscal year ends april  national beverage has been rolling up beverage companies it bought the shasta brand – which is popular in the west – and faygo and others energy drinks are a small part of the business lacroix should generate  million in revenue this fiscal year and  million of ebitda so the profit margin isnt as high as you would expect the ceo is taxsensitive the company declared a dividend of  a share in late november but it isnt payable until jan  after trump becomes president if congress abolishes the estate tax and the tax on long term capital gains comes down would he be likely to sell the company i doubt it but eventually cocacola ko or pepsico pep or dr pepper snapple group dps will knock on the doorrogers is lacroix nationally distributedgabelli yes more or less national beverage has significant bottling capacity lacroix is their premier brandlacroixs revenue could rise to  million over the next several years driving overall revenue to more than  billion shasta is doing okay and the other brands are small national beverage is likely to earn  a share this year rising to  in the year ending april  capital expenditure is de minimis maybe  million the company doesnt put money into trucks or delivery routespriest what is the market capgabelli today i like the prospects for sparkling water — in particular national beverage fizz which markets lacroix the company is based in florida and has  million shares outstanding the stock sells for  the ceo nick caporella is sugary soft drinks are perceived to be bad for you and in some places theyre being taxed but lacroix has no sugar or additives carbonated soft drinks are a  gabelli it is about  billion we look for new products and new channels of distribution the one i kick myself for is amazoncom amzn if only wed known jeffrey bezos amazons founder back when he worked on wall streetmoving on to the booze market known as spirits in the trade we own davide camparimilano cpritalian stock exchange it is selling for € and has  million shares outstanding the garavoglia family owns  of the company but it is professionally managed management uses cash flow smartly campari will have about € billion of revenue in the current year the company owns a number of brands including campari wild turkey bourbon aperol and skyy vodka it recently bought grand marnier campari acquires niche brands globally they are huge cash generators with high gross profit marginsgive us the numbers pleasegabelli in  ebitda including grand marnier could total € million the us accounts for  of revenue italy is also next millennials want experiences they dont want goods they are a sharing society they go to concerts and other forms of live entertainment they go to burning man and coachella think about las vegas which is undergoing a new life cycle about  years ago it attracted gamblers then it went into the family entertainment business now las vegas is a big standard  poors  warren buffett trades portfolio and malone are the two most taxsensitive ceos i have ever encountered their philosophy is pay less pay later or pay nothing buffett doesnt advertise it but malone is upfront about it malone has about  billion of his own money tied up in libertyrelated companieslast april liberty created a tracking stock called liberty braves group batrk which represents an investment in the atlanta braves now you can buy a baseball team at a discount liberty braves also has a real estate business that owns

friday jan  at  the company has about  billion in net debt it is a concert promoter and ticket seller it owns ticketmaster the company could have about  million of ebitda in is that all mariogabelli mueller water products mwa has  million shares outstanding and trades for  it has no debtwitmer do you like the management teamgabelli thats why im recommending it they just hired a new ceo from textron txt hes taking over a company with  million of revenue  million comes from fire hydrants and  million from valves ebitda is about  million and capex is  million to  million those are the kinds of things i like today the company announced the sale of its anvil international piping system divisionthere are so many attractive companies when you think about how a  tax rate would boost earnings we expect more corporate takeovers too romance is in the airlets leave things therethanks mario corporate tax reform has been on the washington agenda for many years but with the executive and legislative branches in the hands of one party it could finally become a reality with many details to be reconciled a reduction in corporate tax rates from  to  or even lower combined with a change to the current global system that taxes profits wherever they are earned should lead to higher earnings similarly a reduction in individual tax brackets and rates has the potential to stoke consumption and increase the incentive for work both of these reforms will have to be accompanied by offsetting limits to deductions including the potential elimination of the deductibility of corporate interest expense which could have broad consequences and somewhat limit the impact of lower rates increased fiscal stimulus in the form of increased infrastructure and defense spending should also boost gdp growth but may be limited by republican concerns about the size of the deficit and the practical scarcity of shovelready projects finally a rollback in the regulatory creep of the obama years seems most assured a redesign of the healthcare system a loosening of doddfrank rules governing the banking system a lighter touch toward internet regulation a different approach to domestic energy production and transportation and a more accommodative vision for antitrust enforcement appear to have awakened the animal spirits of the business communitytrump as presidenttrump will make mistakes as all presidents do for better or worse our federal constitutional system with the checks and balances of congress and the courts and power dispersed through the states modulates change by design as we witness the evolution of candidate trump into presidentelect trump he has gathered some controversial but wellseasoned advisors and seems humbled by the majesty of the office three areas bear continued watching protectionism is bad for consumers and businesses alike but “free” trade is not always “fair” trade and doesn’t mean that the president shouldn’t attempt to negotiate better deals with our trading partners second a geopolitical crisis is a near certainty over the next four years – how will trump balance a desire to project a strong america with a distaste for foreign entanglements lastly it is worth noting that candidates who are populists are usually not unwaveringly probusiness ceos in all sectors should be alert for twitter bombs the modern form of jawboning such as those lobbed by the incoming president at the pharmaceutical industry and several defense contractorstailwinds and headwindspresident trump will inherit several interrelated macroeconomic shifts that were already in motion before the election and accentuated by its aftermath higher interest rates a stronger dollar and increased inflation expectations the tenyear us treasury note rose from a low of  in july to  at the time of this writing while the dollar has strengthened against its trade weighted basket by about  over the same time frame the federal reserve has signaled a willingness to raise rates multiple times in  a divergence in monetary policy from still dovish central banks in europe and japan not to mention a fraying of the european union will continue to propel the dollar and reduce the competitiveness of us exports an outcome neither chairman janet yellen nor the new administration will relish a tightening labor market and the promised fiscal stimulus may however force the hand of the fed with all else equal higher interest rates and accelerating inflation are bad for all asset classes including equities but all else is never equal the question is whether gdp and consequently earnings growth will accelerate enough to overcome the natural governors of higher rates felt in the form of higher borrowing costs and inflation felt in the form of reduced purchasing power put simply earnings estimates for sp  may be revised upward but may not overcome the pressure of a reduction in the market multiple which at over x is already above historical norms much as it is foolish to underestimate the dynamic nature of the economy one cannot generalize changes in the political economic environment to all industries this has spurred a “great rotation” in the equity market markets especially since the election from growth to value noncyclical to cyclical and large cap to small cap stocks to the extent that financial companies are overrepresented in value indices all of these shifts can be understood as the pendulum swinging to those companies most levered to tax reform and domestic stimulus and least exposed to currency and trade disruptions indeed the fang stocks facebook amazon netflix googlealphabet  of net assets as of december   that dominated returns in  trail the market slightly this year up a weighted average  and appear out of favor both in washington and on wall street what remains to be seen is whether the virtuous vicious if you are a value investor cycle of flows into passive etfs and these names has been brokenyour portfolio deals deals  more dealswe believe we are generally well positioned for almost any economic environment including the inflationary one described above our holdings tend to be domestically focused with strong franchises and often pricing power we have never been topdown allocators trying to chase every trend rather we rely on fundamental bottomup research informed by our view of the shifting political economic tides we purchase and hold securities trading at discounts to their private market values appropriate for their level of risk and seek to identify one or more catalysts that could close that valuation gap industry consolidation financial engineering eg spinoffs changes in management and changes in regulation are just a few catalysts in which the portfolio is rich in briefspinoff activity was healthy in  though down from  and  notable spinoffs in the portfolio include the separation of hertz’s equipment rental unit herc from the car rental business the spinoff of honeywell’s  of net assets as of december   nylon business advansix the spinoff of johnson controls’  automotive interiors business adient and the continued transformation of conagra under ceo sean connolly with its spinoff of potato processor lamb westonas could be expected dr john malone contributed to our list of new securities with the spinoff of liberty expedia  from liberty ventures and the issuance of three new tracker stocks liberty siriusxm  representing a  stake in siriusxm radio liberty brave  representing ownership of the atlanta braves baseball club and related real estate and liberty media  accounting for a variety of public and private assets including a  stake in live nation entertainment it is worth noting that prior spins provide fertile ground for deals as illustrated by the involvement of a spinoff parent or child in so many transactions belowwe were the beneficiaries of another strong year of mergers and acquisitions ma as well two deals announced in  involving significant holdings – the longawaited purchase of cablevision and carl icahn trades portfolio’s purchase of pep boys – closed during  january began with johnson controls agreeing to acquire tyco international in a  billion stock deal this was followed in february by apollo’s agreement to acquire adt the home security spinoff of tyco for  in cash both transactions have closed other announced deals include couchetard’s  cash offer for cst brands  the convenience store spinoff of valero and german chemical manufacturer lanxess ag’s  cash offer for chemtura  the biggest merger of the year belongs to att which after acquiring satellite distributor directv from us in  set its sights on leading content producer and serial financial engineer time warner  att has agreed to pay  in cash and stock in a transaction that will garner scrutiny in washington but we think is likely to succeed finally at the time of this writing there is speculation that g capital and berkshire hathawaywarren buffett trades portfolio have identified their next meal in the global food space – mondelez  which was formerly part of g’s current acquisition vehicle kraftheinzin our view more accommodative regulatory agencies a potential windfall of repatriated offshore cash and historically low but prospectively higher interest rates should continue to drive ma and benefit our style of investinginvestment scorecardthe largest contributor to performance in  was cbs corp  of net assets as of december    which despite suspending a potential tieup with viacom  continued to perform very well as a standalone content company under leslie moonves as discussed above time warner  agreed to be acquired by att for  in cash and stock and was a strong contributor to performance companies exposed to infrastructure investment such as xylem   aerospace and defense spending such as crane co   and honeywell  and improving energy fundamentals such as circor   and national fuel gas   performed well finally despite a pullback late in the fourth quarter gold miner newmont mining   was up sharply for the yeardetractors from performance included us media companies viacom  and amc

strive for continuous improvement as always we thank you for your trust and we look forward to what the future brings postscriptin closing we thought you would enjoy alexis de tocqueville’s description of presidential elections from his classic democracy in america  as you reflect on the year that has been and the vibrancy of our american experimentfor a long while before the appointed time has come the election becomes important and so to speak the allengrossing topic of discussion factional ardor is redoubled and all the artificial passions which the imagination can create in a happy and peaceful land are agitated and brought to light…as the election draws near the activity of intrigue and the agitation of the populace increase the citizens are divided into hostile camps each of which assumes the name of its favorite candidate the whole nation glows with feverish excitement the election is the daily theme of the press the subject of private conversation the end of every thought and every action the sole interest of the present it is true that as soon as the choice is determined this ardor is dispelled calm returns and the river which had nearly broken its banks sinks to its usual level but who can refrain from astonishment that such a storm should have arisenin de tocqueville’s native tongue plusçachangeplusc’estlamêmechosejanuary   note the views expressed

to rank as the largest market postelection move for a new president since the  inauguration of jfk the socalled trump rally has been fueled by the potential for increased fiscal stimulus lower

comments from barrons roundtable in previous reports to shareholders as is our custom we are including selected comments of mario gabelli trades portfolio from barrons  roundtable part  and part  published on january  and january   respectivelymario gabelli trades portfolio head of gabelli funds and its parent firm is a wall street legend for good reason hes a shrewd thematic investor with a love of deals an eye for steals and an encyclopedic knowledge of multiple businesses and the people who built themspeaking of opportunities how about sharing your ideas mariogabelli to echo my comments this morning in electing donald trump the us is moving away from creeping socialism toward the reinvigoration of capitalism we are seeing a wave of confidence in america which will spark a wave of innovation individual tax rates could fall from  to  a new tax plan could create only three tax tiers and the earned income credit could rise returning money to the working class also regulatory reform could help improve the tone of business the us consumer had a record net worth of  trillion as of september  minus debt thats  trillion there are two pockets of concern auto loans are up substantially in the past ten years and student loans have ballooned to  trillion thats a big dragthats the macro backdrop on stocks i recommended cbs last year and it rose nicely i expected cbs to buy viacom viab but it didnt happen viacom has  million shares outstanding about  million are class a controlled by the redstone familys nationalamusements the rest are class b with the b shares around  viacom has an equity valuation of  billion the enterprise value including debt is  billion viacoms paramount movie studio is a great brand but it lost about  million last year it must revitalize its theatrical and television production and it will viacom could also do some creative financing with paramount  selling assets entering joint ventures and suchviacoms cable tv networks arent performing well either how can the company turn those aroundgabelli the basic business includes nickelodeon mtv and other networks the new ceo bob bakish must trim the portfolio and energize product development we look for viacom to report  billion of revenue and  billion of ebitda in this fiscal year ending september  the stock trades for seven times enterprise value to ebitda if im apple aapl and want to get into the entertainment business and have a market cap of  billion viacom wouldnt be hard to buy but shari redstone president of national amusements likely wont sellblack dont you think viacom is a value trap it has been depressed for several yearsgabelli you are correct the assets werent managed right by the previous management team the companys ratings are starting to improve viacom stations in the aggregate have more viewers than espn notwithstanding millennials penchant for cordcutting cancellation of cable service the stock potentially could double in three years the rules are changing in the media business the industry will consolidate globallyschafer the problems are priced into the stockgabelli thank you a year ago congress passed the fast act  fixing americas surface transportation stocks like astec industries aste and gencor industries genc which make machinery used in highway construction surged if we get more visibility on infrastructure spending vendors to industrial companies will do well we like the rental equipment business the uber of the industry it is a  billion business in the us growing at  a yearwhich stock are you pickinggabelli herc holdings hri a rental equipment supplier was spun out of hertz global holdings htz on july   the company is a work in progress but should have a significant tail wind if the trump administration launches a big infrastructure initiative herc has an ebitda margin of  the stock is trading for  and the market cap is  billion herc has  billion of debt courtesy of hertz but it isnt overleveragedconstruction equipment companies also are well positioned my pick today is cnh industrial cnhi formerly case new holland the company has  million shares and the stock is trading for about  exor the agnelli familys holding company controls cnh since its merger with fiat industrial in  cnh has a large global presence in the construction equipment business it is also known for farming equipment and engines profits have been slim in the construction business but that could change cnh recently struck a deal with hyundai heavy industries korea stock exchange to make mini excavators through the fiat merger it owns iveco a european truck maker the class a truck market in europe is improving the stock could double in the next two yearsabout ten years ago i identified the singleserve coffee market as an exciting growth opportunityyou were hardly alonebillion business and sparkling water is the fastest growing subset it is growing by  a year lacroix gets significant floor space at grocers and has a  market share in its categorycohen what are the profit margins on thisgabelli let me give you the math first the fiscal year ends april  national beverage has been rolling up beverage companies it bought the shasta brand  which is popular in the west  and faygo and others energy drinks are a small part of the business lacroix should generate  million in revenue this fiscal year and  million of ebitda so the profit margin isnt as high as you would expect the ceo is taxsensitive the company declared a dividend of  a share in late november but it isnt payable until jan  after trump becomes president if congress abolishes the estate tax and the tax on long term capital gains comes down would he be likely to sell the company i doubt it but eventually cocacola ko or pepsico pep or dr pepper snapple group dps will knock on the doorrogers is lacroix nationally distributedgabelli yes more or less national beverage has significant bottling capacity lacroix is their premier brandlacroixs revenue could rise to  million over the next several years driving overall revenue to more than  billion shasta is doing okay and the other brands are small national beverage is likely to earn  a share this year rising to  in the year ending april  capital expenditure is de minimis maybe  million the company doesnt put money into trucks or delivery routespriest what is the market capgabelli today i like the prospects for sparkling water  in particular national beverage fizz which markets lacroix the company is based in florida and has  million shares outstanding the stock sells for  the ceo nick caporella is sugary soft drinks are perceived to be bad for you and in some places theyre being taxed but lacroix has no sugar or additives carbonated soft drinks are a  gabelli it is about  billion we look for new products and new channels of distribution the one i kick myself for is amazoncom amzn if only wed known jeffrey bezos amazons

company owns a number of brands including campari wild turkey bourbon aperol and skyy vodka it recently bought grand marnier campari acquires niche brands globally they are huge cash generators with high gross profit marginsgive us the numbers pleasegabelli in  ebitda including grand marnier could total eur million the us accounts for  of revenue italy is also next millennials want experiences they dont want goods they are a sharing society they go to concerts and other forms of live entertainment they go to burning man and coachella think about las vegas which is undergoing a new life cycle about  years ago it attracted gamblers then it went into the family entertainment business now las vegas is a big standard  poors  warren buffett trades portfolio and malone are the two most

is about  million and capex is  million to  million those are the kinds of things i like today the company announced the sale of its anvil international piping system divisionthere are so many attractive companies when you think about how a  tax rate would boost earnings we expect more corporate takeovers too romance is in the airlets leave things therethanks mario corporate tax reform has been on the washington agenda for many years but with the executive and legislative branches in the hands of one party it could finally become a reality with many details to be reconciled a reduction in corporate tax rates from  to  or even lower combined with a change to the current global system that taxes profits wherever they are earned should lead to higher earnings similarly a reduction in individual tax brackets and rates has the potential to stoke consumption and increase the incentive for work both of these reforms will have to be accompanied by offsetting limits to deductions including the potential elimination of the deductibility of corporate interest expense which could have broad consequences and somewhat limit the impact of lower rates increased fiscal stimulus in the form of increased infrastructure and defense spending should also boost gdp growth but may be limited by republican concerns about the size of the deficit and the practical scarcity of shovelready projects finally a rollback in the regulatory creep of the obama years seems most assured a redesign of the healthcare system a loosening of doddfrank rules governing the banking system a lighter touch toward internet regulation a different approach to domestic energy production and transportation and a more accommodative vision for antitrust enforcement appear to have awakened the animal spirits of the business communitytrump as presidenttrump will make mistakes as all presidents do for better or worse our federal constitutional system with the checks and balances of congress and the courts and power dispersed through the states modulates change by design as we witness the evolution of candidate trump into presidentelect trump he has gathered some controversial but wellseasoned advisors and seems humbled by the majesty of the office three areas bear continued watching protectionism is bad for consumers and businesses alike but free trade is not always fair trade and doesnt mean that the president shouldnt attempt to negotiate better deals with our trading partners second a geopolitical crisis is a near certainty over the next four years  how will trump balance a desire to project a strong america with a distaste for foreign entanglements lastly it is worth noting that candidates who are populists are usually not unwaveringly probusiness ceos in all sectors should be alert for twitter bombs the modern form of jawboning such as those lobbed by the incoming president at the pharmaceutical industry and several defense contractorstailwinds and headwindspresident trump will inherit several interrelated macroeconomic shifts that were already in motion before the election and accentuated by its aftermath higher interest rates a stronger dollar and increased inflation expectations the tenyear us treasury note rose from a low of  in july to  at the time of this writing while the dollar has strengthened against its trade weighted basket by about  over the same time frame the federal reserve has signaled a willingness to raise rates multiple times in  a divergence in monetary policy from still dovish central banks in europe and japan not to mention a fraying of the european union will continue to propel the dollar and reduce the competitiveness of us exports an outcome neither chairman janet yellen nor the new administration will relish a tightening labor market and the promised fiscal stimulus may however force the hand of the fed with all else equal higher interest rates and accelerating inflation are bad for all asset classes including equities but all else is never equal the question is whether gdp and consequently earnings growth will accelerate enough to overcome the natural governors of higher rates felt in the form of higher borrowing costs and inflation felt in the form of reduced purchasing power put simply earnings estimates for sp  may be revised upward but may not overcome the pressure of a reduction in the market multiple which at over x is already above historical norms much as it is foolish to underestimate the dynamic nature of the economy one cannot generalize changes in the political economic environment to all industries this has spurred a great rotation in the equity market markets especially since the election from growth to value noncyclical to cyclical and large cap to small cap stocks to the extent that financial companies are overrepresented in value indices all of these shifts can be understood as the pendulum swinging to those companies most levered to tax reform and domestic stimulus and least exposed to currency and trade disruptions indeed the fang stocks facebook amazon netflix googlealphabet  of net assets as of december   that dominated returns in  trail the market slightly this year up a weighted average  and appear out of favor both in washington and on wall street what remains to be seen is whether the virtuous vicious if you are a value investor cycle of flows into passive etfs and these names has been brokenyour portfolio deals deals  more dealswe believe we are generally well positioned for almost any economic environment including the inflationary one described above our holdings tend to be domestically focused with strong franchises and often pricing power we have never been topdown allocators trying to chase every trend rather we rely on fundamental bottomup research informed by our view of the shifting political economic tides we purchase and hold securities trading at discounts to their private market values appropriate for their level of risk and seek to identify one or more catalysts that could close that valuation gap industry consolidation financial engineering eg spinoffs changes in management and changes in regulation are just a few catalysts in which the portfolio is rich in briefspinoff activity was healthy in  though down from  and  notable spinoffs in the portfolio include the separation of hertzs equipment rental unit herc from the car rental business the spinoff of honeywells  of net assets as of december   nylon business advansix the spinoff of johnson controls  automotive interiors business adient and the continued transformation of conagra under ceo sean connolly with its spinoff of potato processor lamb westonas could be expected dr john malone contributed to our list of new securities with the spinoff of

braves baseball club and related real estate and liberty media  accounting for a variety of public and private assets including a  stake in live nation entertainment it is worth noting that prior spins provide fertile ground for deals as illustrated by the involvement of a spinoff parent or child in so many transactions belowwe were the beneficiaries of another strong year of mergers and acquisitions ma as well two deals announced in  involving significant holdings  the longawaited purchase of cablevision and carl icahn trades portfolios purchase of pep boys  closed during  january

offer for chemtura  the biggest merger of the year belongs to att which after acquiring satellite distributor directv from us in  set its sights on leading content producer and serial financial engineer time warner  att has agreed to pay  in cash and stock in a transaction that will garner scrutiny in washington but we think is likely to succeed finally at the time of this writing there is speculation that g capital and berkshire hathawaywarren buffett trades portfolio have identified their next meal in the global food space  mondelez  which was formerly part of gs current acquisition

local television stations and  radio stations we believe that cbs has a number of opportunities to generate incremental nonadvertising revenue from the sale of existing content through its ott platforms online video distributors and retransmission agreements with traditional distributors in addition we expect a continued recovery in advertising to contribute to earnings growth finally we believe that financial engineering including the splitoff of its radio business could act as a catalyst for shares honeywell international inchonnyse hon operates as a diversified technology company with highly engineered products including turbine propulsion engines auxiliary power units turbochargers brake pads environmental and combustion controls sensors security and life safety products resins and chemicals nuclear services and process technology for the petrochemical and refining industries one of the key drivers of hons growth is acquisitions that increase the companys growth profile globally creating both organic and inorganic opportunities the company recently acquired elster industries a leading provider of thermal gas solutions smart meters software and data analytics for the commercial industrial and residential heating market elsters gas business offers products in high demand among natural gas customers and brings a strong global distribution network and numerous crossselling opportunities for existing hon technologies to new customers elsters gas electric and water meters are highly valued for their reliability safety and accuracy the company maintains an installed base of more than  million meter modules deployed over the course of the last  years that generate significant recurring revenues we believe acquisitions such as elster should
