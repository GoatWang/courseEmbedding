the post more recursive loops  a blog on blogging i found that i enjoyed writing on my own schedule and continued the practice during the last few years as ceo of thomson reuters   now that i have stepped down as chief executive of thomson reuters there should be less confusion as to the purpose of these writings for my part i shall feel less constrained than while associated with the company to comment on items which reuters journalists may be writing about or which might not live up to the requirements of independence and freedom from political affiliation imposed by the thomson reuters trust principles   im going to continue to write about what interests me such as the transition from analog to digital across various media as well as wider issues in technology economics and politics i will also continue to write about the small delights and ironies in every day life such as marriage to an independentlyminded finn for over a quarter century and the joys of bringing up our two kids
