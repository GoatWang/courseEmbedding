water separation frac water stormwater refinery wastewater cleanup and biofuels the separation market encompasses many series of multibillion dollar segments spread globally across many industries and applications evtns voraxial® separation systems have completed projects with many of the worlds top industrial companies including conocophillips cameco repsol us navy and transocean evtn was originally founded as a high precision aerospace manufacturer that built the gyro platforms for the hubble space telescope as well as missile and satellite components  evtn reinvested its profits along with equity investors that include two european intuitions toward the development of the voraxial® separator the voraxial® is now successfully commercialized and is the exclusive focus of evtns business evtn owns significant intellectual property surrounding the voraxial® and has new innovations under development to enhance its potentially market dominant technology more about evtn enviro voraxial technology inc has its roots deep in the precision aerospace and defense industry in the s alberto di bella above served as the founder and president of florida precision aerospace a florida corporation based out of deerfield beach in its prime florida precision aerospace employed a very large staff and was responsible for precision machining for numerous industries including defense contracting aerospace automotive and healthcare in the early s as the defense budget scaled back mr di bella downsized the company and focused on smaller high gross margin jobs in the aerospace industry projects include the gyroscope housing for the hubble space telescope gear shift systems and beryllium manufacturing in the ’s mr di bella assisted in the designing and prototype development of the patented voraxial® separator in  florida precision aerospace acquired idaho silver a public company and changed its name to enviro voraxial technology inc the company continues to operate as enviro voraxial technology and its subsidiary florida precision aerospace for reason of defense qualification procedures from a  interview with ceo john di bella our technology fills a void in one of the largest market sectors in the world which is the ability to separate contaminants from a large volume of liquids with less space energy and weight this increases productivity and significantly reduces costs for our customers  our customers include some of the largest companies in the world… if you extrapolate this out twelve to twentyfour months from now there is no reason why we are not

vs hydrocyclone centrifuge the voraxial® separator is superior to hydrocyclones and centrifuges and outperforms both in key oilwater separator applications a hydrocyclones inherent limitation is its requirement for a pressure drop to conduct separation there is no pressure drop with the voraxial® further a hydrocyclone cannot perform way separation in order to accomplish this with hydrocyclone or centrifugetype units two separate units are required  one hydrocyclone for solids removal and another for oil removal a single voraxial® with its patented vortex separation however can easily and efficiently achieve way separation in one single pass   multiple industry uses oil water separator for oil  gas exploration and production short video grit separation municipal wastewater treatment

applications  the dark line is the concentrated fluid stream of oil  surrounding the oil stream is the clear concentrated fluid stream of water if solids were present in the fluid stream they would be spun to the outermost exterior of the fluid stream               voraxial® wastewater treatment separator oilwater separator – oilwatersand separation multiple uses efficient high volume separatortechnology for liquidliquid solidliquid solidliquidliquid or gas the voraxial® separators wastewater treatment process with vortex separation is proven to be a return on investment on average in  months no pressure drop the voraxial® is a unique patented inline separator that provides a cost effective method to efficiently separate large volumes of solids liquids and gases of different specific gravities and without the need of a pressure drop small foot print the voraxial® provides highly efficient separation in wastewater treatment of all types while requiring less space energy and weight than conventional separators processing the same volume ease of use the voraxial® can efficiently handle fluctuations in flow rate and oil concentrations without any adjustments allowing for ease of installation and operation in use at wastewater treatment plants oil rigs or food processing facilities there is only one moving part on the voraxial® allowing for very little costly downtime in the event of maintenance or repair high volumeenergy efficient superior separation is achieved in realtime and in much greater volumes with a more compact and energy efficient machine than any product on the market today high volume separator scalable voraxial® models  separator –  gpm  separator –  gpm  separator –  gpm  separator –  gpm separates  components simultaneously oilwater
