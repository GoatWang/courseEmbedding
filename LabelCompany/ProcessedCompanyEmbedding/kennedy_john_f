narrow margin in the popular vote kennedy became the first roman catholic president his inaugural address offered the memorable injunction ask not what your country can do for youask what you can do for your country as president he set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get america moving again his economic programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion since world war ii before his death he laid plans for a massive assault on persisting pockets of privation and poverty responding to ever more urgent demands he took vigorous action in the cause of equal rights calling for new civil rights legislation his vision of america extended to the quality of the national culture and the central role of the arts in a vital society he wished america to resume its old mission as the first nation dedicated to the revolution of human rights with the alliance for progress and the peace corps he brought american idealism to the aid of developing nations but the hard reality of the communist challenge remained shortly after his inauguration kennedy permitted a band of cuban exiles already armed and trained to invade their homeland the attempt to overthrow the regime of fidel castro was a failure soon thereafter the soviet union renewed its campaign against west berlin kennedy replied by reinforcing the berlin garrison and increasing the nations military strength including new efforts in outer space confronted by this reaction moscow after the erection of the berlin wall relaxed its pressure in central europe instead the russians now sought to install nuclear missiles in cuba when this was discovered by air reconnaissance in october  kennedy imposed a quarantine on all offensive weapons bound for cuba while the world trembled on the brink of nuclear war the russians backed down and agreed to take the missiles away the american response to the cuban crisis evidently persuaded moscow of the futility of nuclear blackmail kennedy now contended that both sides had a vital interest in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and slowing the arms racea contention which led to the test ban treaty of  the months after the cuban crisis showed significant progress toward his goal of a world of law and free choice banishing the world of war and coercion his administration thus saw the beginning of new hope for both the equal rights of americans and the

pobjoy mint has been a leader in innovative coin design and craftsmanship for more than  years derek pobjoy started the private mint in  coming from a background in jewelry the first coins minted were commemorative sterling silver and gold coins in memory of former prime minister sir winston churchill which launched the mint into becoming a huge success the idea that countries big or small can and should have their own coinage is what pushed the pobjoy mint forward pobjoy approached the isle of man government to begin a program of collector coins with corresponding values and specifications as british coins in  the pobjoy mint created the first practical set of coins for the isle of man including a  penny and up to  pence coins these coins included historical and cultural elements such as the isle of man’s distinctive threelegged “triskele” insignia since then the pobjoy mint has issued an array of innovative and artistic coins sought after by some of the choosiest collectors one particular contribution to numismatics and coin production was the development of the world’s first satisfactory manmade precious metal called virenium which has been used in high denomination coinage since  this was hailed worldwide as the first significant breakthrough in coinage from the last century the pobjoy mint provides circulation and collector coinage for  countries and territories and that number is ever increasing pobjoy mint has been consistently recognized within the numismatic industry for their innovations including  “firsts” such as the first silver one kilo coin the first coin in the shape of the eiffel tower the first titanium coin and the world’s highest relief coin the pobjoy mint has demonstrated their ability to push the limits of the coin industry to surprising

the same way about jack and was utterly devastated by jacks death in  friends and family said that after his brothers death bobby was never the same man despite their later close bond he and brother robert f kennedy were not close growing up this was due in part to the eightyear age difference between them it was not until jack during his third term as a massachusetts congressman took a sevenweek trip through the far east and parts of the middle east and took bobby who had just graduated from law school with him that they grew closer during the trip the duo discovered their mutual similarities and forged the deep bond that would last until jacks death jack appointed bobby his campaign manager in  and in  he was reportedly so close to bobby that while he was president he would often ask wheres bobby during important meetings and would finally relax when bobby showed up for his part bobbys devout loyalty to jack was often ridiculed and parodied by the media bobby loving to poke fun at

over two thousand books has been written about the events surrounding his assassination personally ordered the bay of pigs invasion on  april  the failure of the bay of pigs invasion the construction of the berlin wall and a negotiated settlement between the prowestern government of laos and the pathet lao communist movement made kennedy believe that another failure to stop communist expansion would fatally damage us credibility with its allies and his own reputation kennedy was thus determined to draw a line in the sand and prevent a communist victory in vietnam personal quotes  ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country  in a special address to congress i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth  inaugural address on joint ussoviet scientific ventures let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors  state of the union address in a very real sense it will not be one man going to the moon    it will be an entire nation for all of us must work to put him there let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty forgive your enemies but never forget their names  speech in west berlin germany two thousand years ago the proudest boast was civis romanus sum today in the world of freedom the proudest boast is ich bin ein berliner all free men wherever they may live are citizens of berlin and therefore as a free man i take pride in the words ich bin ein berliner i am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities we too will be remembered not for victories or defeats in battle or in politics but for our contributions to the human spirit victory has a thousand fathers but defeat is an orphan conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth privately about richard nixon richard nixons a conservative    and if he became president we could expect republican policy would switch to the right he is a filthy lying sonofabitch and a very dangerous man all my life ive known better than to depend on the experts  speech at rice university houston tx we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to measure and organize the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win and the others too on marlon brando the greatest womanizer who ever set foot in hollywood ten days before his assassination the high office of president has been used to foment a plot to destroy the americans freedom and before i leave office i must inform the citizen of his plight let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate harry s truman regards an open convention as one which studies all the candidates reviews their records and then takes his advice  in a commencement address the united states as the world knows will never start a war we do not want a war we do not now expect a war this generation of americans has already had enoughmore than enoughof war and hate and oppression we shall do our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just we are not helpless before the task or hopeless of its success confident and unafraid we must labor onnot towards a strategy of annihilation but towards a strategy of peace in the final analysis our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet we all breathe the same air we all cherish our childrens futures and we are all mortal our problems are manmade therefore they can be solved by man and man can be as big as he wants no problem of human destiny is beyond human beings the civil rights movement should thank god for eugene bull connor hes helped it as much as abraham lincoln after the bay of pigs invasion the advice of those who were brought in on the executive branch was unanimous and the advice was wrong and i was responsible  if anybody is around to write after this they are going to understand that we made every effort to find peace and every effort to give our adversary room to move i am not going to push the russians an inch beyond what is necessary in the fall of  i suppose if i win my poon days are over  joking with a supporter do you realize the responsibility i carry im the only person between richard nixon and the white house  we are probably strong enough to prevent one nation from unleashing nuclear weapons on another but we cant prevent infiltration assassination sabotage bribery any of the weapons of guerrilla warfare one guerrilla can pin down  conventional soldiers and weve got nothing equivalent in  to benjamin c bradlee on how he intended to announce the appointment of brother robert f kennedy to the position of us attorney general well i think ill open the door of the georgetown house some morning about  am look up and down the street and if theres no one there ill whisper its bobby november  this chimpanzee who is flying in space took off at  he reports that everything is perfect and working well  to theodore sorensen if we solve the berlin problem without war cuba will look pretty small and if there is a war cuba wont matter much either some people have their liberalism made by the time they reach their late s i didnt i was caught in crosscurrents and eddies it was only later that i got into the stream of things i must say in defense of our own country if the united states had not emphasized the military since  the shape of the globe would be very different than it is today so that those who feel that we overemphasize it might consider the fate of freedom if we had not emphasized it june   it is not enough to pin the blame on others to say this is the problem of one section of one country or another or deplore the fact that we face a great change is at hand and our task our obligation is to make that revolution than change peaceful and constructive for all those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality june   if an american because his skin is dark cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public if he cannot send his children to the best public school available if he cannot vote for the public officials who will represent him if in short he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay  too often in the past we have thought of the artist as an idler and dilettante and of the lover of arts as somehow sissy or effete we have done both an injustice the life of the artist is in relation to his work stern and lonely he has labored hard often among deprivation to perfect his skill he has turned aside from quick success in order to strip his vision of everything secondary or cheapening his working life is marked by intense application and intense discipline as for the lover of arts it is he who by subjecting himself to the sometimes disturbing experience of art sustains the artist  and seeks only the reward that his life will in consequence be the more fully lived it is only after you wield the powers of the presidency that you get hated wayne morse jimmy hoffa al hayes etc all hate me now merely because of one bill presidents are bound to be hated unless they are as bland as dwight d eisenhower november   upon arriving in dallas texas were really in nut country now march  i sometimes think we are too much impressed by the clamor of daily events newspaper headlines and the television screens give us a short view    yet it is the profound tendencies of history and not the passing excitements that will shape our future  once you say youre going to settle for second thats what happens to you in life i find on inauguration day january   the energy the faith the devotion which we bring to this endeavour will light our country and all who serve it  and the glow from that fire can truly light the world on inauguration day january   together let us explore the stars conquer the deserts tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce to  nobel prize winners who came for dinner this is the most extraordinary collection of talent that has ever gathered at the white housewith the possibility of when thomas jefferson dined alone we are tied to the ocean and when we go back to the sea whether it is to sail or watch  we are going back from whence we came we dont have a prayer of staying in vietnam those people hate us they are going to throw our asses out of there at any point
