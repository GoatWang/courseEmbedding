this moonless night lightning bugs flashed brilliantly in the yards along jordan drive moths fluttered around the hopelessly dim porch lights the air was warm and muggy darkness covered the neighborhoods workingclass splendor there wasnt a single siren to disturb the calm it was absolutely beautifulthis was the night their boyhood would end each would tell himself quietly not to cryallen iverson and crew tried to play cards like it was a normal night bubba chuck as hes known had taught them to play tonk he gave them what little money he had then would win it right back he was the most upbeat he made jokes to put others at ease this is what chuck did still it was his life that would change when the sun came upallen iverson was going to jail tomorrowthey sat around unsure of what to say they fired up the sega thinking tecmo bowl would provide the muchneeded distraction they put down the controllers within minutes the five heartbeats came on tv they watched in silenceit was all too much they were confused how did it get to this point they were scared chuck was scared which scared them most of all because he was never scaredjust after midnight iverson lay on his bed—his air force s still on—in his small room in the little blue house at  jordan drive there were michael jackson posters on his wall iversons lightness of being filled the room then suddenly he was a bolt of lightning a convoluted mashup of swagger naivete and confusionhe practiced the speech he would give the judge after receiving his slap on the wrist a burst of confidence followedhe was still chuckhe was still going to notre dame touchdown jesus would wait with open arms an ankle bracelet wouldnt be that bad his jeans would cover it when he went to the mall tawanna would still love him tomorrow she would kiss him when he got out of court he would come see her at work they could go to hardeesa slap on the wristhe had no idea how wrong he was well maybe some that judge he said lying back on

moore iversons longtime manager piloted the  coupe down the shoulder of the annoyingly packed thoroughfare when they were running late the shoulder became their personal hov lane moore was quite adept at dodging the many dangers of the road orange construction barrels potholes rocks and debris from fender benders he knew the shortcuts speed traps and the traffic lights that seemed to take foreverthey were in what moore called the danger zone which meant they had left iversons house at  or later he had to be at the arena at  he lived  minutes away on a good dayit could actually be dangerous getting iverson to games on time other motorists were always pulling onto the shoulder no one ever seemed to check the rearview before they did so the threat of traffic tickets was constant moore or whoever drove allen faced unrelenting constant pressure despite moores best laid plans there was never enough timetime was as precious a luxury as there could be in the world surrounding the leagues most polarizing player iverson was utterly unfazed by the daily emptying of the hourglass he actually preferred itif we werent rushing late iverson liked to say it just wouldnt feel rightiverson seemed to be comfortable in a constant state of semicontrolled chaos and everpercolating melodrama it either focused or pleasantly distracted him no one really knewin the front seat next to moore he casually talked on his cell phone and dealt with the annoyances that came along with being one of the most famous basketball players in the world—requests for tickets money and time family squabbles trade rumors bad press sometimes it was his wife tawanna whom he had kissed goodbye not  minutes beforeon this day mo—as iverson called moore—couldnt work his magic and proved less than equal to phillys unforgiving traffic snarls iverson arrived at the arena  minutes before tipoff sixers coach larry brown was furious he had been looking for a reason to trade him spent many hours in sixers general manager billy kings office complaining about iverson brown said iverson never listened to him allen hated that he insisted he heard every word he would definitely hear what brown said next he walked up to allen and spoke in a low controlled tone he told iverson that this was the last straw either you go or i gogetty imagesprologue iiihe owned hotels on park place boardwalk and even marvin gardens—not to mention a controlling interest in the electric company those little red plastic buildings in the high rent district meant he was firmly in controlthe team was staying in charlottesville that night hours earlier bethel high had captured the  virginia state boys basketball championship behind iversons verve and moxie that was a distant memory now his teammates had gathered in his hotel room to engage in one of his lifelong passions monopolyhis trial was still four months away but you couldnt tell as he moved his game piece—the vintage boot—and wagged a wad full of goldcolored  bills he was ruthless and cunning he talked trash and dared people to land on his property he smiled as he cut side deals with other players to eliminate threats to his budding empire the game was in its second hour when the phenom tucked his stash in his pockethold up iverson said i gotta go do somethingthe best basketball player in the state got up and left the room he propped the door open with the latch and walked barefoot down the carpeted hallway he stopped at the last door and knockedallen whats up asked his high school coach michael bailey after answering the door is everything all rightthe coach had a number of family members in town after chatting with baileys relatives for several minutes he walked iverson to the door the coach and the player hugged he noticed the play money in his pocketyou sure youre ok asked baileyi just wanted to make sure i talked to you before you went to bed he answereda random act of iversonbailey would experience a dozen of them in the years to come it would take him the better part of a decade to figure out they werent random at all last summer iverson picked up the phone and called baileyallen is everything all right the coach would ask instinctively everything is fine coach iverson replied i just wanted to hear your voicegetty imagesits been said that life is just a series of snapshots glimpses of things that have been tiny personal moments that begin to reveal the measure of a man whether he was sublime or insignificant is of no consequenceiversons story is an ofttold one but that wellworn dogeared narrative—one to which we clung so desperately—was always slightly out of focus to the informed it lacked contexttoo many snapshots missing the blank spaces replaced instead by assumption disregard and resentment toward the thing we couldnt figure outhis transcendent talent was always the lure but his complexity his truth led us to real emotional paydirt he was an otherworldly athlete we could connect withhe defined toughness yet was easily wounded his pain was equal parts burden and badge of honor it calloused to become an impenetrable shell he used it to survivewe fetishized his authenticity while giving him complete control over its application then we had the audacity to find fault with the finished productexpressing himself was often a clumsy anxious proposition he would rant he would cry he would brood a plume of emotion left across the sky this was the same beautifully flawed boy who sparked a revolution without intentionat his best he burned charm when he did he was irresistible we wanted more he doled it out in small portions because it was never really for us we watched with envious eyes as he stuck his finger in the face of conformity while never realizing the personal cost of his defiancei was the first one do all that stuff and i took an asswhooping for it says iverson tattoos cornrows headbands hiphop i never meant to start any trends i got my butt kicked but if that meant that the guys who came after me could be themselves then it was worth itallen iverson didnt just defy conventions he reinvented them he gave birth to a generation who gave him love where none had existed beforegetty imagesi didnt want to be michael or magic says lebron james i wanted to be allen iversonhe changed everything carmelo anthony says an entire generation owes himchris paul calls him simply the most influential player of all timehe wasnt perfect an icon in wolfs clothing but there was so much of allen iverson in us—that was both scary and comfortinghe flew the flag of the underdog and planted it firmly where it made you the most uncomfortable you dont have enough snapshots to understandhe was woefully misunderstood our fault not his but it was the very thing that forged his resolve like fire on steel he kept us at arms length he didnt need us yet still he was ours and that we quietly loved above all thingsallen iverson on the night the sixers retired his no

white dorag and a backward yankees fitted theres a gold diamondstudded rolex on his right wristin other words its allen iversonhis cheeks are a little fuller and damn if he aint an inch shorter from when you last met but its him his familiar expressive round eyes that for so long broadcast his pain to the world are particularly brightin a rare lengthy wideranging interview iverson displays a myriad of emotions while bouncing from subject to subject crashing into questions with both abandon and care he is warm funny and talkative he doesnt miss an opportunity to land a comedic jab at his interviewer hes got a holster full of zingers and revels in a direct hitiverson says he has rededicated himself to his family and worked hard to manage the vices that have caused so much turmoil in his life he divorced in  but says his primary focus is rebuilding his relationship with his partner of  yearsweve had ups downs good times bad times been divorced apart together everything he says of tawanna his high school sweetheart exwife and mother of his five children were going to be together forever thats the way its gonna behe lives quietly outside of miami the dewy sweet air agrees with him as do the warm breezes off the ocean that gently rattle the neighborhood palms that line his green bucolic suburb on a typical day iverson gets up at about seven—six if his human alarm clock children wake him up he helps get the kids ready for school tawanna brushes their hair he fixes breakfast their homework is usually packed the night before he drops them off at school most days then runs an errand or two back at home hell check emails or return phone callshe likes to be outside to stave off claustrophobia he needs to keep moving he looks for things to keep him busyyou need me to go to the store you need me to make a run hell ask tawannahe goes to his kids gymnastic competitions basketball games and school functions holidaythemed plays and the yearend talent shows are his favoriteiverson says hes a regular dad nownathaniel s butlergetty imagesim just a regular  dad now he says im doing the things that i never paid attention to they never had a fulltime father but they do now im here for those things now being older i cant imagine a parent not wanting to be in their kids life i will just never understand it to me its pricelesson a typical lazy afternoon hell jump on the computer google a few things maybe a vacation spot sometimes hell search youtube for hours looking for funny videosone of his daily goals is to laugh thats why i hang around idiots he jokes his friend kian pennington sitting next to him in the boardroom misses the joke and looks dazed see i surround myself with people who make me laughhe drives more now than at any period in his life if he needs toothpaste or paper towels he goes to the store to get it if his car needs gas he pumps it he loves broccoli still listens to brandy he checks the mailbox hes a big fan of ronda rouseycould you beat her in the octagon i askhell no he says and i aint trying to find outin the afternoon he picks the kids up from school and gets them ready for dinner in the evening he and tawanna will watch a movie or two before going to sleepi live such a normal life he says i absolutely love ituntil the bowling alley incident—a brawl that eventually led to iverson a yearold being convicted as an adult of

neighborhood that he was looking for bubba chuck problem was no one had seen him but that wasnt unusual he was known to disappear sometimes youd have to try a halfdozen places before the kid would turn up they had been teammates in youth football but for the past week he was a ghost michael jackson despite being  years old had developed a reputation as something of a capable barber around the neighborhood though opinions of his work variedone day chuck asked him to borrow the very clippers jackson used to make a name for himself so he loaned his yearold friend allen iverson his beloved shears he expected them back the next day jackson had taken them from his fathers cabinet without asking and there would be consequences a week passed then a few more dayssoon jackson knew he would never see those clippers again he lived a minute walk from chucks house on jordan drive but still couldnt track him down jackson never quite knew when he was staying there sometimes his mom ann would answer the doorone day he saw the kid sauntering down the streethey chuck said jackson i need my clippers backthe kid was as quick on his feet as he was on a naked bootleg so jackson was ready for any possible excusemy grandmothers house burned down said chuck without hesitation the clippers were insidejackson bought ithe knew he would have to answer to his father but it hardly mattered he liked chuck they had bumped heads competed like mad argued over this fussed over that they ran sprints together on the field behind aberdeen elementary chuck was fast jackson was faster they were complete opposites one wore dorags and liked to rap the other wore dress slacks and was in student council they were born to hate each otherchuck loved him from the startclose friends for decades michael jackson no  and iverson no courtesy of michael jacksontheir world opened up in the th grade when they turned  and jacksons father gave him a  toyota tercel with no ac that he spraypainted black they dubbed it the jack mobilethat thing was a piece of st says iverson but we went everywhere in it we loved that car it was the greatest it created so many memories for usjackson would pick iverson up before school and they would sing boyz ii men or jodeci the whole ride hoping the tape wouldnt pop they drove it to practice to pick up food to the coliseum mall to buy sneakersone afternoon iverson stopped by jacksons to tell him about a girl he met at a party he got the number she didnt know who he was he called right away he was so excited he went on and on man she was so pretty her hair was pretty her skin was pretty her eyes were pretty i never met a girl like this she wasnt acting like other girls she was just sitting there not acting pressed or nothing she was different man—just differenttawanna turner was a grade above allen she went to kecoughtan high across town and was quiet smart and didnt take lip from anyone she was far from impressed with the skinny boy with the raspy voice and clever words but he was willing to workshe was a sales clerk at deejays a trendy clothing store in the coliseum mall every boy wanted to date a girl who worked there because the prettiest girls in the city worked there ones social standing would soar with the simple act of securing a phone number boys were known to go to the store and try on three or four outfits as a ruse to get to know one of the sales girls they seemed to always have boyfriends thoughtawanna lived on the other side of town in a nice neighborhood and iverson would often sneak into her house long after her parents fell asleep to be with her he would call jackson to come pick him up at all hours of the night hed head down mercury boulevard and make that left on fox hill road he knew the trip front to backi used to get him in so much trouble remembers iversonone time after being scooped up around three in the morning iverson sat in the passenger seat of the jack mobile and was strangely quiet jackson knew he wanted to say somethingi really like this girl iverson finally said shes justthats cool replied jackson you guys are great togetheri think i love her iverson continued for realit wasnt unusual for iverson to be attached to whomever he was dating but jackson had never heard iverson say he loved a girl before and was slightly taken abackthats great chuckman you not hearing me iverson

practices and appearances he became one of the nbas most visible nononsense gatekeepers it was moores decision to hire personal security when he thought iversons nightlife was getting out of hand hes been present for nearly every milestone in iversons careergod sent me to him all those years ago he likes to say he was the son i never hadwithout mo i would have never made it says iverson you would have never heard of mewhen iverson turned pro moore kept his job as a purchasing agent at hampton university iverson would call every day sometimes three or four times a day life was off without moore he never knew how much money he had he didnt know how his reebok deal worked his first agent david falk never told him anything he would pay whatever a dealer asked for a car iverson hated to hagglemoore  was frustrated with iversons carelessness with money iverson asked him to leave hampton and come to philly moore says he told iverson he would oblige but only if they did it legit he drew up a contract which outlined his duties and paid him a modest salary that both he and iverson signediverson trusted him above all othersafter all moore had helped design iversons deferred payment

newport news and was good enough that he had hopes of going pro but chronic knee pain put an end to his diamond dreams and he settled in nearby aberdeen and began coaching youth league footballhe had known ann iverson as a teenager from the neighborhood but they ran with different crowds in his late s he got a job as a forklift operator at an avon cosmetics distribution plant where ann worked in

he would reverse field just to make it more challenging his toothpick arm could fling the ball  yards through the summer aireven as kids we could tell he was different says jackson anyone who says otherwise is lyingiverson would play five seasons under moore up until the time he enrolled in hamptons bethel high when his home life would unravel which it often did he would stay with moore he had

iverson to tie a tie and would eventually buy him suits for the significant moments in his life his sentencing his announcement to go pro the day he was draftedmoore would drive him to school and pick him up from practice that was the easiest way to watch him then allen would disappear he always didwhen he wasnt right in front of me i was always concerned says moore never worried—i put my worries on god—but definitely concernedthe streets were one thing but what moore really feared was the pervasive racial tension that seemed to hover over hampton like a toxic fog as a teenager moores father told him never to go to the bowling alley there was just so much racist activity there says moore i never set foot in that placeblack boys were told by their elders not to venture into poquoson the pejoratively termed redneck part of town by themselves the nword would drop like molotovs from moving cars once you crossed pine chapel road and went over the bridge you were in unwelcome territorybut invincible athletes werent concerned with the lessons of those who came before they just loved to bowl on valentines day in the winter of  the night of the most notorious event in recent peninsula history jackson waited at teammate xavier gunns house for their friends to return from circle laneswhen the boys returned they didnt seem worried in fact they were hardly worked up they started to play cards but first iverson called moore told him he didnt do anything that he wasnt involved in the fight at all but he was allen iverson so it didnt matterallen said moore just after midnight were going to need a lawyergetty imageschapter five the night he swerved past deathtawanna wanted to do something special for his birthday this was the big  they had been together for half his life they had three children and another on the way she arranged to buy three cars—one for each decade of his life there was the white droptop bentley coupe the matte gray lamborghini murcielago and the mercedes amg when he arrived home one afternoon they were arranged in a row like a car showthis amused some in his circle because even though iverson loved cars he rarely drove he had been driven to just about every game practice appearance restaurant or club hed ever been to no one was actually sure if he even had a licenseallen just really couldnt drive that well says moorebut when he needed them one particular day he summoned some driving skills that likely saved his lifeless than a mile from his house on a winding treelined road iverson crested a small hill that sharply banked right at the top preventing motorists from seeing oncoming traffic to drivers in either direction a small amount of faith was required until clear sight lines were restorediverson was nearly at the top when an oncoming car emerged in his lane headed straight for the white bentley he had just gotten for his birthday neither iverson nor the other driver had time to apply the brakes without a headon collisioniverson instantaneously yanked the wheel to the right missing the car by inches sending the bentley careening off the road he hadnt touched the brakes without losing any speed the car was headed for a massive yearold elm treethe car fishtailed wildlyiverson yanked the wheel back to the left and was able to steer out of the tailspin in the dewy grass when the car came to rest he and jackson sat in silence hearts racing trying to get a handle on the momentthat could have been it said a shaken iverson still gripping the wheel just like that it could have been overiverson wasnt wearing his seat belt he never didif not for his reflexes we would probably be dead says jackson ive never seen him react like that something was guiding his handiverson steered the car back onto the empty road and made a uturn to head back home he pulled in the driveway jumped out of the car and ran to the front door he burst into the house and called out for tawanna with a desperate voice when she came down the staircase he pulled her close and hugged her tightly without saying a word the children ambled into the room curious why dad was back so soon he embraced them one by onewhen his nerves settled iverson got back into the car as tawanna and the children stood in the doorway he looked at the children and thought about the moments in his life there was prom night when he was decked out in an allwhite tux moore helped iverson put on his bow tie tawanna radiated in a fuchsia sequin dress the beatup toyota with tinted windows and rims that someone loaned him did just finethere was his wedding night the newlyweds danced their first dance to musiq soulchilds dreamy track love tawanna put her arms over his shoulder her left hand on the back of allens head iverson put his chin on her shoulder and closed his eyes her parents cried anns heart glowed they swayed slowly iverson placed his left hand protectively in the small of her back she raised her right hand to the

and sighsseventeenyearold allen iverson was tried and convicted as an adult of maiming by mob in via nprorgespnlost in the carnage of what many in hindsight see as injustice was the fact that iversons football career was effectively over something that angers moore to this dayhe was a far better football player than a basketball player says moore far far better we talked about notre dame all the time that was our dream we watched the fighting irish on tv every saturday he was never supposed to be in the nba we were focused on the nfl he should be in canton as we speakpeople in the area still debate whether or not michael vick or iverson was the better quarterbacktwentytwo years later the wounds are still raw the thoughts bubbling just beneath the surface are bad enough still he tries to brush it offits no big deal he says just above a whisper water under the bridgewhen he was sentenced i knew i would do one thing says jackson i was on a mission through education i had to put myself in a position to give him a job if he ever needed onelast may jackson completed his doctorate in education at ohio state and works as a principal in the columbus school systemon iversons first night of freedom they gathered at gunns house and tried to reclaim normalcy they didnt ask him what it was like he didnt tell them about screams that echoed throughout the prison all night or fires people would start or how the prison guards would try to intimidate he didnt tell them how lonely he wasive tried to delete all those memories out of my head says iverson i want to put those times behind me where i dont have to speak about it anymorethey played cards for hours before breaking out the monopoly set before long it was late and the boys were getting tired as iverson packed up the game he

picked up the  mvp even if he did remember hes adamant iversons clothes didnt matterthose things bothered other people in our organization more than it did me he says but i think iverson endeared

shirt with a collar end of dress codewas race a factor i askour league was always on the razors edge with race says stern but in a good way in that we were at the forefront of a national discussion

steve javie following a game between the nuggets and iversons former team the philadelphia ers played january   during the course of the game iverson committed two technical fouls and was ejected from the game after the game iverson said i thought i got fouled on that play and i said i thought that he was calling the game personal i should have known that i couldnt say anything anyway its been something personal with me and him since i got in the league this was just the perfect game for him to try and make me look bad former referee tim donaghy supported the claim that javie had a longstanding hatred for iverson in his book personal foul a firstperson account of the scandal that rocked the nba which a florida business group published through a selfpublishing arm of amazoncom after it was dropped by a division of random house who cited liability issues after reviewing the manuscript in a december  interview with  minutes donaghy said he and fellow referees thought the punishment was too light before iversons nuggets played the utah jazz on january   donaghy said he and the two other officials working the game agreed not to give iverson favorable calls as a way to teach him a lesson iverson attempted  free throws more than any other player on either team on  drives to the basket he drew five fouls three of which donaghy whistled himself and did not receive a

k shares share tweet sms send email by kent babb  july   excerpted from not a game the incredible rise and unthinkable fall of allen iverson by kent babb published by atria books book can be purchased online at amazon there he went house to house hoping he would find the little shit it was sunday evening the sun setting in coastal virginia and mike bailey’s patience was eroding by the second he should have known better no doubt about it now nope coach he’s not here sorry coach you just missed him bailey was the basketball coach at bethel high school in hampton virginia a city on a peninsula that juts into the atlantic ocean and after two decades he was familiar with the maze of teenage psychology now he was seething played like a fool by a kid these were the kinds of things that made him distrust iverson bailey thought to himself practicing what he would say when he finally found him this was why the kid’s word wasn’t worth a damn three days earlier iverson had asked to go home just one weekend coach he wanted to see his mother and his friends bailey had gotten to know iverson’s delicate family situation and he knew the kid had a chance to do something amazing two years earlier the coach first watched the eighthgrade point guard on the junior varsity team he was so fast driving to the basket with such ease the kid was a blur and the other boys could not move fast enough to get in front of him or put a hand in his face and damn there he went again iverson would have a chance at a college scholarship bailey just knew it a rare opportunity to lift himself and his family out of here but there was so much work to be done a total construction job and the first time he had met iverson they argued about school absences ten of them the policy went led to sports ineligibility bailey told iverson he had missed seventysix days of classes nah coach the kid corrected proudly it was only sixtynine after iverson’s freshman year bailey had fallen for iverson and his future enough that he and janet bailey’s wife had gone allin paying for iverson to attend summer school allowing him to live with them and walking the highwire act of iverson enrolled in a session in which one absence meant failure and sports ineligibility – a highpowered train coming off the tracks now with bailey kicking himself for allowing himself to become so enchanted the kid was nowhere to be found he searched one house and then the next his eyes scanning the sidewalks and playgrounds and alleyways yeah coach we just saw him bailey turned his car toward home and the next morning he walked into the school and saw iverson sitting in class later that day he noticed iverson walking alone “come here” the coach demanded iverson walked over and bailey pulled him into a dimly lit room grabbing the kid by the throat “if you mess this thing up” bailey said “i’ll kill you” she moved into hampton’s aberdeen district when she was still pregnant fifteen years old and a live wire look at her go running through the neighborhood which decades earlier had been part of resettlement legislation for some of the virginia peninsula’s black residents and now it was a kind of community within a community the neighbors appreciated the quiet but here she came bursting from her grandmother’s doorway yet again her voice carried down the streets and through the windows that round belly pulling up her basketball jersey ann iverson kept running in the months after she celebrated her fifteenth birthday by going all the way with allen broughton the boy she had met three years earlier in hartford connecticut the boy who seemed to never keep his distance from trouble the boy ann just could not resist they had talked about it first love first kiss first fuck – it all went together didn’t it and so when she felt she was old enough he would tap on her grandmother’s back window at midnight of her birthday and then they would go down to the basement broughton had played basketball and earned the respect of men much older than him ann loved him would fight for him would do anything – and then he was just gone not coming around anymore even after the basketball trainer told ann that her physical revealed she was two months pregnant that would not stop her though from slamming doors and playing ball and bothering the neighbors then ann’s mama died and her grandmother ethel mitchell moved the family to the virginia coast quieter environs the old woman hoped for a granddaughter known around the streets as “juicy” she went into labor in early june and when her son came out she noticed the length of his arms he was going to be a basketball player she thought almost immediately or at least that was what she would tell people she thought she named him allen after his daddy and her first love but she would call him bubba chuck combining two uncles’ names ann found stimulation even in aberdeen and other times she brought the party to miss ethel’s house the old woman trying to keep young allen asleep or at least shielded from the ruckus in the other room bubba chuck grew and like his mother he liked to go fast jumping on a tenspeed at four and five years old roughhousing with his uncles greg and stevie in the backyard as miss ethel screamed for them to stop for god’s sake y’all gonna break that boy in two “they would sling the hell out of his little ass up against the house or something” said butch harper who lived next door “he would take the hardest damn hit and he’d pop right back up” ann worked evenings at the shipyard taking on daytime jobs as a typist and a forklift driver miss ethel was looking after the kids ann and her siblings included and it was up to ann to keep the lights on she worked most times and even when she was off she was not home – ­another party to attend even if the fun came back to aberdeen or later their home in newport news a few miles northeast on the peninsula often there was a man with her michael freeman who did mysterious things to make ends meet before they disappeared for the night or a few days they put a ball in bubba chuck’s hand and watched him go and when he was nine ann called harper her old neighbor and begged him to waive the rule that kids had to live in hampton to play in hampton where harper oversaw the deen ball sports league ann was so excited about it telling the other mamas and daddies at work about how her son was so good he was going to play in the nba just wait one of those people in earshot heard the commotion one day the enthusiasm common but the details intriguing gary moore was a coach for harper working with football players and he liked what he was hearing he wanted to take a look at this little dynamo and so he put nineyearold bubba on the field with eleven and twelveyearolds pushing the ball between his arms and – hot damn look at him go “he was kicking so much ass man it was ridiculous” harper would recall more than two decades later moore vowed to ann that he would do more than coach her son he would look after him protect him shield him from the sharks that would forever circle him he would see to it that he would be challenged and disciplined and sheltered the way moore looked at it a kid with bubba chuck’s gifts needed to be nurtured and strengthened mentally and physically built from the ground up like a house meant to stand for all time my word moore told ann just picture what that finished product would look like and she smiled and hooted and shook her head thanking god for giving her this baby this gift who would use those long arms to lift them all up and carry them toward a much better place they rolled the balls out at the aberdeen gym and off iverson went during warmups toward the basket draining longrange shots from the wing flying past the kids trying to guard him then it was time for practice to start and bob barefield announced they were going to spend the next hour working on drills a few workouts to teach proper mechanics and footwork and when barefield started the lesson there went bubba chuck walking out the door basketball was fun not work and practice to him felt a hell of a lot like work so no thanks he told the coach and if this was what it meant to play for the youth league then they could keep the damn youth league barefield was stunned but he tried to be patient as he monitored a kid who needed constant stimulation barefield talked iverson into taking a leap of faith with him and the kid obliged but iverson saw himself not only as an athlete but as a multitalented youngster with more than just his speed and jump shot to offer the world he liked football better anyway and besides he was going to be an artist or a rapper he met rahsaan langford a kid from the east side of town everyone called him ra he could freestyle with the best of them turning everyday thoughts and dusty old memories into a stream of rhymes spitting them on stoops and street corners and playgrounds the words lightning fast like bubba chuck was with the basketball maybe for the first time in iverson’s young life he was jealous ra was talented the same as his new friend and together they were going to make it out of newport bad newz they came to call it langford was quiet around strangers but when he felt comfortable he would brighten the room or the corner keeping iverson and the rest of their group laughing and like iverson langford and several other friends never wanted to go home that was where ann’s parties were where drinking and drug use packed the hours and iverson would develop a habit that would later come to haunt him rather than spend the nighttime hours sleeping he would stay awake finding fulfillment or entertainment in other ways sometimes ann would ask bubba chuck to run an errand for the group and off he would go once knocking on the door of a drug house and walking in as a police surveillance unit watched from out front one of the officers a former athlete at bethel called up dennis kozlowski the high school’s football coach and athletic director tipping him off that iverson had entered a house filled with unsavory characters and had left with his hands full the cops cut him a break maybe the first time but hardly the last time an authority figure would look the other way and iverson walked home and delivered the package he spent his hours dreaming of a different kind of life and putting his imagination on paper – sometimes using whatever else was available when there was no paper within reach iverson once used the inside of his bedroom door as a canvas sketching an image from above as michael jordan his idol glided through the air the chicago bulls’ star flying toward the basket and his jersey flapping like a flag in the wind other times he would grab a ball the noise in the other rooms too much and dribble it up the sidewalks occasionally there were other boys on the playground even in the wee hours and other nights he would stand there alone taking shot after shot by himself other times he and ra and eric “e” jackson and marlon moore the young men iverson would later identify as his allimportant “dayone friends” would sit on a stoop or take a long walk they were in it together calling themselves “cru thik” born and raised on the hard streets of coastal virginia but by god they would not die here young and unfulfilled and worst of all poor they passed the hours and made a pact if any of them ever made it big whether it was through rap or sports or something else the group would never dissolve if one made it out then they all would iverson was in ninth grade when kozlowski’s wide receivers coach entered his boss’s office and closed the door iverson’s school absences had already become a problem basketball coach bailey arguing with iverson over the precise number of the dozens of times he had missed school now even when he did make it to campus he rarely arrived before eleven in the morning even early in the school year he had missed the assistant coach’s early morning history class nine times one more the coach told kozlowski and he would have no choice but to fail iverson making him ineligible to play for the bruins hold on kozlowski told his assistant he would get to the bottom of it he called iverson into his office getting quickly to the point “allen” the coach asked “why the hell can’t you get to school on time” the kid seemed to not even realize he had missed class so often but he explained anyway ann and freeman the man she met at the shipyard and who had begun attracting attention for selling drugs now had two younger daughters brandy and iiesha and after ann moved out of miss ethel’s house there was often no one around to look after them kozlowski had heard things were occasionally bad at home the lights occasionally shut off and for a while a broken pipe pushed so much raw sewage up through the floor that iverson wore boots while moving from one room to the next what his coaches had not realized was that iverson making it to school at any hour was many times a small miracle he collected enough pennies to call a taxi then asked friends for a lift home to his house on jordan avenue and other times he called a coach at four thirty in the morning and asked for a ride even at age fifteen he had grown used to waking up and being unable to find or awaken his mother and if brandy was to make it to school it was up to him to get her there but then if iverson went to classes who would watch iiesha who was born with a condition that afflicted her with seizures most mornings iverson saw brandy onto the school bus and then sat with his baby sister until ann came home and only then would he wander to school himself christ kozlowski thought and depending on perspective this was either giving a young and talented kid a second chance because of unusual challenges or just another time iverson was insulated from responsibility because of his skills on a football field and basketball court nevertheless kozlowski instructed one of bethel’s security workers a former highjumper on kozlowski’s track team to take kozlowski’s car – the buick reliant wagon the coach pointed out with “koz” as the license plate – and each morning stop at iverson’s house gathering the three children he would then drop brandy off at her school and bring iverson and iiesha to the high school where the baby would spend the hours in the care of bethel’s home economics class iverson felt at home when the games began the fields and courts the one place no one worried about him and sometimes spent nights with friends an attempt to find peace after the sun went down one of iverson’s mentors a twentyyearold former athlete named tony clark allowed iverson to stay with him some nights imparting advice and wisdom into iverson’s young mind but then clark’s girlfriend came over one night and stabbed clark in the neck iverson running over and seeing his friend’s blood running in the street iverson watched as another boy took a bullet as they sat together on a porch and it was said that in one summer eight of his friends were shot to death many times moore offered a spare room and a ride from here to there iverson came to trust moore who years earlier had played football for kozlowski he was already in his late thirties older even than ann iverson and moore projected himself as wise and thoughtful a fatherly aura that iverson was immediately drawn to and moore was among those who believed greatness was in his protégé’s destiny no matter the attempts at stability iverson moved around so often that he held precious the smallest reminders of comfort and peace before the family moved out of its house in newport news iverson stared at the drawing he had done of jordan dreaming of someday controlling his own destiny a gift that a professional athlete must surely take for granted when they left the house they gathered their meager belongings packing them into trash bags and preparing for the next step – whatever it might look like iverson took a screwdriver to the hinge plate pulling the door off its frame iverson’s biological father allen broughton was serving a prison term the first of several – including one sentence in  for stabbing an exgirlfriend – and the first time iverson met him it was with guards watching the boy asked his dad if there was any way he could help him get a new pair of sneakers and broughton told iverson that there was no way sending the boy home shattered but ann came up with an alternative plan she used that month’s rent money to buy her young son the shoes before a summerleague trip to lawrence kansas where one of the men who would stop to watch iverson was a college coach named larry brown ann maintained a relationship with freeman who attempted to be a father figure but he also would spend most of the next two decades in prison the investigations finally turning up enough evidence to convict him on drug charges iverson looked to moore and his coaches as the stable men in his life and when he and bailey concluded their conversation about school absences the basketball coach asked him a question whose answer was both revealing and heartbreaking considering what bailey had come to know about his young star “what do you expect of me” bailey asked iverson thought about it before answering “will you always be there for me” during summers ann iverson trusted her son with boo williams a former power forward at st john’s who now ran his own amateur athletic union team alonzo mourning had come and gone through williams’s system moving on to georgetown university and future stardom and iverson was his next project a kid with so much talent and speed and… my god allen do you ever shut up fourteen hours that was how long he talked from hampton to memphis teammate and future university of maryland star joe smith going to sleep to pass the time in some way other than listening to iverson’s impressions and jokes and continual wisdom but when he woke up iverson was still jabbering he was going out to tennessee where the new arena was a damn pyramid – had they seen it – and iverson was going to help them christen that place watch how many points he scored how easy it would be for him to get to the basket how many shots in a row he would make and anyway did anybody want to bet just a buck or two chump change come on coaches learned early on that iverson was an incentivebased organism ask him to do something and he was just as likely to do it as tell you to go fuck yourself but add five dollars to the equation or a payperview movie in the hotel room or pizza instead of some bullshit boxed chicken and now you had a damn machine eager ready to please he bet on free throws and bowling and latenight monopoly marathons iverson always the banker to see to it nobody would steal always the one with the fat stack of phony money when the night was finished but he had won goddammit and that was what mattered could he not dunk at age thirteen flying through the air and going above the rim on a regulation goal “we don’t play that ymca shit” harper said much later had iverson not scored thirty points three games in a row at the aau nationals in winstonsalem north carolina – not just in each game but by halftime propelling him to the top of the national recruiting rankings “what he did will never be done” williams would recall “and i’ve been in this thirtytwo years” iverson was going to show them in memphis too he kept telling them the teammates and coaches in that little van feeling trapped inside a cloud of iverson’s nonstop chatter damn did the kid not sleep did his batteries never run low fuck nah he replied did michael’s did mike’s batteries ever run low he hoped not because he was ready to play mike now leave him in the dust whatever williams told him michael evans was a solid player not just the best point guard in eastern virginia but one of the best in america keep practicing allen and maybe in a year or two you’ll… “i wasn’t talking about no michael evans” iverson crowed “who are you talking about then” “shit i’m talking about michael jordan” they rolled their eyes and when they finally rolled into memphis and that pyramid iverson and the boo williams undersixteen team tore through the competition – well most of it – and finished second iverson was named most valuable player and that was great and all but that meant it was time to go home another fourteen hours of iverson radio all the hits from today and yesterday and commercials for tomorrow that was some bullshit he said early in the drive talking about the secondplace trophy threatening to throw the damn thing out the window as they plowed down interstate  “allen” somebody said “will you shut up if we stop somewhere for dinner” he smiled something in it for him now and for a long time he did not say another word bailey took his hand off iverson’s throat in that darkened back room the kid’s eyes finally returning to their normal size bailey came to understand his star player’s challenges or at least he tried to understand them but he also made it clear he bailey would not be played more than that he would not allow iverson’s questionable support system – and the destructive lessons and twisted sense of normalcy he had come to accept throughout his upbringing – to derail such a promising future iverson saw toughness as strength writing off those who took it easy on him as soft and a mark to take advantage of the easier you took it on him the harder he made life on you so bailey began taking inventory of all things iverson collecting intel from friendly teachers and monitoring iverson’s grades as they were posted at the end of his freshman year he took a d and would need to attend summer school iverson’s mother though could not afford the tuition and so bailey made iverson a deal live with bailey and janet his wife for those three weeks sharpening his focus and completing his requirements and the baileys would pay for the summer session iverson liked an incentive didn’t he so here it was like it or not iverson agreed and the first four days had come and gone without incident then by thursday evening iverson’s mind began to wander no matter the actions and intentions of those surrounding him those who had known him and believed in him since the beginning would always be dear and no one was more precious than ann no matter her own bad behavior because she had always seen greatness in her son iverson wanted to spend the weekend at home but bailey balked at the idea “allen” he had said “we had a deal” the kid smiled though showing a kind of charm that would later make him into an international icon and charismatic pitchman beneath the toughness was a sweetness inside one that prevented those who cared deeply for him from ever writing him off and iverson kept chirping at his coach he reminded bailey that one of his coaching principles was trust – trusting teammates to do their jobs developing oncourt trust that assignments would be completed trusting coaches to put players in the best possible positions “why don’t you trust me” iverson had asked the words ate at him but bailey held on tired fingers gradually popping free of the ledge iverson was relentless he caught his basketball coach walking around a corner “coach” the kid said “trust” he saw him in the kitchen and in hallways “trust” he said again and again and fine bailey said agreeing to allow iverson to spend the weekend with his family – but only if he was back by sunday then of course sunday had come and gone iverson nowhere to be found and bailey making his way through hampton and having no luck then there he was and bailey snapped “i’ll kill you” he said reaching deep into iverson’s soul for the next ten days iverson had perfect attendance at summer school if bailey spoke with ann she would align herself with the coach and not her son no matter how she carried on ann rarely questioned the motives of those who made her son’s future a priority and she had taught her son pride while iverson lived with the baileys they noticed him rise early and ask to borrow an iron he worked the shirt’s creases and edges draping it over his shoulders and turning to reveal a hole in the back there was nothing he could do about the hole he figured but he refused to attend school with a wrinkled shirt “whatever he had” mike bailey recalled “he valued tremendously” iverson and his coaches still clashed occasionally a look into the future and bailey threw him off the varsity team three times before the storms passed and bailey sent him back into the lineup kozlowski required that all players wear a suit on game day and when he learned that iverson owned no suit kozlowski spent five hundred dollars for his quarterback to be outfitted in a twopiece by the next year one of ann’s houseguests had stolen the suit from iverson’s closet and koz­lowski bought him a replacement on the promise that iverson would attend the newport news daily press’s athlete of the year banquet on time iverson with moore as his chauffeur arrived at seven fifteen for the six o’clock banquet the day before virginia’s group aaa state championship football game during iverson’s junior year at bethel he organized something of a walkout kozlowski had called for a practice and it was cold and snowy and iverson did not feel like practicing in such weather iverson the bruins’ starting quarterback approached kozlowski “coach” he said “everybody’s sick we shouldn’t be out here” it was a note iverson would play many times throughout his nba career someone he cared about having come down with a mysterious and sudden illness then a day or so later it was gone and iverson would return to practice pulling on his green and gold but this time kozlowski swatted away his star player’s excuse moving forward with the walkthrough a halfspeed tuneup scheduled to last an hour punt team kozlowski called and iverson took his place as the return man the kick went up and the coverage team ran toward him positioning their feet to close down the avenues the quick iverson usually tried to exploit but as they approached iverson he just stood there one more time called kozlowski growing annoyed now the punt went up then downward then into iverson’s arms and he stood there again refusing to return it kozlowski threatened to bench iverson going so far as to have the backup quarterback warm up and take a few snaps but iverson and kozlowski both knew the old coach was not going to gamble away his chance to win a state championship to underscore a life lesson for his junior quarterback in sports the game results prevail and years later kozlowski would show little regret for allowing iverson to play because in a wall near the bar in his home’s trophy room was a plaque from the bruins’ – win against lynchburg’s e c glass high school iverson naturally scored one of bethel’s touchdowns on a punt return when a local reporter pushed a microphone into his face afterward iverson tugged at his stocking cap and smiled “i’m gonna go get one in basketball now” he said tawanna turner asked kim woodard if she could come over that night and meet the boy who played football with kim’s boyfriend tim johnson was he the one on tv always running his mouth who did he think he was tawanna was hesitant to say it out loud but she wanted to know in fact she did not say much of anything out loud tawanna was quiet and he was brash she kept to herself and he always seemed to have his crew close by he was an athlete at bethel high and she was the manager for the girls’ basketball team at hampton’s kecoughtan high fetching water and towels for the players some of whom were tawanna’s friends she was as iverson would later tease her for a water girl they could not have been more different but they were both juniors they were both sixteen and opposites attract don’t they and besides here they were because they were friends with some of the same people kim and tim wasn’t that funny kecoughtan had a half day of school and kim set it all up tim asked iverson to come over and meet the girl with the hoop earrings and the quiet way what the hell iverson thought beats going home for the night they talked for a while iverson quiet now and tawanna chattering talking about how her daddy called her by her first two initials “td” like a touchdown and insisting she had dated only one athlete before and maybe she wanted to someday be a fashion designer or maybe an artist leave this rathole town and eventually kim and tim disappeared into the other room tawanna and iverson talked for a little while longer and then iverson’s hands started working and then their pants were off and anyway it happened fast when it was over iverson smiled at tawanna who smiled back would she come see him play sometime would she cheer for him even when kecoughtan played bethel could he call her his little water girl iverson told moore about her the lightskinned girl from the other school moore listened as the puppy love unfolded giving iverson shit about it but no gary this was for real moore nodded and rolled his eyes but then iverson asked her to his junior prom and when he stopped at moore’s house before picking her up he was a wreck was his bow tie straight how about these shoes are they okay how was his hair and his breath and his tuxedo and no shit was moore sure these shoes worked moore put his fingers on the bow tie adjusting it he looked iverson in the eyes telling the kid that everything was working just fine this he told him was a match made in heaven ••• his boys sat behind the bench at bethel games langford and “e” and marlon following him across town when the bethel gymnasium could no longer accommodate the crowds kozlowski worked out an arrangement with hampton university which allowed the bruins to play their home games at its seat convocation center though even before games against rival hampton high there were two thousand spectators turned away because entry would cause a fire hazard “coach we’ve got a problem” a police officer said to kozlowski before a packed game shortly before tipoff ann in all her glory and iverson’s two sisters were outside raising hell because they could not get in kozlowski kicked three fans out so ann and the girls could enter and they soon took their place behind the bruins’ bench too the bethel star’s mother telling anyone within earshot that her baby was gonna get rich and buy her a red jaguar one day iverson had emerged as a fullfledged star named by the talent scout bob gibbons as the nation’s top basketball prospect sure to make his college choice among heavyweights duke or kentucky or kansas or maryland but then again he loved football too and as a quarterback and defensive back the recruiting analyst tom lemming suggested he and a new orleans quarterback named peyton manning were the top two high school players in america the town spilled into the convocation center most everyone trying to catch a glimpse of virginia’s newest favorite son moore a hampton university employee pushed his way through the crowds and tawanna came to watch her new boyfriend too – marveling then at how iverson was more than just a talented player he insisted on doing things his way iverson bickered with bailey sometimes usually if the coach tried to compel iverson to pass the ball more often “coach stop telling me how to play all the time” iverson shot toward bailey during the game against hampton high and in exchange bailey benched his star the next game iverson refused to take a shot – nothing but passes if tony rutland found him wide open near the wing iverson held the ball a moment and then passed it back if he had a clear path through the lane nope – he popped it to the outside and the bruins eventually trailed by twenty points “looking back” bailey said “probably today coaching somebody like allen i wouldn’t say ‘pass the ball’ ” in february  iverson and the bruins were about to make good on iverson’s vow to win the virginia basketball championship bailey despite his occasional frustration believed that iverson had learned from his past mistakes that the risk of him messing up his future was now mostly behind him nonetheless the coach stayed on him pushing iverson and checking in on him but now that iverson was a junior bailey saw a talented youngster not just finding his way out but pushing through so many barriers that had been placed in front of him on a thursday night the evening before a game iverson was bored like usual he did not feel like sleeping a little before midnight he asked a few friends what they were in the mood for one of them suggested they go bowling you can buy not a game the incredible rise and unthinkable fall of allen iverson on amazon books evergreen featured excerpt
