interesting trip i did regards mmm  by bluejay   am the epa limits arsenic in tap water to  parts per billion but levels of this metal may be up to  times higher in well water in some areas of the country even so an arsenic level as high as  parts per billion may not be something to get upset about arsenic has actually been approved in high dilution as a safe homeopathic remedy in the us for decades with no ill effects but if testing shows your well water contains dangerous levels of arsenic you should take measures to decontaminate it via aeration or reverse osmosis always on the side of science marc s micozzi md phd insiders cures  by cw   pm just wondered if anyone was following the horrible mistake that the epa performed in colorado when trying to clean up an old mine instead of

court scheduled a court appearance dater on february   at  am for a hearing on the settlement other people are happier about this settlement than i perhaps additional revelations will better inform the regulators in california that there are reasons why california was rated as the lowest state in the union for its regulation enforcement against business on the positive side of these matters the chicken little advocates and doomsday criers have bent their pic our governments with elected appointed and advocates must stand back and look at the positive environmental results that have occurred

permitting process and the public meeting to be held it will take place thursday february   at am the staff proposed a permit with significant reductions in testing which relates to less costly a process water is a hot topic in california last january was the driest january recorded san francisco had zero rain sacramento had  of an inch alleghany did better but not by much california and all states must meet federal water standards states may write more restrictive regulations up to a point california is one of those states you may remember that after a national review five states rated a �f� for hostilities towards business via regulations only one state got an �f� minus yes it was my home state california this is not something our governments should be proud of or gloat about i believe that changes are occurring the pendulum swung beyond reason and may be moving towards a healthier environment for our state working with the staff over the past two years is better than working with staff in   and  when the permits were reviewed i remain argumentative about two areas that seem to be in conflict we have fifteen minutes to make our sixteen to one points to the board below is my response to a new mandatory requirement called an infeasibility analysis it will be discussed on thursday february   gayleen perreira senior water resources control engineer npdes permitting sacramento office an infeasibility analysis for original sixteen to one mine inc company for underground water leaving an old adit named the  tunnel is speculative to evaluate as to complying with the revised limits for drinking water by the federal government the company spent much time and money with various suggested methods for public water districts private water systems and home owner drinking water to reduce arsenic in drinking water the results caused discoloration and the release of iron into the water site conditions contributed to these results the discharge is remote difficult to access in winter and inches above the intermittent kanaka creek during normal seasons with the assistance of the california water boards the company will continue to explore and test methods to reduce the level of natural arsenic to or below the federal level for drinking water here are four ways a introduction of additional water for dilution b pump water for irrigation c identify abnormal isolated influx of arsenic and treat underground d locate natural runoff underground at higher elevations and eliminated flow into kanaka creek it is believed that the water sources are directly the result of storm water seeping into fractures very close to the old tertiary gravel contact with bedrock this area has been inaccessible for over eighty years an exploratory expedition through old workings will be considered as a possibility to catch the water before it enters the  miles of underground levels perhaps an area of highly mineralized arsenopyrite will be found and can be isolated from surface water runoff thereby eliminating native arsenic entering surface water the company estimates that two years are required to explore the actual property in order to establish the best management practice for a reduction of arsenic the company will continue to explore the scientific or technological industries for a better solution than those known today considering the various paths to follow it is reasonable to expect a significant process that will permanently bring the company�s property in compliance within drinking water standards if required will occur before or in  michael meister miller president  by michael miller   pm from the water boards submit comments on the tentative npdes permit of public hearing for sixteen to one mine to rbsnpdescommentswaterboardscagoc  by michael miller   pm please take note to read the entries under this topic back to  at pm reply to fred anyone can comment the only questionable over limit element is arsenic your question about sorely needed water makes sense common sense unfortunately california�s regulatory situation in  is illogical outdated years ago when the environment was under attack from growth drastic changes were necessary the california legislature and executive agency leaders are too preoccupied to bring necessary environmental revisions the levels of arsenic threaten no animal life the loss of an important industry gold extraction threatens americans i just finished a phone conference with central water quality staff regarding the tentative permit they were very helpful now it is the american public�s turn to help what happens in alleghany pushes an unpopular agenda every shareholder has will be affected by these overreaching state or federal requirements i encourage your notification to others and taking the opportunity and time to move our country in a positive direction it is our choice here is what i learned about �designated parties� letters will be reviewed by an executive committee with a lawyer the request must explain the basis for status as a designated party and in particular how the person is directly affected by the discharge if you read this website and are not a shareholder you can still qualify there are always letters from environmental individuals and groups lobbying the water board to thrash productive people ranchers farmers loggers miners manufacturers i know of some who are pathetic souls objection in favor of the environment pumps a low ego facts and evidence don�t matter it is not necessary for you to attend the meeting letters from all designated parties will go to board members in advance of the meeting i hope there are hundreds the water staff has a direct email address for designated party requests which i will post as soon as i receive it i will present evidence to the board that the presumed adverse effects of the ground water are overstated it is important to point out that the property owner does not treat or impact the quality of the water flowing through its land this is an unavoidable situation we could be pear farmers growing in alleghany would the pear farmer be required to obtain a water permit and conduct numerous water analyses a logical response to water regulators is to ask why doesn�t every parking lot land owner test the water runoff and pay a permit fee perhaps it is our business mining the existence of the sixteen to one mine causes zero nuisance or harm to all beneficial users of water the law regulating waters in america were passed to protect water a vital element for life i support responsible enforcement of governmental regulations anything you can do helps overcome ignorance from otherwise smart and informed people  by fredmcain   am michael i have a couple of questions about this first of all if we do not live in california how can we help i would want to do what i can anyways the second question i have is what kind of contaminants if any are in the water in the deepest part of the mine i keep hearing and reading about this devastating drought and water shortages in the state then something occurred to me with water in short supply wouldn�t this be a good time to �dewater� the mine down to the foot level maybe that water could be sorely needed downstream as long as there are no contaminants in it unfortunately i am not a hydrologist so maybe i�m way off base here what do you think regards fred m cain  by wk   pm it sounds like the water regulators have a desk but not enough useful work to justify their pay accordingly they unwittingly overreach and make trouble to other bureaucrats this looks like they are actually working this is a widespread problem in all levels of government  by michael miller   pm help help help help �if you can find the time the notice of public hearing below has significant meaning for the sixteen to one mine and all the gold mines in the western united states before any gold mining occurred the earth formed mineral rich deposits an associate element to gold is arsenic arsenic is broadly distributed and has positive effects on life it is also a killer in heavy concentrations few of these are in inorganic mineralrich lands while i have done a great deal of research and held numerous discussions with california�s water staff about the regulations impacting our important industry their adjustment in attitudes remains marginal when it comes to a permit for operating you can help read the notice below and take special interest in the paragraph below �the designated parties for this hearing are as follows� please apply to become a designated party many businesses are closing or driven from california the world knows california has the most egregious unfriendly arbitrary unnecessary unreasonable and at times unlawful regulations in the united states the major work of preparing a permit falls on the shoulders of the water staff the heavy players in perpetuating the injustices that have occurred to the sixteen to one mine and many others both in the mining business and nonmining businesses is well documented the heavy hand of what�fear cowards bully greed stupidity jealousy ignorance disinterest laziness rests with the politicians and their appointed boards the decision regarding the classification of ground water passing through our property will be given to the california regional water quality control board central valley region in february the public must send notice of participation by november   no later than pm in writing instruction are in the public notice following this entry i offer suggestions but recommend you read this topic for background of the issues people unfamiliar with the sixteen to one should have an interest in just what is taking place in california it might be taking place in your state as well i�m not saying that the regulators are evil bad or any of the fear greed etc cited above maybe it is apathy or a lack of

district manager overview on november   mark raymond fussell miner age  was fatally injured when his head struck the lip of a protruding ore chute while he was operating a locomotive the root cause of the accident was the failure of the mine operator to install warning devices ahead of and at the chute to conspicuously mark the restricted clearance failure to properly maintain the locomotives speed controlling system was a contributing factor fussell had  years of underground mining experience he was rehired by this company in august  and had worked at the mine a total of one year and eight months he had received training in accordance with  cfr part  general information the sixteen to one mine a multilevel underground gold mine owned and operated by original sixteen to one mine inc was located one mile south of alleghany sierra county california principal operating officials were michael miller president charles brown secretary scott k robertson treasurer and jonathan farrell mine manager the mine operated one eight hour shift five days a week total employment was twenty two persons eleven of which worked underground goldbearing ore was drilled and blasted in stopes broken ore was mucked into ore chutes the ore was loaded into rail cars trammed by batteryoperated locomotives to a railmounted skip at the level station and hoisted to a storage pocket above the  level it was transported out of the mine by trains through an adit to a surface dump site the ore was separated by hand and a percentage was sold as specimen gold to various customers the remainder was processed in the mill and poured into ingots the last regular inspection of this mine was conducted on august   another inspection was conducted following the accident investigation description of the accident on the day of the accident mark fussell victim telephoned jonathan farrell mine manager and informed him that he would be late reporting to work fussell arrived at the mine between  am and  am and went to his assigned work area at the bottom of the  boll� raise located on the  level farrell met fussell at the raise a short time later and told him that vincent kautz miner would be his partner for the day farrell left the area and fussell began securing a slusher at the top of the raise at approximately  pm kautz arrived and met fussell at the bottom of the raise fussell entered the raise and took measurements for timbers which were to be installed to secure the slusher after he finished measuring he came down the raise and boarded the locomotive parked approximately three to six feet in front of the ore chute fussell planned on tramming the locomotive in reverse to a wood stockpile area for a distance of approximately  yards to obtain the needed timbers he asked kautz if he wanted to ride to the timber stockpile on the rail car which was coupled to the rear of the locomotive kautz declined and began to walk towards the stockpile fussell then engaged the locomotives controller and as he backed the locomotive his head struck the bottom corner of the chute kautz heard a noise looked back and saw fussell pinned between the locomotives battery compartment and the chute lip kautz ran to a nearby telephone called for assistance then returned to the accident site he pushed the locomotive out from under the chute and freed the unconscious victim steve sheppert hoistman arrived and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation the victim was transported to the shaft station hoisted to the  level and transported out of the mine where local emergency response personnel attended to him fussell was pronounced dead at the scene death was attributed to blunt trauma to the head investigation of the accident msha was notified of the accident on november   at  pm by a telephone call from michael miller company president to lee ratliff district manager an investigation was started on the same day an order was issued pursuant to section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners an msha accident investigation team traveled to the mine conducted an inspection of the accident site interviewed miners and reviewed appropriate training and work procedure documents the miners did not request nor have representation during the investigation discussion � the accident occurred on the  level in the haulage drift below the  boll� raise the drift measured approximately � feet wide and  feet high one set of narrow gauge railroad tracks ran the length of the drift and they were in good condition the accident site was dry and level this area had been inactive for a period of time however work had commenced on this level the month preceding the accident when it was decided to mine the stope above the  boll� raise � the locomotive involved in this accident was a mancha type b little trammer it weighed approximately  pounds with the batteries installed it was  inches high  inches wide and approximately five feet long when facing the operators controls the seat was to the right side a flatbed rail car was coupled to the locomotive at the time of the accident � the locomotive was positioned on the tracks so that the operators seat was on the same side of the drift as the ore chutes the locomotive could be turned around to face the opposite direction which would have reduced the risk of an operator striking his head on a chute � the locomotive was powered by a series wound direct current dc drive with three tramming speed contacts in both forward and reverse the contacts were initiated by a hand lever drum controller located to the right front of the operator when he was seated sideways on the machine when the lever was in the middle position none of the contacts were engaged when the lever was rotated counterclockwise the three contacts for the reverse direction were engaged one at a time beginning with the lowest to the highest speed rotating the lever in the clockwise direction engaged the contacts for forward travel � contacts for first speed in the drum controller engaged but would not move the machine in either forward or reverse when tested by msha the contacts for second and third speed engaged properly the machine could only be moved by engaging second or third speed which resulted in quicker acceleration and a jerking motion the locomotive accelerated faster in reverse than in forward the locomotive was in reverse at the time of the accident dirt and carbon buildup was observed on the contacts but did not play a role in the nonfunctional first speed after further investigation it was concluded that a resistor bank between the controller and motor was defective or open thus rendering first speed inoperable it appeared to the investigators that this defective condition had existed for a period of time and that the locomotives impact with the chute did not cause the resistor bank to fail no other safety defects were found on the machine � the locomotive was equipped with a band brake attached to the end of the motor shaft the brake was in good condition and was controlled by a handoperated lever located to the right of the operators seat the lever was connected via linkage to the brake assembly the brake was tested by msha during the investigation when stationary the locomotive would not move when the brake was set and engine power applied the brake also stopped the machine when it was applied while the machine was moving the brake had not been applied by the victim prior to the accident � the bottom of the wooden ore chute involved in the accident was  inches above the rail and extended eight inches inside the west rail almost to the center of the track this measurement meant that there was two inches of clearance between the top of the locomotive and the chute lip to safely clear this chute an operator would have to completely duck inside the operators compartment of the locomotive when the locomotive passed under it all other chutes on the  level inspected by msha during the accident investigation had similar restricted clearances but did not extend as far out into the rails as the one involved in the accident heights of these chutes above the rail were the same as the one involved in the accident � none of the chutes on the  level had markings on them to warn miners on mobile equipment of the restricted clearance hazard also there were no warning signs in advance of any of these chutes to warn of upcoming restricted clearance hazards � it was evident to the investigators that the inoperative first speed and defective resistor bank had existed for a period of time conclusion the root cause of the accident was the failure of the mine operator to install warning devices in advance of and at the ore chute to conspicuously mark the restricted clearance the operators failure to promptly correct the defective speed controlling system contributed to the accident enforcement actions original sixteen to one mine inc order no  was issued on november   under the provisions of section k of the mine act a fatal accident occurred at this operation on november   a miner was operating a battery motor when his head struck an ore chute this order is issued to assure the safety of persons at this operation until the affected area can be returned to normal operations as determined by an authorized representative of the secretary the mine operator shall obtain approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover equipment andor return affected areas of the mine to normal order no  was terminated on november   conditions that contributed to the accident no longer exist and normal mining operations can resume citation no  was issued on january   under the provisions of section a of the mine act for a violation of  cfr  a miner was fatally injured at this mine on november   while operating a mancha locomotive on the  level when his head struck a protruding ore chute causing it to become wedged between the battery compartment of the locomotive and the chute the chute extended into the drift to the midpoint of the train rails at approximately the same height as the locomotives operators head warning devices had not been installed in advance of the ore chute to indicate restricted clearance nor had the chute been conspicuously marked nor marked at all to warn and remind miners of the restricted clearance the citation was terminated when colored tape was placed to warn equipment operators of chute locations additionally the chute was modified so that locomotive operators can not contact it when operating a train citation no  was issued on january   under the provisions of section a of the mine act for a violation of  cfr  a miner was fatally injured at this mine on november   when he struck his head on an ore chute protruding into the drift at approximately head level after he engaged the speed controller of the mancha locomotive he was operating the locomotive had a clearly evident defect which had not been corrected in a timely manner to prevent a hazard to the miner alternatively the locomotive was not taken out of service and placed in a designated area posted for that purpose nor was the vehicle tagged or other effective method of marking the defective items used to prohibit further use of the vehicle until the noticeable defect was corrected this defect was easily detectable during a preoperational or other similar inspection it made continued operation hazardous to persons by causing the locomotive to be difficult to control at slow speeds or when starting from a stopped position the machines speed controller first point of power slow speed to the drive motor was not functioning as designed thus the locomotive would not move until the second point of power was contacted when it would then jump or lurch forward related fatal alert bulletin fabm appendices a persons participating in the investigation b persons interviewed appendix a persons
