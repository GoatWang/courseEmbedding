jonathon colman posted on may   following are the video slides description and transcript for my keynote talk wicked ambiguity see the acknowledgments for more information about my sources influences and the people who helped me along the way video slides description wicked ambiguity and user experience how do you solve the world’s hardest problems and how would you respond if they’re unsolvable as user experience professionals we’re focused on people who live and work in the here and now we dive into research define the problem break down silos and focus on people’s intent to create solutions but how does our ux work change when a project lasts not for one year or even  years but for  years or more enter the “wicked problem” or situations with so much ambiguity complexity and interdependencies that—by definition—they can’t be solved using realworld examples from nasa’s voyager program the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository and other longterm ux efforts we’ll talk about the challenges of creating solutions for people whom we’ll never know in our lifetimes the ways we grapple with ambiguity give us a new perspective on our work and on what it means to build experiences that last transcript introduction let us go then you and i when the evening is spread out against the sky like a patient etherized upon a table let us go through certain halfdeserted streets the muttering retreats of restless nights in onenight cheap hotels and sawdust restaurants with oystershells oh do not ask “what is it” let us go and make our visit source welcome to wicked ambiguity a journey through time and space spanning  trillion years and  quadrillion miles this talk isn’t about me or my work it’s about you and why you matter i’m dedicating this talk not to j alfred prufrock but instead to leonard nimoy while he’s best known for “star trek” you may not know that leonard was also the host of tv’s “in search of…” in which he looked for answers to longstanding mysteries of the unknown and you know what you do that too we’re all just nerds looking for answers—and leonard helped make it safe for us to be geeks to be introverts and to be fascinated by the universe that surrounds us “we’re all stories in the end” source after all so i won’t say rest in peace but rather “live long and prosper” about our journey don’t worry everything’s going to be fine i’m your host for the next hour while we boldly go through the vast reaches of time and space i’ll make sure none of us gets lost and everyone makes it back but fair warning the people who return won’t be the same as the ones who leave got somewhere else to be no worries you can get these slides now at bitlyraycats—don’t worry i promise that’ll make more sense by the end note you need to use all lowercase letters or the link won’t work let’s start with a memory most things in the past do do you remember being a child and your parents telling you “don’t worry everything’s going to be fine” source but you really thought they were lying just to make you feel better because it was dark you were scared and you didn’t know what to expect kind of like in this keynote well then “don’t worry everything’s going to be fine” it’s a story we tell to project confidence and security but it’s a hard promise to make we can’t even predict the location and movements of a single atom—let alone complex things like world events the stock market or whether it’ll be nice out on thursday so maybe just maybe everything’s not going to be fine what then this symbol is taken from one of the pioneer satellites launched by nasa in the ‘s it was also used on voyager the furthest manmade object from the earth spinning from out of the blue and into the black today we’ll talk about this symbol and what it means we’ll also cover a lot of science and math but almost no science fiction—even though the ideas we’re discussing are fantastical but other than quotes from books and tv shows like “doctor who” everything you’re about to see is real it’s true and it’s troubling some of you will leave today saying “this talk has nothing to do with user experience” others will say “this talk has everything to do with user experience” guess what you’re both right continue reading → posted in life work  tagged ambiguity conferences doctor who keynote public speaking raycats science user

tubridybrain traffic used with permission this post is nearly two years too late i should have written it back in  after i attended confab central in minneapolis for the first time the conference had already been around for a few years and i thought that i was late to the game i was worried that i’d come across like a real nb out of my league and behind in the conversation but it wasn’t like that at all there were so many smart people there good people the kind of people where the conversation just keeps on flowing on its own i learned so much hugged so many folks laughed so hard i spilled my coffee again my apologies to the hyatt regency they were so open so welcoming—it almost felt like coming home but now it’s  i’ll be giving the opening keynote at confab central this year so this post is late—i should have written it back in  because now you won’t believe me when i tell you about confab you’ll say i’m biased so let me be clear about this when it comes to confab i am biased extremely biased biased like your aunt suzy but i’m not biased because they’re paying me—i can’t accept any payment for speaking so instead we’re making a donation to girls who code a great nonprofit with a mission i believe in rather i’m biased because the experience of attending confab is just so amazing and i want to share that bias with you openly in plain sight so that you can experience the

february    jennifer tomaloff cc byncsa  crosspublished on medium in —when they told us that the soviets boycotting the olympics in los angeles wasn’t such a big deal really—marvel comics published secret wars it was such an amazing comic book series… nothing like it had ever been done before heroes and villains from dozens of separate titles all duking it out together over the course of a year to my hungry nineyearold eyes it was hard to tell who the heroes were because sometimes they turned out to be the villains and some of the villains were really just misunderstood heroes to me it was the very peak of drama every panel was like a movie each issue an epic what i didn’t understand at the time was the series’ political parallels ronald reagan was running a secret war of his own quietly selling arms to iran to fund rebel forces in nicaragua so i devoured each issue like an addict flipping the pages at a staccato pace and my addiction spread quickly—secret wars made me a comics fan for over a decade and as i grew up it lead me to bigger and better stories stories like these three which are about the real secret wars they’re the dark battles that remain unspoken lurking on the fringes and hiding in plain sight they’re the conspiracies of silence caused by the things we can’t say those are wars too we wage them with the people closest to us but never admit to their existence… or to the damage they cause the things that hurt us the most are the ones we can’t speak of they pull at us in the smallest the most intimate of ways they break us with their banality or sometimes they just break us here are three stories from the front continue reading → posted in life  tagged addiction comics death depression drugs family politics   comments how to get one million views on slideshare by jonathon colman posted on may   one million views on slideshare… and countingimage  slideshare on the week of january   i cracked the one million views mark for my presentations on slideshare i’m now well on the road to two million i’m definitely not the first or the only one to reach this point many presentations have hundreds of thousands of views – a few even have millions and since several publishers on slideshare are quite prolific there must be numerous accounts who have reached – and far surpassed – this sum even so i did a happy dance can you blame me i was an early adopter of slideshare my first upload dates back to july   that’s nearly seven years’ worth of use i started using slideshare less than a year after posting my first tweet and first status update on facebook you might be aware that there are benefits to being an early adopter of a nascent network even so if you’ve ever seen me speak then you know that a favorite topic of mine is my own nonexceptionalism i can’t think of anything i’ve done that anyone else couldn’t do or do better so i believe that with the right methods and approach just about anyone can reach one million views on slideshare my goal is to help you do that do great work that’s worthy of being shared out of all of my presentations the above talk on core values is my favorite it took me seven years of practice to create something of this level of quality it may not be a big accomplishment to you that’s okay – it was to me and hopefully i can do much better work in the future while it should go without saying that we have to challenge ourselves to do the best we can how would you explain why there are so many bad presentations being given so often to understand we have to start from a position of empathy i think that the majority of bad talks aren’t given on purpose most of the time i think that speakers are in a rush or haven’t prepared well or are nervous or are distracted or don’t understand how to design slides or don’t want to speak in the first place or feel intimidated or aren’t held accountable to give a good performance or any number of other factors and challenges i certainly know what all that feels like i’ve given bad talks under circumstances just like these the good news is that all of these problems can be solved all of these weaknesses can be improved upon don’t believe me take a look at my first few presentations i leave them online in my slideshare account to remind me of how i started out – with no natural talent design sense or storytelling ability my recent talks look much better and have far more views and shares the rest of this post explains is an introduction to how i made that happen continue reading → posted in work  tagged

yourselfphoto  johngineer once again it’s time to write your annual selfreview just like last year and the year before review season sneaked up on you when you weren’t looking now you’ve landed on this page after raiding google for tips and tricks hoping to find some secret key or formula that will help you ace your written selfevaluation so that you can get back to… well whatever it is you’re doing instead of preparing for your review no such luck there’s no hidden back door no algorithm to fool no “one weird trick” to get around evaluating yourself and your actions if you were successful in your work this year you’ll need to weigh the merits of touting that success versus coming off like a braggart but if you failed to meet your goals then you’ll need to decide how to handle being accountable for your actions or whether you’ll blame circumstances your colleagues or that old favorite “the system” sound familiar it’s a painful scenario experienced by workers all around the world but reviews shouldn’t be so binary and they shouldn’t be dreaded either accountability has somehow become a dirty word in our lexicon… a tool that’s wielded like a cudgel when it should instead be seen as being more like a warm blanket because reviews can be hacked just like any other system or process hating on reviews only displays a lack of imagination and you’re better than that — i know it

giving by jonathon colman posted on december   ed note this post was anonymously written as part of blog secret santa and i’m extremely grateful to the author for creating such a thoughtful post there’s a list of all secret santa posts including one written by me on santa’s list of  gift posts on givingphoto  shereen m on giving i can still remember the first time i read the gift of the magi reading it today is one of my favorite holiday traditions my mother had brought home a special edition of the story book complete with a red velveteen slipcase and the title embossed in beautiful script letters on the cover it sat on our coffee table for all of five minutes before i gave in to the allure of its goldgilded pages i recall feeling the lump in my throat as i read about the main characters a couple of modest means jim and della who sold their most prized possessions only to unknowingly buy each other gifts that they would both no longer be able to use in the end it didn’t matter in the end the act of giving the gifts was greater than the gifts themselves real life works this way too just like the many others who’ve read the tale before me since it was first published over a hundred years ago i was deeply moved i may have even got a bit mistyeyed but look beyond the cosmic irony of magi’s mechanics and you’ll see actions universally held as noble and good actions like thoughtful consideration for another person’s needs and desires and sacrifice for the sake of someone else stories like these resonate with something deep inside us because we all want to give and receive that sort of gift continue reading → posted in guest post  tagged blog secret santa christmas content strategy empathy gifts holidays  leave a comment i’m joining the content strategy team

mention in the huffington post i wrote a handful of blog posts including this handcurated list of  content strategy resources i also guestblogged i mentored i did informal pro bono consulting and qas with a number of organizations… but mostly i met people and i listened soaking up information and perspectives and new ideas throughout all of that i also worked a fulltime job at rei as their

and against all our rational instincts we love information but my point — and i do have one — is that information endures yes even information on twitter as ephemeral as it may seem we can still tell

on march   welcome to confab central the content strategy conference in minneapolis minnesota  sean tubridybrain traffic used with permission this post is nearly two years too late i should have written it back in  after i attended confab central in minneapolis for the first time the conference had already been around for a few years and i thought that i was late to the game i was worried that i’d come across like a real nb out of my league and behind in the conversation but it wasn’t like that at all there were so many smart people there good people the kind of people where the conversation just keeps on flowing on its own i learned so much hugged so many folks laughed so hard i spilled my coffee again my apologies to the hyatt regency they were so open so welcoming—it almost felt like coming home but now it’s  i’ll be giving the opening keynote at confab central this year so this post is late—i should have written it back in  because now you won’t believe me when i tell you about confab you’ll say i’m biased so let me be clear about this when it comes to confab i am biased extremely biased biased like your aunt suzy but i’m not biased because they’re paying me—i can’t accept any payment for speaking so instead we’re making a donation to girls who code a great nonprofit with a mission i believe in rather i’m biased because the experience of attending confab is just so amazing and i want to share that bias with you openly in plain sight so that you can experience the same things i have here’s why you should join me at confab central this year continue

that the soviets boycotting the olympics in los angeles wasn’t such a big deal really—marvel comics published secret wars it was such an amazing comic book series… nothing like it had ever been done before heroes and villains from dozens of separate titles all duking it out together over the course of a year to my hungry nineyearold eyes it was hard to tell who the heroes were because sometimes they turned out to be the villains and some of the villains were really just misunderstood heroes to me it was the very peak of drama every panel was like a movie each issue an epic what i didn’t understand at the time was the series’ political parallels ronald reagan was running a secret war of his own quietly selling arms to iran to fund rebel forces in nicaragua so i devoured each issue like an addict flipping the pages at a staccato pace and my addiction spread quickly—secret wars made me a comics fan for over a decade and as i grew up it lead me to bigger and better stories stories like these three which are about the real secret wars they’re the dark battles that remain unspoken lurking on the fringes and hiding in plain sight they’re the conspiracies of silence caused by the things we can’t say those are wars too we wage them with the people closest to us but never admit to their existence… or to the damage they cause the things that hurt us the most are the ones we can’t speak of they pull at us in the smallest the most intimate of ways they break us with their banality or sometimes they just break us here are three stories from the front continue reading → posted in

countingimage  slideshare on the week of january   i cracked the one million views mark for my presentations on slideshare i’m now well on the road to two million i’m definitely not the first or the only one to reach this point many presentations have hundreds of thousands of views – a few even have millions and since several publishers on slideshare are quite prolific there must be numerous accounts who have reached – and far surpassed – this sum even so i did a happy dance can you blame me i was an early adopter of slideshare my first upload dates back to july   that’s nearly seven years’ worth of use i started using slideshare less than a year after posting my first tweet and first status update on facebook you might be aware that there are benefits to being an early adopter of a nascent network even so if you’ve ever seen me speak then you know that a favorite topic of mine is my own nonexceptionalism i can’t think of anything i’ve done that anyone else couldn’t do or do better so i believe that with the right methods and approach just about anyone can reach one million views on slideshare my goal is to help you do that do great work that’s worthy of being shared out of all of my presentations the above talk on core values is my favorite it took me seven years of practice to create something of this level of quality it may not be a big accomplishment to you that’s okay – it was to me and hopefully i can do much better work in the future while it should go without saying that we have to challenge ourselves to do the best we can how would you explain why there are so many bad presentations being given so often to understand we have to start from a position of empathy i think that the majority of bad talks aren’t given on purpose most of the time i think that speakers are in a rush or haven’t prepared well or are nervous or are distracted or don’t understand how to design slides or don’t want to speak in the first place or feel intimidated or aren’t held accountable to give a good performance or any number of other factors and challenges i certainly know what all that feels like i’ve given bad talks under circumstances just like these the good news is that all of these problems can be solved all of these weaknesses can be improved upon don’t believe me take a look at my first few presentations i leave them online in my slideshare account to remind me of how i started out – with no natural talent design sense or storytelling ability my recent talks look much better and have far more views and shares the rest of this post explains is an introduction to how i made that happen continue reading → posted in work  tagged community conferences content marketing inbound marketing presentations public speaking slideshare   comments how to hack your selfreview by jonathon colman posted on january   hack your review hack yourselfphoto  johngineer once again it’s time to write your annual selfreview just like last year and the year before review season sneaked up on you when you weren’t looking now you’ve landed on this page after raiding google for tips and tricks hoping to find some secret key or formula that will help you ace your written selfevaluation so that you can get back to… well whatever it is you’re doing instead of preparing for your review no such luck there’s no hidden back door no algorithm to fool no “one weird trick” to get around evaluating yourself and your actions if you were successful in your work this year you’ll need to weigh the merits of touting that success versus coming off like a braggart but if you failed to meet your goals then you’ll need to decide how to handle being accountable for your actions or whether you’ll blame circumstances your colleagues or that old favorite “the system” sound familiar it’s a painful scenario experienced by workers all around the world but reviews shouldn’t be so binary and they shouldn’t be dreaded either accountability has somehow become a dirty word in our lexicon… a tool that’s wielded like a cudgel when it should instead be seen as being more like a warm blanket because reviews can be hacked just like any other system or process hating on reviews only displays a lack of imagination and you’re better than that — i know it continue reading → posted in work  tagged annual evaluation annual review content content strategy evaluation hacking

and i’m extremely grateful to the author for creating such a thoughtful post there’s a list of all secret santa posts including one written by me on santa’s list of  gift posts on givingphoto  shereen m on giving i can still remember the first time i read the gift of the magi reading it today is one of my favorite holiday traditions my mother had brought home a special edition of the story book complete with a red velveteen slipcase and the title embossed in beautiful script letters on the cover it sat on our coffee table for all of five minutes before i gave in to the allure of its goldgilded pages i recall feeling the lump in my throat as i read about the main characters a couple of modest means jim and della who sold their most prized possessions only to unknowingly buy each other gifts that they would both no longer be able to use in the end it didn’t matter in the end the act of giving the gifts was greater than the gifts themselves real life works this way too just like the many others who’ve read the tale before me since it was first published over a hundred years ago i was deeply moved i may have even got a bit mistyeyed but look beyond the cosmic irony of magi’s mechanics and you’ll see actions universally held as noble and good actions like thoughtful consideration for another person’s needs and desires and sacrifice for the sake of someone else stories like these resonate with something deep inside us because we all want to give and receive that sort of gift continue reading → posted in guest post  tagged blog secret santa christmas content

ed note each year the uw information school where i’m a grad student holds its annual dean’s club dinner to thank its donors and board members for their gifts and service this year i’m emceeing the event along with fellow ischool students amanda jasso mlis  and amado robancho informatics  hcde  as part of my duties i was asked to speak about my life what brought me to the ischool and how i hoped to use information to bring value to people it turned out to be a bit wonky keep in mind that i wrote this for information scientists but it’s also part standup comedy part nostalgia for s tech and part dreaming about the future i’m grateful to the ischool for asking me to share my story introduction uw ischool dean’s club dinnerphoto  uw ischool hello i’m jonathon colman a graduate student in the msim midcareer program when i’m not at the ischool you can find me at rei headquarters down in kent where i serve as their principal experience architect and when i’m not in kent you can find me stuck in traffic on i because i’m trying to get back up to the ischool now for those of you on twitter i’m jcolman i mention this because i’m sending out prescheduled tweets during the evening with

thing now prescheduled tweets they’re perfect for that awkward moment when you just can’t seem to find the time necessary to write  characters about what you’re having for dinner… but still need everyone to know that you’re eating something …against all odds all sense of scope and against all our rational instincts we love information but my point — and i do have one — is that information
