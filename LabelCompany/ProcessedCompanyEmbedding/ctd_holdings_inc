treatment of disease today corrects false and misleading statements published on april  in the online open access journal plos one patients struggling with niemannpick disease type c npc deserve accurate and complete information about drug products used in clinical trials said n scott fine company chairman and ceo the plos one journal does a disservice to the patient community and their caregivers as well as to all the stakeholders whose investments have brought our company into two clinical trials the article states that ctds hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin trappsol® cyclo™ used in its clinical programs has different chemical and biophysical properties than another hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin also used in clinical programs the article implies superiority of one version over another ctd holdings did not provide its clinical trappsol® cyclo™ material to any of the authors of the plos article nor to their laboratories to make such a comparison possible the results in the plos article thus appear to be based on a different product than clincal trappsol® cyclo™ material if so the results are false and misleading ctd holdings has also alerted the fda about this second instance of false and misleading information about our product as propagated by another public company we will continue to ensure that information about trappsol® cyclo™ in the public domain is accurate we owe it to the families and physicians with whom we work so closely in our compassionate use program and in our clinical trials to do so said mr fine about ctd holdings ctd holdings inc is

presentation overview ctd holdings inc was organized as a florida corporation on august   with operations beginning in july  in conjunction with a restructuring in  we changed our name from cyclodextrin technologies development inc or ctdi to ctd holdings inc ctdi was then incorporated as a florida corporation and became a wholly owned subsidiary of ctd holdings inc  we are a family of biotechnology growth companies focused on the use of cyclodextrins in drug development the fda recently accepted the type ii drug master file for our lead drug candidate trappsol ® cyclo™ for filing the company anticipates launching a clinical trial program initially in europe for its trappsol® cyclo™ in  as treatment for neimanpick type c disease npc we also sell cyclodextrins and related products to the pharmaceutical nutritional and other industries primarily for use in diagnostics and specialty drugs with continuing growth in research and new product development  in  we began providing pulse spray drying services to produce raw materials used primarily in industrial and consumer products   if you have any questions about cyclodextrins or our company feel free to email us or contact dr jeffrey tate at  mission  vision mission the mission of ctd holdings inc is to develop manufacture and distribute cyclodextrinbased high value products our products treat disease improve quality of life and provide solutions in a broad range of applications including pharmaceutical formulation medical diagnostics cosmetics nutraceuticals and nutrition vision ctd holdings inc provides the world’s widest range of cyclodextrinbased fine chemicals available from a single source through its sphingo biotechnology division it develops biopharmaceuticals using cyclodextrins as the active ingredient the nanosonic products division provides industrial quantities of cyclodextrins for high value biotechnology manufacturing applications the ctd division provides research quantities of cyclodextrins to biotechnology laboratories worldwide business strategy substantially all of our revenues are derived from the sales of cyclodextrins biopharmaceuticals containing cyclodextrins cyclodextrin complexes resale of cyclodextrins manufactured by others for our clients to their specifications and our own licensed cyclodextrin products  we currently sell our products directly to customers in the diagnostics pharmaceutical and industrial chemical industries and to chemical supply distributors  in  we began offering pulse drying services our core business has transitioned to a biotech drug development company from a business which had been primarily reselling basic cyclodextrin products which have the least valueadded attributes  our strategy going forward is to pursue opportunities in healthcare where cyclodextrin applications have maximum value we market and sell biopharmaceuticals containing cyclodextrins and cyclodextrins and related products to the pharmaceutical and other industries   our revenues are principally from the sales of chemically modified cyclodextrins  for the year ended december   our revenues consisted of  biopharmaceuticals  basic natural and chemically modified cyclodextrins and  cyclodextrin complexes represented our business strategy is to increase sales by transitioning to the more valueadded biopharmaceuticals and complexes and maintaining profitability for these products our cyclodextrin sales historically involve small quantities ie less than   kg  we sell directly to our customers package the orders at our facility and ship using common carriers   the majority of our revenues are from five to ten customers who have historically been repeat purchasers   in  one customer uno healthcare inc accounted for more than  of our total revenue in  two customers uno healthcare inc and sigmaaldrich fine chemical inc accounted for more than  each of our total revenue and collectively for  of our total revenue  sigmaaldrich fine chemical inc accounts for almost  of our annual sales of aquaplex® in a year we typically sell to fewer than  individual customers we anticipate our customer trend to be moving to longterm or sole source contracts with our customers  in  we signed a fouryear supplier agreement for  trappsol® hpb with siemens corporation   our customers buy products from us as needed primarily for product research and development purposes  therefore it is difficult to predict future sales as it is dependent on the current cyclodextrin related research and development activities of others which we have monitored in the past by following  the issuance and applications of patents in the us and elsewhere we have identified pulse drying as a technology that promises benefits for turning commercial quantities of aqueous liquid solutions of trappsol® cyclodextrins and active pharmaceutical ingredients and other ingredients into a powdered solid pulse drying does this more economically and with less degradation to the materials than the traditional drying processes the cyclodextrin and active ingredient come out in a complexed powder form that can be readily used by our customers to mix into their specific product formulations in  we completed construction of a cgmp current good manufacturing practice facility and installed a pulse drying system to manufacture commercial quantities of cyclodextrin complexes  these products will meet current food and active pharmaceutical ingredient “api” production standards and will be sold using our trappsol® and aquaplex® product marks  api production quality standards are higher than those for foods but somewhat less stringent than those for finished pharmaceutical dosage manufacturers we expect to expand and diversify our product offerings  we expect over time this will result in less volatility in our sales due to lower dependence on our cyclical research and development customers         share

                                                                                                   what are cyclodextrins cyclodextrins are donut shaped circles of glucose sugar molecules that bring together oil and water and have potential applications anywhere oil and water must be used together successful applications have been made in the areas of agriculture analytical chemistry biotechnology cosmetics diagnostics electronics foodstuffs pharmaceuticals and toxic waste treatment stabilization of food flavors and fragrances is the largest current worldwide market for cyclodextrin applications we and others have developed cyclodextrinbased applications in stabilization of flavors for food products elimination of undesirable tastes and odors preparation of antifungal complexes for foods and toiletries stabilization of fragrances and dyes reduction of foaming in foods cosmetics and toiletries and the improvement of quality stability and storability of foods cyclodextrins can improve the solubility and stability of a wide range of drugs many promising drug compounds are unusable or have serious side effects because they are either too unstable or too insoluble in water strategies for administering currently approved compounds involve injection of formulations requiring ph adjustment andor the use of organic solvents the result is frequently painful irritating or damaging to the patient these side effects can be ameliorated by cyclodextrins cyclodextrins also have many potential uses in drug delivery for topical applications to the eyes and skin cyclodextrin background cyclodextrins are formed naturally by the action of bacterial enzymes on starch they were first noticed and isolated in  by a french scientist villiers as he studied rotting potatoes the bacterial enzyme naturally creates a mixture of at least three different cyclodextrins depending on how many glucose units are included in the molecular circle six glucose units yield alpha cyclodextrin “acd” seven units beta cyclodextrin “bcd” eight units gamma cyclodextrin “gcd” the more glucose units in the molecular circle the greater the volume of the toroid the inside of this “donut” provides an excellent resting place for “oily” molecules while the outside of the donut is significantly compatible with water enabling clear stable solutions of cyclodextrins to exist in aqueous environments even when an “oily” molecule is carried within the donut hole the net result is a molecular carrier that comes in small medium and large sizes with the ability to transport and deliver “oily” materials using water as the primary vehicle cyclodextrins are manufactured in large quantities by mixing appropriate enzymes with starch solutions thereby reproducing the natural process acd bcd and gcd can be manufactured by an entirely natural process and therefore are considered to be natural products additional processing is required to isolate and separate the cyclodextrins the purified acd bcd and gcd are referred to collectively as “natural” cyclodextrins ncds the chemical groups on each glucose unit in a cyclodextrin molecule provide chemists with ways to modify the properties of the cyclodextrins ie to make them more water soluble or less water soluble thereby making them better carriers for a specific chemical the cyclodextrins that result from chemical modifications are no longer considered “natural” and are referred to as chemically modified cyclodextrins since the property modifications achieved are often so advantageous to a specific application the company does not believe the loss of the “natural” product categorization will prevent its ultimate commercial use it does however create a greater regulatory burden applications one of the premises that ctd based its future success on was the endless literally applications available to cyclodextrins wherever water and water insoluble or immiscible materials need to be brought together one of the cyclodextrins is likely to make it possible andor more efficiently accomplished the following table will give you an idea of the variety of the applications possible table

to grow a recent study by qy research cyclodextrin research center cites global demand as having almost doubled between  and  from  metric tons to  metric tons  within the last  years many more european countries have approved the use of cyclodextrins in food products in the united states major starch companies are renewing their earlier interest in cyclodextrins as food and nutraceutical additives we believe the food additive industry worldwide will continue to increase its use of cyclodextrins   natural cyclodextrins have been confirmed to be generally recognized as safe gras in most of the world now including the us moreover approvals of products containing cyclodextrins by the us food and drug administration fda since  suggest that regulatory approval for new products may be easier in the future in  janssen pharmaceutica now a subsidiary of johnson  johnson received fda approval to market sporanox® an antifungal which contained hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin as an excipient in  one of our clients used our product trappsol® hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin in an fda approved compassionate use investigational new drug protocol for the treatment of niemannpick type c disease we now sell this product under our trademark trappsol® cyclo™  our customer successfully applied to the fda to designate trappsol® cyclo™ as an orphan drug in the treatment of niemann pick type c disease in support of an investigational new drug protocol  under the orphan drug act companies that develop a drug for a disorder affecting fewer than  people in the united states may seek designation as an orphan drug and if such application is approved they have the ability to sell it exclusively for seven years and may get clinical trial tax incentives  on may   the fda designated trappsol® cyclo™ as an orphan drug for the treatment of niemannpick type c disease   applications of cyclodextrins in personal products and for industrial uses have appeared in many patents and patent applications cyclodextrins are used in numerous brandname household goods including fabric softeners and air fresheners with increased manufacturing capacity and supply the prices of the natural cyclodextrins have decreased to the point that use of these materials is considered in even the most price sensitive goods we believe this will result in increasing demand for commercial uses of cyclodextrins   in japan at least twelve pharmaceutical preparations are now marketed which contain cyclodextrins there are also multiple products in europe and the united states  the cyclodextrins permit the use of all routes of administration ease of delivery and improved bioavailability of such wellknown drugs as nitroglycerin dexamethasone pge and cephalosporin permit these “old” drugs to command new market share and sometimes new patent lives because of the value added it is management’s opinion that the dollar value of the worldwide market for products containing cyclodextrins and for complexes of cyclodextrins can be a hundred times that of the market sales of the cyclodextrin itself this value increment portends opportunities for company growth in the pharmaceutical grade cyclodextrins and in custom cyclodextrin complexes trappsol® cyclo™   trappsol® cyclo™ is a parenteral grade of hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin available in either a powdered or sterile liquid presentation it has been designated an orphan drug by both the us fda and the european ema trappsol® cyclo™ is being developed in the sphingo biotechnology division for the treatment of niemann pick type c disease a rare and fatal illness tied to an autosomal recessive genetic defect trappsol® trappsol® is the trade name given to the cyclodextrins ctd inc provides to its customers the trappsol® name assures you the cyclodextrin you purchase is of the finest possible quality the letter designations after the trappsol® t name indicate the actual cyclodextrin cyclodextrin eg b is for beta β thpg stands for trappsol® hydroxypropyl gamma whenever possible the catalog number will correspond to the cyclodextrins name trappsol® products are organized by commercial category of cyclodextrin alpha α beta β and gamma γ while all of ctds products are of fine chemical quality ctd is also pleased to provide materials suitable for exacting chromatographic procedures that are listed as capillary electrophoresis grade material therefore the same catalog number may have two pricing levels referred to as fcgrade and cegrade the chemical entity is the same but the isomeric purity andor the level of impurities will be different for the cegrade which is reflected in the higher pricing within the fine chemical category ctd is also pleased to be able to provide different grades of material such as pharmaceutical technical food etc these grade designations are primarily intended for cyclodextrins that are produced in bulk the grade classification for these materials results from the manufacturing standards met by the manufacturer in terms of testing the bulk product before it is released the different industries pharmaceutical food packaging adhesives etc often require different kinds of testing hence the grade designation is more an indication of the testing that has been done rather than differences in physical or chemical properties caution the trappsol® and aquaplex® products described on this site are intended for research and investigational uses only they are not for human veterinary or household use since the pharmacological properties of the compounds described in this brochure are incompletely characterized due care should be exercised in their use material safety data sheets and certificates of analysis are available upon request aquaplex® ctd offers a line of chemicals already complexed with trappsol® cyclodextrins they are categorized as drugs flavors and miscellaneous chemicals their catalog numbers begin with ap to designate that they are aquaplex complexes the ap is followed by a four or five letter abbreviation of the active ingredient ending with a number designating the type of trappsol® cyclodextrin used in
