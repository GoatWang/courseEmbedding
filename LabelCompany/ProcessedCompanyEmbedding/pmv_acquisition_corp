   nasdaq continued listing fees    other miscellaneous expenses including franchise taxes do insurance and reserves for liquidation expenses    total      includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business combination  a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a loan from our sponsor described below these amounts will be repaid upon completion of this offering  the underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions on a certain portion of the gross proceeds of this offering upon completion of our initial business combination  which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital the underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses the amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account based on the current interest rate environment we would expect approximately  to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over  months following the closing of this offering however we can provide no assurances regarding this amount this estimate assumes an interest rate of  per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested the rules of the nasdaq capital market provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units and private placement warrants  or approximately  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full including  of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or working capital expenses until the earlier of i the completion of our initial business combination or ii the redemption of  of our public shares and private shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to the requirements of law based on current interest rates we do not expect that interest earned on the funds in the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial portion of working capital expenses the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us on or prior to the date of this prospectus we will enter into an administrative services agreement pursuant to which we will pay cibl a total of  per month for office space utilities and secretarial support however pursuant to the terms of such agreement we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust account to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with an initial business combination any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and either be due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of an initial business combination or at cibl’s option treated as working capital loans and be convertible into additional warrants on terms identical to the private placement warrants if we do not consummate an initial business combination any accrued amounts would be forgiven upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees as of march   our sponsor has loaned us  pursuant to a promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering this loan is noninterest bearing unsecured and is due at the earlier of august   the closing of this offering or the date we determine not to proceed with the offering this loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our completion of an initial business combination and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein or ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however the holder of the private shares would be entitled to exercise redemption rights and share in any liquidating distributions we make with respect to such private shares additionally if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check

with one or more businesses or entities which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we have not identified any business combination target and we have not nor has
