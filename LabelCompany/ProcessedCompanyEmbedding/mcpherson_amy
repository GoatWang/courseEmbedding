aimee semple  while attending a revival meeting in december  aimee met robert james semple a pentecostal missionary from ireland there her faith crisis ended as she decided to dedicate her life to god and made the conversion to pentecostalism as she witnessed the holy spirit moving powerfully marriage and familyedit at that same revival meeting aimee became enraptured not only by the message that robert semple gave but also with robert himself she decided to dedicate her life to both god and robert and after a short courtship they were married on august   in a salvation army ceremony pledging never to allow their marriage to lessen their devotion to god affection for comrades or faithfulness in the army the pairs notion of army was very broad encompassing much more than just the salvation

she met harold stewart mcpherson an accountant they were married on may   moved to providence rhode island and had a son rolf potter kennedy mcpherson in march  during this time mcpherson felt as though she denied her calling to go preach after struggling with emotional distress and obsessive–compulsive disorder she would fall to weep and pray she felt the call to preach tug at her even more strongly after the birth of rolf then in  she fell seriously ill and mcpherson states she again heard the persistent voice asking her to go preach while in the holding room after a failed operation mcpherson accepted the voices challenge and she suddenly opened her eyes and was able to turn over in bed without pain one spring morning in  her husband returned home from the night shift to discover mcpherson had left him and taken the children a few weeks later a note was received inviting him to join her in evangelistic work aimee semple mcpherson and her third husband david l hutton enjoying their honeymoon breakfast to avoid news publicity they chartered a plane to yuma arizona and were married in a small ceremony hutton assisted in some of mcphersons charity work before their divorce in  her husband later followed mcpherson to take her back home when he saw her though preaching to a crowd he witnessed her transformation into a radiant lovely woman before long he became her fellow worker in christ their house in providence was sold and he joined her in setting up tents for revival meetings and even did some preaching himself throughout their journey food and accommodations were uncertain as they lived out of the gospel car her husband in spite of initial enthusiasm wanted a life that was more stable and predictable eventually he returned to rhode island and around  filed for separation he petitioned for divorce citing abandonment the divorce was granted in  she married again on september   to actor and musician david hutton followed by much drama after which she fainted and fractured her skull while mcpherson was away in europe to recover she was angered to learn hutton was billing himself as aimees man in his cabaret singing act and was frequently photographed with scantily clad women huttons muchpublicized personal scandals were damaging the foursquare gospel church and their leaders credibility with other churches mcpherson and hutton separated in  and divorced on march   mcpherson later publicly repented of the marriage as wrong from the beginning for both theological and personal reasons and therefore rejected nationally known gospel singer homer rodeheaver a more appropriate suitor when he eventually asked for her hand in  early careeredit while married to robert semple the two moved to chicago and became part of william durhams full gospel assembly there aimee was discovered to have a unique ability in the interpretation of speaking in tongues translating with stylistic eloquence the otherwise indecipherable utterances of glossolalia unable to find fulfillment as a housewife in  mcpherson began evangelizing and holding tent revivals across the sawdust trail in the united states and canada after her first successful visits she had little difficulty with acceptance or attendance eager converts filled the pews of local churches which turned many recalcitrant ministers into her enthusiastic supporters frequently she would start a revival meeting in a hall or church and then have to move to a larger building to accommodate the growing crowds when no buildings were suitable she set up a tent which was often filled past capacity she wanted to create the enthusiasm a pentecostal meeting could provide with its amen corner and halleluiah chorus but also to avoid its unbridled chaos as participants started shouting trembling on the floor and speaking in tongues all at once mcpherson organized her meetings with the general public in mind and yet did not wish to quench any who suddenly came into the spirit to this she set up a tarry tent or room away from the general area for any who suddenly started speaking in tongues or display any other holy ghost behavior by which the larger audience might be put off in  mcpherson embarked on a tour of the southern united states in her gospel car and again later in  with her mother mildred kennedy mildred was an important addition to mcphersons ministry and managed everything including the money which gave them an unprecedented degree of financial security their vehicle was a  packard touring car emblazoned with religious slogans standing on the back seat of the convertible mcpherson preached sermons over a megaphone on the road between sermons she would sit in the back seat typing sermons and other religious materials she first traveled up and down the eastern united states then went to other parts of the country by  she had started her own magazine the bridal call for which she wrote many articles about women’s roles in religion she portrayed the link between christians and jesus as a marriage bond along with taking seriously the religious role of women the magazine contributed to transforming pentecostalism from a movement into an ongoing american religious presence  while mcpherson was traveling for her evangelical work she arrived in baltimore where she was first discovered by the newspapers in  after a day of conducting evangelistic services at the lyric opera house baltimore became one of the pivotal points for her early career the crowds in their religious ecstasy were barely kept under control as they gave way to manifestations of the spirit moreover her alleged faith healings now became part of the public record and attendees began to focus on that part of her ministry over all else mcpherson also considered the baltimore revival an important turning point not only for her ministry but in the history of the outpouring of the pentecostal power  career in los angelesedit in late  mcpherson came to los angeles a move many at the time were making for better opportunities minnie kennedy her mother rented the largest hall they could find the seat philharmonic auditorium known then as temple auditorium people waited for hours to get in and mcpherson could hardly reach the pulpit without stepping on someone afterwards grateful attendees of her los angeles meetings built a home for her family and her which included everything from the cellar to a canary bird at this time los angeles had become a popular vacation spot rather than touring the united states to preach her sermons mcpherson stayed in los angeles drawing audiences from a population which had soared from  in  to  people in  and often included many visitors wearied by constant traveling and having nowhere to raise a family mcpherson had settled in los angeles where she maintained both a home and a church mcpherson believed that by creating a church in los angeles her audience would come to her from all over the country this she felt would allow her to plant seeds of the gospel and tourists would take it home to their communities still reaching the masses for several years she continued to travel and raise money for the construction of a large domed church building at  glendale blvd in the echo park area of los angeles the church would be named angelus temple reflecting the roman catholic tradition of the angelus bell calling the faithful to prayer as well its reference to the angels not wanting to take on debt mcpherson located a construction firm which would work with her as funds were raised by faith she started with  the firm indicated it would be enough to carve out a hole for the foundation mcpherson began a campaign in earnest and was able to mobilize diverse groups of people to help fund and build the new church various fundraising methods were used such as selling chairs for temple seating at us  apiece in exchange chairholders got a miniature chair and encouragement to pray daily for the person who would eventually sit in that chair her approach worked to generate enthusiastic giving and to create a sense of ownership and family among the contributors raising more money than she had hoped mcpherson altered the original plans and built a megachurch that would draw many followers throughout the years the endeavor cost contributors around  in actual money spent however this price was low for a structure of its size costs were kept down by donations of building materials and volunteer labor mcpherson sometimes quipped when she first got to california all she had was a car ten dollars and a tambourine enrollment grew exceeding  and was advertised to be the largest single christian congregation in the world according to church records angelus temple received  million visitors within the first seven years mcpherson intended the angelus temple as both a place of worship and an ecumenical center for persons of all christian faiths to meet and build alliances a wide range of clergy and laypeople consisted of methodists baptists the salvation army presbyterians episcopalians adventists quakers roman catholics mormons and even secular civic leaders who came to the angelus temple they were welcomed and many made their way to her podium as guest speakers eventually even rev robert p shuler a oncerobust mcpherson critic was featured as a guest preacher because pentecostalism was not popular in the united states during the s mcpherson avoided the label she practiced speakingintongues and faith healing within her services but kept the former to a minimum in sermons to appease mainstream audiences discarded medical fittings from persons faithhealed during her services which included crutches wheelchairs and other paraphernalia were gathered for display in a museum area as evidence of her early influence by the salvation army mcpherson adopted a theme of lighthouses for the satellite churches referring to the parent church as the salvation navy this was the beginning of mcpherson working to plant foursquare gospel churches around the country charitable workedit mcpherson left prepares christmas food baskets about  mcpherson strove to develop a church organization which could not only provide for the spiritual but also the physical needs of the distressed though she fervently believed and preached the imminent return of jesus christ she had no idea of how soon that second coming might be two thoughts pervaded the mind of most devout pentecostals of the time jesus is coming therefore how can i get ready and how can i help others to get ready for mcpherson part of the answer was to mobilize her temple congregation and everyone she could reach through radio telephone and word of mouth to get involved in substantial amounts of charity and social work true christianity is not only to be good but to do good she preached the charities and beneficiary department collected donations for all types of humanitarian relief to include a japanese disaster as well as a german relief fund men released from prison were found jobs by a brotherhood a sisterhood was created as well sewing baby clothing for impoverished mothers branch churches elsewhere in the country were likewise encouraged to follow the angelus temples example even people who considered mcphersons theology almost ridiculous helped out because they saw her church as the best way to assist their community in june  after confirming reports of an earthquake in santa barbara mcpherson immediately left the parsonage and interrupted a broadcast at a nearby radio station she took over the microphone from the startled singer and requested food blankets clothing or whatever listeners could give for emergency supplies to assist nearby santa barbara as the red cross met to discuss and organize aid mcphersons second convoy had already arrived at the troubled city in  after a dam failed and the ensuing flood left up to  dead in its wake mcphersons church led the relief effort later in  an earthquake struck and devastated long beach mcpherson quickly arranged for volunteers to be on the scene with blankets coffee and doughnuts men wait in line to enter aimee semple mcphersons angelus temple free dining hall  commissary located at  w temple street at the time she was married to david hutton and all branding reflected his last name drawing from her childhood experience with the salvation army in  mcpherson opened a commissary at angelus temple which was devised to assist the needy on a much larger formalized scale the commissary was virtually the only place in town a person could get food clothing and blankets with no questions asked it was open  hours a day seven days a week and became active in creating soup kitchens free clinics and other charitable activities as the great depression wore on she fed an estimated  million people when the government shut down the free schoollunch program mcpherson took it over her policy of giving first and investigating afterward allowed waste and a certain number of deadbeats to leech off the program but it alleviated suffering on an epic scale mcpherson got the fire and police departments to assist in distribution doctors physicians and dentists were persuaded to staff her free clinic that trained  nurses to help treat children and the elderly she encouraged individuals and companies of all types to donate supplies food cash or labor to prevent the power from being turned off to homes of overdue accounts during the winter a  cash reserve was set up with the utility company many people who otherwise would have nothing to do with the angelus temple would receive a call from mcpherson and then loot their mansion closets or company stores for something to give the yellow cab company donated a large building and in the first month  people received meals there laboring under a sign everybody and anybody is somebody to jesus volunteer workers filled commissary baskets with an assortment of food and other items as well as foursquare gospel literature and handed them out even a complete kit designed to care for newborn babies was available a reporter wrote he had always thought the breadline was a drab colorless scar on our civilization but of the angelus temple commissary he observed was the warm garment of sympathy and christian succor a note which reflects the sentiment of many of those who received assistance was left in june  at mcphersons virtual gravesite my grandpa always talked about when he was a kid he and his family moved to california from missouri during the depression and his family was starving and they met you and you gave them a bag of vegetables and some money he never forgot it anonymous establishing an employment bureau as well mcpherson desired to help the discouraged husband the despondent widow or the little mother who wants extra work to bear the burden of a sick husband she expected everyone in her temple to be involved let us ever strive to lighten our brothers load and dry the tears of a sister race creed or status make no difference we are all one in the eyes of the lord she encouraged members to think of the commissary as widening the spirituality of the whole church line of unemployed men getting meals at dining hall run by aimee semple mcpherson  in  the commissary was raided by police to allegedly locate a still used to make brandy out of donated apricots some sauerkraut and salad oil were purportedly observed leaking from their respective storage areas as a consequence the commissary was briefly shut down the press got involved and the public demanded an investigation since no one really wanted to stall the temples charity efforts the acceptable solution was to replace the immediate management the staff was let go and students from her foursquare gospel churchs life bible college filled in the newspaper media generally cynical of the temple and in particular of mcpherson recognized the excellent features of that organizations efforts and the faults of the angelus temple are outweighed by its virtues mcpherson issued a statement declaring they have clashed loud their cymbals and blown their trumpets about a still and some sauerkraut our work is still before us ifanybody abused his trust it must not happen again as mcpherson tried to avoid administrative delays in categorizing the deserving from the undeserving her temple commissary became known as one of the regions most effective and inclusive aid institutions few soup kitchens lasted more than several months but mcphersons remained open even as she transformed herself into a fashionable blonde hollywood socialite mcphersons vigor and practicality for social activism did not change she loved organizing big projects a  survey indicated the angelus temple assisted more family units than any other public or private institution in the city because her programs aided nonresidents as well such as migrants from other states and mexico she ran afoul of california state regulations though temple guidelines were later officially adjusted to accommodate those policies helping families in need was a priority regardless of their place of residence actor anthony quinn recalls this was all during the height of the depression when hunger and poverty permeated america many mexicans were terrified of appealing for county help because most of them were in the country illegally when in distress they were comforted by the fact that they could call one of aimees branches at any time of the night there they would never be asked any of the embarrassing questions posed by the authorities the fact that they were hungry or in need of warm clothing was enough no one even asked if they belonged to aimees church or not ministryedit style of ministryedit in august  and away from los angeles mcpherson decided to charter a plane so she would not miss giving her sunday sermon aware of the opportunity for publicity she arranged for at least  followers and members of the press to be present at the airport the plane failed after takeoff and the landing gear collapsed sending the nose of the plane into the ground mcpherson boarded another plane and used the experience as the narrative of an illustrated sunday sermon called the heavenly airplane the stage in angelus temple was set up with two miniature planes and a skyline that looked like los angeles in this sermon mcpherson described how the first plane had the devil for the pilot sin for the engine and temptation as the propeller the other plane however was piloted by jesus and would lead one to the holy city the skyline shown on stage the temple was filled beyond capacity angelus temple completed in  is the center of the international church of the foursquare gospel founded by mcpherson in  angelus temple was designated a national historic landmark it is still in active use on another occasion she described being pulled over by a police officer calling the sermon arrested for speeding dressed in a traffic cops uniform she sat in the saddle of a police motorcycle earlier placed on the stage and revved the siren one author in attendance insisted she actually drove the motorcycle with its deafening roar across the access ramp to the pulpit slammed on the brakes then raised a whitegloved hand to shout stop youre speeding to hell since mcpherson gave some of her sermons more than once and with variations the possibility existed both versions might be true mcpherson employed a small group of artists electricians decorators and carpenters who built the sets for each sundays service religious music was played by an orchestra mcpherson also worked on elaborate sacred operas one production the iron furnace based on the book of exodus told of god’s deliverance as the israelites fled slavery in egypt some hollywood movie stars even assisted with obtaining costumes from local studios the cast was large perhaps as many as  people but so elaborate and expensive it was presented only one time rehearsals for the various productions were timeconsuming and mcpherson did not tolerate any nonsense though described as always kind and loving mcpherson demanded respect regarding the divine message the sacred operas and her other works were designed to convey aimee semple mcpherson surrounded by massed choirs at angelus temple for a musical requiem in  even though mcpherson condemned theater and film as the devils workshop its secrets and effects were coopted she became the first woman evangelist to adopt the whole technique of the moving picture star mcpherson desired to avoid the dreary church service where by obligation parishioners would go to fulfill some duty by being present in the pew she wanted a sacred drama that would compete with the excitement of vaudeville and the movies the message was serious but the tone more along the lines of a humorous musical comedy animals were frequently incorporated and mcpherson the once farm girl knew how to handle them mcpherson gave up to  sermons a week and the lavish sunday night service attracted the largest crowds extra trolleys and police were needed to help route the traffic through echo park to and from angelus temple to finance the angelus temple and its projects collections were taken at every meeting often with the admonishment no coins please mcpherson preached a conservative gospel but used progressive methods taking advantage of radio movies and stage acts advocacy for womens rights was on the rise including womens suffrage through the th amendment she attracted some women associated with modernism but others were put off by the contrast between her different theories by accepting and using such new media outlets mcpherson helped integrate them into people’s daily lives sister mcpherson used the media to her advantage as she became the first modern celebrity preacher minister aimee semple mcpherson and a group of tambourine players leading a service at angelus temple she was very innovative in producing weekly dramas illustrating religious themes the battle between fundamentalists and modernists escalated after world war i with many modernists seeking less conservative religious faiths fundamentalists generally believed their religious faith should influence every aspect of their lives mcpherson sought to eradicate modernism and secularism in homes churches schools and communities she developed a strong following in what mcpherson termed the foursquare gospel by blending contemporary culture with religious teachings mcpherson was entirely capable of sustaining a protracted intellectual discourse as her bible students and debate opponents will attest but she believed in preaching the gospel with simplicity and power so as to not confuse the message her distinct voice and visual descriptions created a crowd excitement bordering on hysteria the appeal of mcphersons  or so revival events from  to  surpassed any touring event of theater or politics ever presented in american history neither houdini nor teddy roosevelt had such an audience nor pt barnum her one to fourweek meetings typically overflowed any building she could find to hold them she broke attendance records recently set by billy sunday and frequently used his temporary tabernacle structures in which to hold some of her meetings her revivals were often standingroom only one such revival was held in a boxing ring with the meeting before and after the match throughout the boxing event she walked about with a sign reading knock out the devil in san diego california the city called in the national guard and other branches of the armed forces to control a revival crowd over  people she became one of the most photographed persons of her time she enjoyed the publicity and quotes on almost every subject were sought from her by journalists faith healing ministryedit main article faith healing ministry of aimee semple mcpherson mcphersons ability to draw crowds was also greatly assisted by her apparently successful faith healing presentations almost by accident she discovered when she laid hands on sick or injured persons they got well one early mcpherson biographer nancy barr mavity described the healing power beyond her conscience sic control and profoundly troubling however a phenomenon familiar to the psychiatrist although none the less sic mysterious  during a  revival meeting in corona long island new york a young woman in the advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis was brought to the altar by friends mcpherson would have preferred to pray with her privately however the woman insisted upon immediate prayer mcpherson laid hands on her and prayed before the gathered parishioners the woman walked out of the church without crutches mcphersons reputation as a faith healer rapidly became known and the sick and injured people came to her by the tens of thousands the faith healing ministry of aimee semple mcpherson was extensively written about in the news media and was a large part of her early career legacy no one has ever been credited by secular witnesses with anywhere near the numbers of faith healings attributed to mcpherson especially during the years  to  over time though she almost withdrew from the faithhealing aspect of her services since it was overwhelming other areas of her ministry scheduled weekly and monthly healing sessions nevertheless remained highly popular with the public until her death in  the foursquare churchedit foursquare church logo eventually mcphersons church evolved into its own denomination and became known as the international church of the foursquare gospel usually referenced as the foursquare church foursquare is an alternative word for full gospel a term used by pentecostals referencing the nature of christs character that he was savior baptizer with the holy spirit healer and sooncoming king the four main beliefs were the first being christs ability to transform individuals lives through the act of salvation the second focused on a holy baptism which includes receiving power to glorify and exalt christ in a practical way the third was divine healing newness of life for both body and spirit and the fourth was gospeloriented heed to the premillennial return of jesus christ mcpherson published the weekly foursquare crusader along with her monthly magazine bridal call she began broadcasting on radio in the early s on a sunday morning in april  the rockridge radio station in oakland ca offered her some radio time and she became the first woman to preach a sermon over the wireless telephone with the opening of foursquare gospelowned kfsg on february   she became the second woman granted a broadcast license by the department of commerce the federal agency that supervised broadcasting in the early s mcpherson racially integrated her tent meetings and church services on one occasion as a response to mcphersons ministry and angelus temple being integrated ku klux klan members were in attendance but after the service hoods and robes were found on the ground in nearby echo park she is also credited with helping many hispanic ministries in los angeles mcpherson traveling about the country holding widely popular revival meetings and filling local churches with converts was one thing settling permanently into their city caused concern among some local los angeles churches though she shared many of their fundamentalist beliefs such as divine inspiration of the bible the classical trinity virgin birth of jesus historical reality of christs miracles bodily resurrection of christ and the atoning purpose of his crucifixion the presentation of lavish sermons and an effective faithhealing ministry presented by a female divorcee whom thousands adored and about whom newspapers continuously wrote was unexpected moreover the temple especially the women had a look and style uniquely theirs they would emulate mcphersons style and dress and a distinct angelus temple uniform came into existence a white dress with a navy blue cape thrown over it men were more discreet wearing suits her voice projected over the powerful stateoftheart kfsg radio station and heard by hundreds of thousands became the most recognized in the western united states mcpherson preaching at the newly built angelus temple in  her messages showcased the love of god redemption and the joys of service and heaven contrasting sharply with the fireandbrimstone style of sermon delivery popular with many of her peers her illustrated sermons attracted criticism from some clergy members because they thought it turned the gospel message into mundane theater and entertainment divine healing as mcpherson called it was claimed by many pastors to be a unique dispensation granted only for apostolic times rival radio evangelist reverend robert p shuler published a pamphlet entitled mcphersonism which purported that her most spectacular and advertised program was out of harmony with gods word debates such as the bogardmcpherson debate in  drew further attention to the controversy but none could really argue effectively against mcphersons results the new developing assemblies of god denomination pentecostal as mcpherson was for a time worked with her but they encouraged separation from established protestant faiths mcpherson resisted trends to isolate as a denomination and continued her task of coalitionbuilding among evangelicals mcpherson worked hard to attain ecumenical vision of the faith and while she participated in debates avoided pitched rhetorical battles that divided so many in christianity she wanted to work with existing churches on projects and to share with them her visions and beliefs assisting in her passion was the speedy establishment of life bible college adjacent to the angeles temple ministers trained there were originally intended to go nationally and worldwide to all denominations and share her newly defined foursquare gospel a wellknown methodist minister frank thompson who never had the pentecostal experience was persuaded to run the college and he taught the students the doctrine of john wesley mcpherson and others meanwhile infused them with pentecostal ideals for about a year antonia frederick futterer suggested by los angeles times as the inspiration for steven spielbergs film character indiana jones was also a facility member mcphersons efforts eventually led pentecostals which were previously unconventional and on the periphery of christianity into the mainstream of american evangelicalism life in the media spotlightedit media relationsedit by early  mcpherson had become one of the most charismatic and influential women and ministers of her time her fame equaled to name a few charles lindbergh johnny weissmuller jack dempsey babe ruth ty cobb knute rockne bobby jones louise brooks and rudolph valentino she was a major american phenomenon who along with some other highprofile preachers of the time unlike hollywood celebrities could be admired by their adoring public without apparently compromising their souls according to carey mcwilliams she had become more than just a household word she was a folk hero and a civic institution an honorary member of the fire and police departments a patron saint of the service clubs an official spokesman for the community on problems grave and frivolous she was influential in many social educational and political areas mcpherson made personal crusades against anything that she felt threatened her christian ideals including the drinking of alcohol and teaching evolution in schools mcpherson became a strong supporter of william jennings bryan during the  scopes trial in which john scopes was tried for illegally teaching evolution at a dayton tennessee school bryan and mcpherson had worked together in the angelus temple and they believed darwinism had undermined students morality according to the new yorker mcpherson said evolution is the greatest triumph of satanic intelligence in  years of devilish warfare against the hosts of heaven it is poisoning the minds of the children of the nation she sent bryan a telegram saying ten thousand members of angelus temple with her millions of radio church membership send grateful appreciation of your lionhearted championship of the bible against evolution and throw our hats in the ring with you she organized an allnight prayer service a massive church meeting preceded by a bible parade through los angeles politicsedit while her mother mildred kennedy was a registered democrat no one was certain of mcphersons registration she endorsed herbert hoover over franklin d roosevelt but enthusiastically threw her support behind the latter and his social programs when he was elected into office she was a patron of organized labor preaching a gangsters money was no more unclean than the dollars of the man who amasses his millions from underpaid factory workers she was more cautious though when labor strikes resulted in violent uprisings she saw in them the possible activities of communism which sought to infiltrate labor unions and other organizations mcpherson intensely disliked communism and its derivatives as they sought to rule without god their ultimate goal she believed was to remove christianity from the earth mcphersons opinion of fascism fared no better its totalitarian rule was wrongly justified by claiming to represent the power of god mcpherson did not align herself consistently with any broad conservative or liberal political agenda instead she explained if christianity occupied a central place in national life and if the components of god home school and government were kept together everything else would fall into place remove any of these she warned and civilization topples crumbles current foursquare gospel church leaders qualify the evangelists views mcpherson’s passion to see america sustained in spiritual health which compelled her quest to see the church influence government must be interpreted in light of the political and religious climate of the s s and s it is not accurate to draw a parallel between today’s extreme fundamentalist rightwing christianity and the style or focus of sister mcpherson she was also among the first prominent christian ministers to defend the establishment of a jewish homeland in palestine she related that when christ returns the jews would receive him their suffering will end and they will establish at jerusalem a kingdom more wonderful than the world has known reported kidnappingedit disappearance from venice beachedit main article reported kidnapping of aimee semple mcpherson minnie

media and changed her life and the course of her career after disappearing in may  she reappeared in mexico five weeks later stating she had been held for ransom in a desert shack there the subsequent

venice beach to swim soon after arriving mcpherson was nowhere to be found it was thought she had drowned searchers combed the beach and nearby area but could not locate her body the angelus temple received letters and calls claiming knowledge of mcpherson including demands for ransom mcpherson sightings occurred around the country often in widely divergent locations many miles apart on the same day as a precaution the ransom notes were sent to the police who investigated at least one of them mildred kennedy though regarded the messages as hoaxes believing her daughter dead as the angelus temple prepared for a memorial service commemorating mcphersons death kennedy received a phone call from douglas arizona her daughter was alive the distraught mcpherson was resting in a douglas

occasionally visiting when at last all her captors were away on errands she escaped out a window using a mountain as a landmark she traveled through the desert for around – hours across an estimated distance of  miles  km around  am she reached agua prieta sonora a mexican border town and collapsed near a house there she was assisted by the residents and finally taken to adjacent douglas return to los angelesedit after leaving douglas mcpherson was greeted at the los angeles train station by – people more than for almost any other personage the parade back to the temple even elicited a greater turnout than president woodrow wilsons visit to los angeles in  attesting to her popularity and the growing influence of mass media entertainment already incensed over mcphersons influential public stance on evolution and the bible most of the chamber of commerce and some other civic leaders saw the event as gaudy display nationally embarrassing to the city many los angeles area churches were also annoyed the story received nationwide coverage then speculations together with alleged witnesses began to emerge that her disappearance might have been caused by other than the kidnapping event mcpherson described against the wishes of her mother who thought the press would continue to unfavorably exploit the story mcpherson decided for vindication and presented her complaint in court a grand jury inquiry convened to determine if enough evidence could be found to indict any kidnappers however pressured by various influential community groups the court instead intensely investigated mcpherson her family and acquaintances to determine if the kidnapping was fabricated district attorney asa keyes led the prosecution against her he was known for winning convictions but six persons he sent to prison were found to be innocent and pardoned by the state governor grand jury inquiryedit the grand jury inquiries were first convened on july   adjourned and reconvened holding sessions through the summer of  accompanied by intense media interest the proceedings were supposed to be secret as per california law though the los angeles court spoke about it to the newspapers issues of trial by media and court of public opinion were apparent as much of the proclaimed evidence against mcpherson came from reporters who featured it in their news articles and passed it on to the police mcpherson also eschewed secrecy and freely used her radio station to broadcast her side of the story evidence and testimonies were hotly debated by an evenly divided public on november  the case was determined to be moved to jury trial set for midjanuary  along with mcpherson and her mother several other defendants were charged in the inquiry if convicted the counts added up to maximum prison time of  years various speculations were proffered by the news media and prosecution as to the reason for mcphersons disappearance the one they settled on most strongly was she ran off with an exemployee kenneth ormiston she was accused of staying with him in a california resort town cottage until may  the time frame of ormistons seaside cottage rental coincided with the first  days of her disappearance however a missing threeweek period afterwards was not accounted for with any evidence in court by the prosecution in response the evangelist maintained all along without changing anything in her story that she was taken held captive by the kidnappers and escaped as she originally described as the prosecution tried to break down her story defense witnesses corroborated her assertions  or mcpherson herself demonstrated how the disputed parts were plausible in contrast the prosecutions case developed serious credibility issues witnesses changed their testimonies and evidence often had suspicious origins or was mishandled while in custody finally on january   ormiston identified elizabeth tovey a nurse from seattle washington as his female companion and the woman who stayed with him at the seaside cottage all charges against mcpherson and associated parties were dropped by the court for the lack of evidence on january   after the case dismissaledit regardless of the courts decision months of unfavorable press reports fixed in much of the publics mind a certainty of mcphersons wrongdoing the newspapers had a vested interest in keeping the controversy going since it generated huge sales the bulk of the investigation against mcpherson was funded by los angelesarea newspapers at an estimated amount of  some supporters thought mcpherson should have insisted on the jury trial and clear her name the grand jury inquiry concluded while enough evidence did not exist to try her it did not indicate her story was true with its implication of kidnappers still at large court costs to mcpherson were estimated to be as high as  a jury trial could take months mcpherson moved on to other projects in  she published a book about her version of the kidnapping in the service of the king the story of my life various influential individuals offered their opinions on the inquiry in a letter to the los angeles times a few months after the case was dropped the reverend robert p shuler stated perhaps the most serious thing about this whole situation is the seeming loyalty of thousands to this leader in the face of her evident and positively proven guilt hl mencken noted journalist satirist cultural critic and scholar and an ideological opponent of mcpherson opposite each other in the  scopes monkey trial also commented he wrote that since many of that towns residents acquired their ideas of the true the good and the beautiful from the movies and newspapers los angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her claims of extramarital affairsedit during her lifetimeedit numerous allegations of illicit love affairs were often directed against mcpherson suspected lovers generally denied involvement for example kenneth ormiston a married man with a small son could have profited immensely from an exposé about himself and mcpherson whether the two had a good working relationship and were friendly with each other was not disputed during the  kidnapping grand jury trial reporters and investigators tried to link him amorously to mcpherson ormiston told newspapers his name connected in such a way to the evangelist was a gross insult to a noble and sincere woman mcpherson was often the target of numerous unsubstantiated sexually related allegations as reported by the los angeles times june   this photograph depicts the evangelist reading a note demanding  else nude motion pictures of her and a friend would be publicly released when inquired about it in an unrelated interview later that year she tersely stated nude pictures of her did not exist because none were ever taken alarmed by her rapidly changing style of dress and involvement with hollywood and its worldly lifestyle in  an angelus temple official hired detectives to shadow mcpherson through her windows the detectives frequently saw mcpherson staying up until the early morning hours composing songs drafting sacred operas and scribbling diagrams of her illustrated sermons they were looking for evidence of her indiscretions but found nothing no confirmation of adulterous misconduct with perhaps exception of her third marriage as a violation of church tenets was ever presented mcpherson herself aware of numerous accusations leveled at her throughout her career responded only to a small fraction of them conveying the only thing she had time for was preaching jesus posthumouslyedit posthumously unsubstantiated allegations of extramarital affairs continued to emerge this time by those who stated to have been her partner claims not mentioned by them or others while she was still alive canadian journalist gordon sinclair implied such a claim in his  autobiography will the real gordon sinclair please stand up sinclair stated he worked on a story with mcpherson and during one of those times in  the incident purportedly occurred sinclair alluded to a sexual dalliance with mcpherson one afternoon along with some gin and ginger thirty years after her death another claim by comedian milton berle in a  autobiography alleges a brief affair with the evangelist in his book titled milton berle an autobiography berle asserts he met mcpherson at the shrine auditorium in los angeles where both were doing a charity show biographer matthew avery sutton commented berle a notorious womanizer whose many tales of scandalous affairs were not always true claimed to have had sex with mcpherson on this and one other occasion both during a year when mcpherson was often ill and bedridden sutton noted that berles story of a crucifix in mcphersons bedroom was not consistent with the coolness of pentecostalcatholic relations during that era another book by milton berle laughingly yours which had autobiographical content that was published in  while mcpherson was still alive did not have this claim author raymond l cox states mrs mcphersons daughter roberta salter of new york told me mother never had an apartment in her life by  she kept herself securely chaperoned to guard against such allegations during  the evangelists appearances and whereabouts can be traced almost every day she was incapacitated with illness a full five months of that year and there is no place on her schedule as reported in her publications and church and travel records for the benefit berle alleged besides roberta also told cox mother never did a benefit in her life she had her own charities later life and careeredit mcpherson surrounded by flowers cutting into angelus temple cake  not one for settling into a predictable routine she used her birthday national holidays and other events as themes for church services and gala festivities after fallout with pressedit following her heyday in the s mcpherson carried on with her ministry but fell out of favor with the press they once dubbed her the miracle worker or miracle woman reporting extensively on her faithhealing demonstrations but now were anxious to relay every disturbance in her household to the headlines her developing difficulties with her mother mildred kennedy were starting to take the front page yet mcpherson emerged from the kidnapping nationally famous as much as  of the population in los angeles held membership in her temple for a time movie studios competed with each other offering mcpherson longterm contracts believing that talking pictures had the potential to transform christianity mcpherson explored hollywood culture and appeared in newsreels alongside other famous individuals such as mary pickford frances perkins and franklin d roosevelt she lost weight cut and dyed her hair began to wear makeup and jewelry and became stylish and wellattired a critic wrote mcpherson can outdress the hollywood stars the solicitation of fame justified to draw audiences to her and hence to christ was more than some in her church organization could accept they yearned for sister aimee in the old time dress referring to her previous trademarked uniform of a navy cape over a white servants dress both purchased inexpensively in bargain basements other members though loved it and her angelus temple services were as popular as ever and remained so throughout her life unless parishioners arrived to a service early frequently they could not get in all seats were taken now that she could afford it mcpherson thought as well she wanted her apparel and display to be the best she could present to jesus in early  mcpherson immediately set out on a vindication tour visiting various cities and taking advantage of the publicity her kidnapping story created to preach the gospel her visit to new york in foxfurs and a finely trimmed yellow suit was noted in the society pages she visited even nightclubs to include a famous speakeasy in new york texas guinan’s three hundred club on th street while mcpherson sipped water at her table guinan asked if she would speak a few words to the patrons delighted mcpherson stood and addressed the jazzed and boozy crowd behind all these beautiful clothes behind these good times in the midst of your lovely buildings and shops and pleasures there is another life there is something on the other side “what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul” with all your getting and playing and good times do not forget you have a lord take him into your hearts the unexpected speech that did not judge and had a conciliatory tone between them and the divine earned a thoughtful moment of silence from the crowd then an applause that went on for much longer than the speech took the revelers were invited to hear her preach at the glad tidings tabernacle on rd street the visits to speakeasies and nightclubs added to mcphersons notoriety newspapers reported heavily on them rumors erroneously conveyed she was drinking smoking and dancing and her mother along with some other church members did not understand mcphersons strategy of tearing down barriers between the secular and religious world between the sinner and the saved problems with mildred kennedyedit without mildred kennedys conservative financial management replacement administrators embarked on a spread of ambitious projects that often failed an example of this was lake tahoe lot deals of which the cover of an alleged prospectus describes not enough parcels of land were purchased and the subsequent lawsuit brought by investors drew unfavorable publicity and the attention of the district attorneys office in the summer of  mildred kennedy mcphersons mother left the angelus temple in an attempt to curtail her daughters influence and officially transfer more power to herself kennedy initiated a staffmember vote of confidence against mcpherson but lost the two had heatedly argued over management polices and mcphersons changing personal dress and appearance for similar reasons  members of the choir left as well the choir could be replaced however kennedys financial and administrative skills had been of crucial importance in growing mcphersons ministry from tent revivals to satellite churches and maintaining its current activities in the temple a series of less able management staff replaced kennedy and the temple became involved in various questionable projects such as hotel building cemetery plots and land sales accordingly the angelus temple plummeted deep into debt in response to the difficulties kennedy came back in late  but because of continued serious disagreements with mcpherson tendered her resignation on july   the following month mcpherson suffered a physical and nervous breakdown for  months she was absent from the pulpit diagnosed in part with acute acidosis resurrecting her careeredit when she gained strength and returned she introduced with renewed vigor her moving attar of roses sermon based on the song of solomon with its rose of sharon as the mystical body of christ while journalists attending her sunday illustrated sermons assumed her language was fit only for slapstick or sentimental entertainment scholars who have studied her work for bible students and small prayer groups found instead the complex discourse of neoplatonic interpretation the old testament book the song of solomon for example she had hundreds of pages written about it each different from one another as snowflakes the october –  revival in boston started out sluggishly and many predicted its failure a los angeles newspaper ran headlines of the flop and expected more of the same in the days to come on opening night mcpherson spoke to fewer than  persons in the seat sports arena and safety pins and rubber bands abundantly cluttered the collection baskets the city had large populations of unitarians episcopalians and catholics venerable denominations traditionally hostile to a pentecostal or fundamentalist message afterwards from her hotel room mcpherson known to be a sports fan asked for the afternoons world series scores and a boston herald reporter sent her a copy of the sunday edition the next day the bring back the bible to boston campaigns tone shifted as mcpherson took greater control and attendance climbed sharply a reporter took note of mcphersons stage presence different from any other evangelist who spoke there gesturing with her white bible for effect as well as preaching answering him as to why she presented a dramatic sermon she stated our god is a dramatic god rolling back the red sea elijah on the mountaintop the crucifixion the resurrection his ascension tongues of fire on the day of pentecost the final day of afternoon and evening services had  persons attending the stadium was full and more than  had to be turned away a total of  people attended the meetings breaking historic attendance records of any nine days of revival services in boston her revival in new york city was not very fruitful as her sensationalistic reputation preceded her the third marriage to david hutton rumored romances and her kidnapping was what its press and citizens wanted to hear about therefore after a brief pause in new york and washington dc she went on philadelphia and other cities traveling to  of them in  states speaking to as much as  of the entire population of the united states a full crew of musicians scene designers and costumers accompanied mcpherson in this her last national revival tour between september  and december   two million persons heard  sermons many more were reached by  radio stations the boston evening traveler newspaper reported aimees religion is a religion of joy there is happiness in it her voice is easy to listen to she does not appeal to the brain and try to hammer religion into the heads of her audience rather she appeals to the hearts of her hearers she radiates friendliness she creates an atmosphere that is warming she is persuasive rather than forceful gracious and kindly rather than compelling fundamentally she takes the whole bible literally from cover to cover nevertheless she was not a radical literalist in an informal meeting with some harvard students mcpherson told them that genesis allowed great latitude of interpretation and that neither she nor the bible insisted the world was created only  years ago in another meeting with students she heard their assertion the teachings of christ have outlived their usefulness education science and cold reasoning were the new saviors of the world thus compelled mcpherson decided to travel and look at the world with new eyes in  mcpherson embarked on a worldwide sixmonth discovery tour to examine the social religious and economic climates of many countries at one point it was earlier reported she wanted to study the womens movement in connection with the campaign for the independence of india and was anxious to have a chat with mahatma gandhi she received an invitation from him and he gave her a sari made from threads woven from his simple spinning wheel impressed with gandhi and his ideas mcpherson thought he might secretly lean towards christianity his dedication possibly coming from catching a glimpse of the cleansing lifting strengthening power of the nazarene other highlights included traversing barefoot in myanmar the lengthy stone path to the great pagoda a goldcovered ft tiered tower enshrining relics of four buddhas which caught and reflected the rays of the sun a vision of breathtaking glory she heard benito mussolini speak in italy and fretted war would again ensue in the rain at verdun france she sat on a wrecked military vehicle in mournful contemplation of the hundreds of thousands who died on the stilluncleared battlefield white bleached bones of the fallen poked out of the earth and nearby laborers toiled carefully at their dangerous iron harvest collecting old munitions for disposal in mid a delegation who had been involved with the  azusa street mission revivals including emma cotton asked if they could use the angelus temple for their th anniversary celebration the original mission building was demolished and its land unavailable african american evangelist emma cotton and mcpherson therefore organized a series of meetings which also marked her enthusiastic reidentification with the pentecostal movement mcphersons experiments of hollywood celebrity ambitions coexisting with her ministry were not as successful as she hoped alliances with other church groups were failing or no longer in effect and she searched for ways to start again therefore she looked to her spiritual origins and allowed for the possibility of reintroducing even the more alarming aspects of the pentecostal experience into her public meetings temple officials were concerned the azusa people might bring in some wildfire and holy rollerism mcpherson indicated she would turn hand springs with them as needed to see the power of god manifest the azusa street revival commemoration events brought numbers of black leaders to her pulpit the original attendees of the azusa revivals filled the angelus temple along with every ethnic minority the saints who were once smelted together with the fires of pentecost were being reunited rewelded and rejuvenated mcpherson recommitted herself to the dissemination of classic pentecostalism and her concern now was that foursquaredom was in the danger of becoming too churchy for the first time since the temple opened mcpherson began to publicly deliver some of her messages in tongues mcpherson traversed the line between cold formality and wildfire and now decided it was easier to cool down a hot fanatic than to resuscitate a corpse future meetings to celebrate the azusa street revivals included guest charles h mason a founder of the churches of god in christ mason an azusa leader was also one of the most significant african american religious figures in united states history and was frequently hosted at the angelus temple roberta star semple left mcphersons daughter aimee semplemcpherson middle and rheba crawford splivalo assistant pastorright at a parade in  problems with the templeedit also in  mcpherson reassigned staff responsibilities in an effort to address the temples financial difficulties this together with other unresolved issues accelerated simmering tensions among various staff members rumors circulated that angel of broadway charismatic evangelist rheba crawford splivalo who had been working extensively with mcpherson for several years planned to take the angelus temple from her mcpherson asked splivalo to leave town in the course of the staff controversy mcphersons lawyer issued a strongly worded press release that upset roberta star semple mcphersons daughter and led her to initiate a  lawsuit against him for slander splivalo also sued mcpherson for  because of alleged statements calling her a ‘jezebel and a judas’ and unfit to stand in the angelus temple pulpit the two lawsuits filed by semple and splivalo were not related but mcpherson did not see it that way she saw both as part of the temple takeover plot mcphersons mother was also involved and sided with semple her granddaughter making unflattering statements about mcpherson to the press in these charged circumstances mcphersons defense of herself and her lawyer in a public trial was dramatic and theatrical she testified tearfully with swoons and faints about how her daughter conspired with others against her her daughters lawyer meanwhile mocked mcpherson by imitating her mannerisms and making faces at her the trial did much to estrange mcpherson from her daughter the judge ruled for semple giving a  judgment in her favor semple then moved to new york splivalo and the temple settled their suit out of court for the cause of religion and the good of the community with kennedy semple and splivalo gone the temple lost much of its talented leadership however mcpherson found a competent and firm administrator in giles knight who was able to bring the temple out of debt dispose of the  or so lawsuits and eliminate the more spurious projects he sequestered mcpherson allowed her to receive only a few personal visitors and carefully regulated her activities outside the temple this period was one of unprecedented creativity for mcpherson no longer distracted by waves of reporters reams of lawsuits and innumerable individuals demanding her attention she became very accomplished in her illustrative sermon style of gospel preaching the irreligious charlie chaplin would secretly attend her services enjoying her sermons she later met and consulted with chaplin on ways to improve her presentations mcpherson who earlier blared across newspaper headlines as many as three times a week in one alleged scandal or another had her public image much improved her adversary reverend robert p shuler who previously attacked her by radio magazine pulpit and pamphlet proclaimed aimees missionary work was the envy of methodists he also expressed his support of her foursquare church application admittance into national association of evangelicals for united action in  her efforts at making interracial revival a reality at angelus temple continued she welcomed blacks into the congregation and pulpit while race riots burned detroit in  mcpherson publicly converted the notorious black former heavyweight champion jack johnson on the temple stage and embraced him “as he raised his hand in worship” war yearsedit views on waredit pacifism which was a component of pentecostalism was evaluated by the foursquare gospel church in the s with official statements and documents which were further revised by mcpherson a press quote attributed to mcpherson in reference to mahatma gandhi appears to explore the concept i want to incorporate the ideals of india with my own additionally clinton howard the chairman of the world peace commission was invited to speak at the angelus temple in  she promoted disarmament if the nations of the world would stop building warships and equipping armies we would be all but overwhelmed with prosperity foursquare leaders alarmed at rapid changes of technology especially sea and air which challenged the united states isolation and security decided to officially draw up an amendment inclusive of varied opinions in regards to military service the idea that one could trust to bear arms in a righteous cause as well as believing the killing of others even in connection to military service would endanger their souls both views were acceptable reaction to waredit mcpherson kept a canny eye on the international events leading up to the second world war citing the probability of a much more terrible conflict than the one that passed  years earlier in a sermon she described a recently conquered country which had the cross and other religious symbols in their schools removed in their place was a portrait of a certain man instead of prayer their school day began with a distinctive salute to this person the destructive apocalypse of john the apostle with its expected high civilian casualties followed by the second coming of christ it seemed was at hand even if submarines were hiding in the depths of the sea they could not escape the terror that would befall them congregation at angelus temple during hour holy ghost service led by aimee semple mcpherson los angeles calif  allnight prayer meetings were held friday nights at the angelus temple starting in  the year when germany was overrunning belgium the netherlands and france she asked other foursquare churches around the country to follow suit she sent president franklin roosevelts secretary mr stephen early as well as some other leaders an outline of her plans prayer to her was even more powerful than the implements of war various officials expressed their appreciation including the governor of california early passed on a reply back from roosevelt a message of thanks for her work a month later roosevelt declared a national day of prayer to beseech the ruler of the universe to bless our republic foursquare leaders thought mcpherson may have inspired it and perhaps the president of the united states was looking to her for spiritual leadership of the nation at the outbreak of world war ii mcpherson rejected the christian pacifism of many in the pentecostal movement including those of her own church her mind was set on doing what ever it took to assist the united states in winning the war it is the bible against mein kampf it is the cross against the swastika it is god against the antichrist of japan this is no time for pacifism the angelus temple itself became a visible symbol of home front sacrifice for the war effort if necessary it was announced the building could be used for an air raid shelter the distinctive white dome was painted over with black paint and its beautiful stainedglass windows were covered up the temple like other buildings in the city had to have any opening or window that could emit visible light at night covered one evening in may  to advertise the need to conserve gasoline and rubber mcpherson herself drove a horse and buggy to the angelus temple rubber and other drives were organized and unlimited airtime on her radio station kfsg was given to the office of war information she asked parishioners and other listeners to donate two hours a day for such tasks as rolling bandages so that a soldiers bandage could be changed and let us give our blood to help every one money was raised to provide local military bases with comfortable furnishings and radios newsweek published an article about mcpherson the worlds greatest living minister on july   noting she had collected  pints of blood for the red cross servicemen in her audience are especially honored and the climax of her church services is when she reads the national anthem mcpherson gave visiting servicemen autographed bibles she observed they often had no religious affiliation and did not even own a bible she wrote what a privilege it was to invite the servicemen present in every sunday night meeting to come to the platform where i greeted them gave each one a new testament and knelt in prayer with them for their spiritual needs and god’s guidance and protection on their lives later when the altar call would be given many of these same servicemen would make another trip to the platform publicly to receive jesus christ as their personal savior she insulted adolf hitler and hideki tōjō and became involved in war bond rallies pershing squares victory house in los angeles never saw a bigger crowd mcpherson sold  worth of bonds in one hour on june   breaking all previous records then repeated the performance again on july   the us treasury awarded her a special citation the army made mcpherson an honorary colonel her wartime activities included sermons that linked the church and american patriotism mcpherson spoke to the men in uniform of her belief that military action against the axis powers was long overdue and more so than in almost any war previously she felt that if they did not prevail churches homes and everything precious and dear to the christian would absolutely be destroyed mcphersons embrace of the total war strategy of the united states left her open to some criticism the line between the church as an independent moral authority monitoring government became blurred perceived instead as complicit with that same governance wrongs being done to japanese americans through their internment in relocation camps were being overlooked for example and she refused to allow her denomination to support christians who remained committed pacifists even if conscientious objectors were willing to participate in noncombat roles more was needed church members and leaders had to be willing to take up arms and fight for the united states the pacifist clause which earlier existed was by her proposal voted upon and eliminated by foursquare gospel church leaders deathedit mcphersons grave on september   mcpherson went to oakland california for a series of revivals planning to preach her popular story of my life sermon when mcphersons son went to her hotel room at  the next morning he found her unconscious with pills and a halfempty bottle of capsules nearby she was dead by  it was later discovered she previously called her doctor that morning to complain about feeling ill from the medicine but he was in surgery and could not be disturbed she then phoned another doctor who referred her to yet another physician however mcpherson apparently lost consciousness before the third could be contacted the autopsy did not conclusively determine the cause of mcphersons death she had been taking sleeping pills following numerous health problems – including tropical fever among the pills found in the hotel room was the barbiturate seconal a strong sedative which had not been prescribed for her it was unknown how she obtained them the coroner said she most likely died of an accidental overdose compounded by kidney failure the cause of death is officially listed as unknown given the circumstances there was speculation about suicide but most sources generally agree the overdose was accidental as stated in the coroners report fortyfive thousand people waited in long lines some until  am to file past the evangelist where for three days her body lay in state at the angelus temple within a mileandahalf  m radius of the church police had to double park cars it later took  trucks to transport the  worth of flowers to the cemetery which itself received more telegrammed floral orders than at any time since will rogers death almost  years earlier a foursquare leader noted that to watch the long line pass reverently by her casket and see tears shed by all types of people regardless of class and color helped give understanding to the farreaching influence of her life and ministry an observer marcus bach who was on a spiritual odyssey of personal discovery wrote roberta who had married an orchestra director flew in from new york ma kennedy was at the grave rheba crawford splivalo had returned to say that there was never a greater worker for god than sister a thousand ministers of the foursquare gospel paid their tearful tribute the curious stood by impressed the poor who had always been fed at angelus were there the lost who had been spiritfilled the healed the faithful here they were eager to immortalize the ontario farm girl who loved the lord here they laid the body of sister aimee to rest in the marble sarcophagus guarded by two great angels on sunrise slope  millions of dollars passed through mcphersons hands however when her personal estate was calculated it amounted to  to her daughter roberta went  the remainder to her son rolf by contrast her mother mildred kennedy had a  severance settlement of as much as  in cash and property the foursquare church itself was worth  million mcpherson is buried in forest lawn memorial park cemetery in glendale california following her death the foursquare gospel church denomination was led for  years by her son rolf mcpherson the church claims a membership of over  million worldwide legacy and influenceedit ministryedit mcphersons ministry continued to flourish even in the face of scandal the newspapers which served to propel mcpherson to fame and advertise her message also were used to highlight her faults real and imagined some modern televangelists who transgressed and faded into obscurity because of highprofile news coverage also learned how quickly modern communication media could hurt as well as help them after her death the largely negative aspect of her media image persisted was cultivated and became the dominant factor in defining mcpherson for many in the public today reverend robert p shuler whose caustic view of mcpherson softened over the years wrote he could not figure out why god chose such a person the flaws he observed in mcpherson were by his opinion many yet she ultimately made a positive impact on christianity long lasting and enduring  he recognized her appeal was a combination of identifying with the average citizen as well as an ability to explain the gospel in simple easily understandable terms drawing them irresistibly to her services while great cathedral churches closed their doors on sunday night the crowds pushed through her portals in one everflowing stream he saw her legacy extend far beyond the glamor of hollywood exerting itself through the thousands of ministers she trained and churches planted throughout the world mcpherson together with the alliances she made worked to reshape the evangelical christian faith making it relevant to american culture and personally involving for those in the audience legacyedit uldine utley c  in fresno california  nineyearold uldine utley – became a fervent believer after hearing mcphersons dramatic retelling of the david and goliath story the young girl tearfully gave her life over to christ and dedicated herself to be a little david for the lord and fight goliath with her parents as managers she went on to preach to millions of people and converted many thousands the most notable of these was john sung who would become a major evangelical figure in china utley frequently used the same metaphors as mcpherson referring to christ as the rose of sharon and invoking bride of christ imagery during the great depression years as a child dr edwin louis coles mother attended life bible college and as he grew up cole participated in various angelus temple activities witnessing the miraculous cole went on to found the christian mens network and influenced many including bill mccartney founder of promise keepers pat robertson john maxwell president of injoy ministries kenneth copeland oliver north and chuck norris according biographer matthew avery sutton in the early s it was expected traditional protestantism would give way to rapidly developing new philosophical ideas and sciences that were being widely taught mcpherson contributed immensely to the forestalling of that predicted inevitability liberal christianity which enjoyed strong growth starting in the late th century regarded many of the miracles of jesus to be superstitious interpretations of what actually occurred or metaphors for his teachings mcphersons faithhealing demonstrations instead gave credence to onlookers her claim was true jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever this bible verse of hebrews  as biographer daniel mark epstein noted as per mcpherson meant jesus still had power and could heal as in ancient times and the verse become the motto of her foursquare gospel church sutton wrote conveying it was easy for many people to deny a god who did something  years ago but large crowds of people were now witness to the blind seeing the lame walking and the deaf hearing healings at her services according to epstein from period news sources were occurring faster than the journalists could write them down crowds clamored to reach her altar to experience a new testament conversion that transformed many of their lives even large portions of the secular public admired her the old time gospel message was being dramatically marketed by the most technologically advanced means possible reconstructing it into something far more interesting and desirable than it was previously mcphersons ecumenical approach assisted pentecostals in learning how better to explain their faith in the context of historic church doctrine mainline churches became exposed to the more unusual gifts of the holy spirit they also benefited by borrowing pentecostal revival techniques such as more emotive expression joyful praise worship and testimonials forerunning the charismatic movement mcpherson challenged what was expected from women females as preachers and her status as a divorcee with two failed marriages were of particular concern to many of the fundamentalist churches with which she wanted to work but her success could not be easily ignored meanwhile secular society broadly labeled women as either victorian ladies or whores and she bounced from one category to the other she had her extensive relief charities and along with it titillating scandals atheist charles lee smith remarked publicly of mcpherson just before a debate that she had an extraordinary mind particularly for a woman her continual work at church alliancebuilding finally bore fruit in an official way though she did not live to see it foursquare gospel church leaders were at last able to join the national association of evangelicals in  and from there helped organize the pentecostal world fellowship which exists to the present day pentecostalism which once advocated separatism and was on the fringes of protestantism became part of mainstream christianity works about mcphersonedit books

little difficulty with acceptance or attendance eager converts filled the pews of local churches which turned many recalcitrant ministers into her enthusiastic supporters frequently she would start a revival meeting in a hall or church and then have to move to a larger building to accommodate the growing crowds when no buildings were suitable she set up a tent which was often filled past capacity she wanted to create the enthusiasm a pentecostal meeting could provide with its amen corner and halleluiah chorus but also to avoid its unbridled chaos as participants started shouting trembling on the floor and speaking in tongues all at once mcpherson organized her meetings with the general public in mind and yet did not wish to quench any who suddenly came into the spirit to this she set up a tarry tent or room away from the general area for any who suddenly started speaking in tongues or display any other holy ghost behavior by which the larger audience might be put off in  mcpherson embarked on a tour of the southern united states in her gospel car and again later in  with her mother mildred kennedy mildred was an important addition to mcphersons ministry and managed everything including the money which gave them an unprecedented degree of financial security their vehicle was a  packard touring car emblazoned with religious slogans standing on the back seat of the convertible mcpherson preached sermons over a megaphone on the road between sermons she would sit in the back seat typing sermons and other religious materials she first traveled up and down the eastern united states then went to other parts of the country by  she had started her own magazine the bridal call for which she wrote many articles about women’s roles in religion she portrayed the link between christians and jesus as a marriage bond along with taking seriously the religious role of women the magazine contributed to transforming pentecostalism from a movement into an ongoing american religious presence  while mcpherson was traveling for her evangelical work she arrived in baltimore where she was first discovered by the newspapers in  after a day of conducting evangelistic services at the lyric opera house baltimore became one of the pivotal points for her early career the crowds in their religious ecstasy were barely kept under control as they gave way to manifestations of the spirit moreover her alleged faith healings now became part of the public record and attendees began to focus on that part of her ministry over all else mcpherson also considered the baltimore revival an important turning point not only for her ministry but in the history of the outpouring of the pentecostal power  career in los angelesedit in late  mcpherson came to los angeles a move many at the time were making for better opportunities minnie kennedy her mother rented the largest hall they could find the seat philharmonic auditorium known then as temple auditorium people waited for hours to get in and mcpherson could hardly reach the pulpit without stepping on someone afterwards grateful attendees of her los angeles meetings built a home for her family and her which included everything from the cellar to a canary bird at this time los angeles had become a popular vacation spot rather than touring the united states to preach her sermons mcpherson stayed in los angeles drawing audiences from a population which had soared from  in  to  people in  and often included many visitors wearied by constant traveling and having nowhere to raise a family mcpherson had settled in los angeles where she maintained both a home and a church mcpherson believed that by creating a church in los angeles her audience would come to her from all over the country this she felt would allow her to plant seeds of the gospel and tourists would take it home to their communities still reaching the masses for several years she continued to travel and raise money for the construction of a large domed church building at  glendale blvd in the echo park area of los angeles the church would be named angelus temple reflecting the roman catholic tradition of the angelus bell calling the faithful to prayer as well its reference to the angels not wanting to take on debt mcpherson located a construction firm which would work with her as funds were raised by faith she started with  the firm indicated it would be enough to carve out a hole for the foundation mcpherson began a campaign in earnest and was able to mobilize diverse groups of people to help fund and build the new church various fundraising methods were used such as selling chairs for temple seating at us  apiece in exchange chairholders got a miniature chair and encouragement to pray daily for the person who would eventually sit in that chair her approach worked to generate enthusiastic giving and to create a sense of ownership and family among the contributors raising more money than she had hoped mcpherson altered the original plans and built a megachurch that would draw many followers throughout the years the endeavor cost contributors around  in actual money spent however this price was low for a structure of its size costs were kept down by donations of building materials and volunteer labor mcpherson sometimes quipped when she first got to california all she had was a car ten dollars and a tambourine enrollment grew exceeding  and was advertised to be the largest single christian congregation in the world according to church records angelus temple received  million visitors within the first seven years mcpherson intended the angelus temple as both a place of worship and an ecumenical center for persons of all christian faiths to meet and build alliances a wide range of clergy and laypeople consisted of methodists baptists the salvation army presbyterians episcopalians adventists quakers roman catholics mormons and even secular civic leaders who came to the angelus temple they were welcomed and many made their way to her podium as guest speakers eventually even rev robert p shuler a oncerobust mcpherson critic was featured as a guest preacher because pentecostalism was not popular in the united states during the s mcpherson avoided the label she practiced speakingintongues and faith healing within her services but kept the former to a minimum in sermons to appease mainstream audiences discarded medical fittings from persons faithhealed during her services which included crutches wheelchairs and other paraphernalia were gathered for display in a museum area as evidence of her early influence by the salvation army mcpherson adopted a theme of lighthouses for the satellite churches referring to the parent church as the salvation navy this was the beginning of mcpherson working to plant foursquare gospel churches around the country charitable workedit mcpherson left prepares christmas food baskets about  mcpherson strove to develop a church organization which could not only provide for the spiritual but also the physical needs of the distressed though she fervently believed and preached the imminent return of jesus christ she had no idea of how soon that second coming might be two thoughts pervaded the mind of most devout pentecostals of the time jesus is coming therefore how can i get ready and how can i help others to get ready for mcpherson part of the answer was to mobilize her temple congregation and everyone she could reach through radio telephone and word of mouth to get involved in substantial amounts of charity and social work true christianity is not only to be good but to do good she preached the charities and beneficiary department collected donations for all types of humanitarian relief to include a japanese disaster as well as a german relief fund men released from prison were found jobs by a brotherhood a sisterhood was created as well sewing baby clothing for impoverished mothers branch churches elsewhere in the country were likewise encouraged to follow the angelus temples example even people who considered mcphersons theology almost ridiculous helped out because they saw her church as the best way to assist their community in june  after confirming reports of an earthquake in santa barbara mcpherson immediately left the parsonage and interrupted a broadcast at a nearby radio station she took over the microphone from the startled singer and requested food blankets clothing or whatever listeners could give for emergency supplies to assist nearby santa barbara as the red cross met to discuss and organize aid mcphersons second convoy had already arrived at the troubled city in  after a dam failed and the ensuing flood left up to  dead in its wake mcphersons church led the relief effort later in  an earthquake struck and devastated long beach mcpherson quickly arranged for volunteers to be on the scene with blankets coffee and doughnuts men wait in line to enter aimee semple mcphersons angelus temple free dining hall  commissary located at  w temple street at the time she was married to david hutton and all branding reflected his last name drawing from her childhood experience with the salvation army in  mcpherson opened a commissary at angelus temple which was devised to assist the needy on a much larger formalized scale the commissary was virtually the only place in town a person could get food clothing and blankets with no questions asked it was open  hours a day seven days a week and became active in creating soup kitchens free clinics and other charitable activities as the great depression wore on she fed an estimated  million people when the government shut down the free schoollunch program mcpherson took it over her policy of giving first and investigating afterward allowed waste and a certain number of deadbeats to leech off the program but it alleviated suffering on an epic scale mcpherson got the fire and police departments to assist in distribution doctors physicians and dentists were persuaded to staff her free clinic that trained  nurses to help treat children and the elderly she encouraged individuals and companies of all types to donate supplies food cash or labor to prevent the power from being turned off to homes of overdue accounts during the winter a  cash reserve was set up with the utility company many people who otherwise would have nothing to do with the angelus temple would receive a call from mcpherson and then loot their mansion closets or company stores for something to give the yellow cab company donated a large building and in the first month  people received meals there laboring under a sign everybody and anybody is somebody to jesus volunteer workers filled commissary baskets with an assortment of food and other items as well as foursquare gospel literature and handed them out even a complete kit designed to care for newborn babies was available a reporter wrote he had always thought the breadline was a drab colorless scar on our civilization but of the angelus temple commissary he observed was the warm garment of sympathy and christian succor a note which reflects the sentiment of many of those who received assistance was left in june  at mcphersons virtual gravesite my grandpa always talked about when he was a kid he and his family moved to california from missouri during the depression and his family was starving and they met you and you gave them a bag of vegetables and some money he never forgot it anonymous establishing an employment bureau as well mcpherson desired to help the discouraged husband the despondent widow or the little mother who wants extra work to bear the burden of a sick husband she expected everyone in her temple to be involved let us ever strive to lighten our brothers load and dry the tears of a sister race creed or status make no difference we are all one in the eyes of the lord she encouraged members to think of the commissary as widening the spirituality of the whole church line of unemployed men getting meals at dining hall run by aimee semple mcpherson  in  the commissary was raided by police to allegedly locate a still used to make brandy out of donated apricots some sauerkraut and salad oil were purportedly observed leaking from their respective storage areas as a consequence the commissary was briefly shut down the press got involved and the public demanded an investigation since no one really wanted to stall the temples charity efforts the acceptable solution was to replace the immediate management the staff was let go and students from her foursquare gospel churchs life bible college filled in the newspaper media generally cynical of the temple and in particular of mcpherson recognized the excellent features of that organizations efforts and the faults of the angelus temple are outweighed by its virtues mcpherson issued a statement declaring they have clashed loud their cymbals and blown their trumpets about a still and some sauerkraut our work is still before us ifanybody abused his trust it must not happen again as mcpherson tried to avoid administrative delays in categorizing the deserving from the undeserving her temple commissary became known as one of the regions most effective and inclusive aid institutions few soup kitchens lasted more than several months but mcphersons remained open even as she transformed herself into a fashionable blonde hollywood socialite mcphersons vigor and practicality for social activism did not change she loved organizing big projects a  survey indicated the angelus temple assisted more family units than any other public or private institution in the city because her programs aided nonresidents as well such as migrants from other states and mexico she ran afoul of california state regulations though temple guidelines were later officially adjusted to accommodate those policies helping families in need was a priority regardless of their place of residence actor anthony quinn recalls this was all during the height of the depression when hunger and poverty permeated america many mexicans were terrified of appealing for county help because most of them were in the country illegally when in distress they were comforted by the fact that they could call one of aimees branches at any time of the night there they would never be asked any of the embarrassing questions posed by the authorities the fact that they were hungry or in need of warm clothing was enough no one even asked if they belonged to aimees church or not ministryedit style of ministryedit in august  and away from los angeles mcpherson decided to charter a plane so she would not miss giving her sunday sermon aware of the opportunity for publicity she arranged for at least  followers and members of the press to be present at the airport the plane failed after takeoff and the landing gear collapsed sending the nose of the plane into the ground mcpherson boarded another plane and used the experience as the narrative of an illustrated sunday sermon called the heavenly airplane the stage in angelus temple was set up with two miniature planes and a skyline that looked like los angeles in this sermon mcpherson described how the first plane had the devil for the pilot sin for the engine and temptation as the propeller the other plane however was piloted by jesus and would lead one to the holy city the skyline shown on stage the temple was filled beyond capacity angelus temple completed in  is the center of the international church of the foursquare gospel founded by mcpherson in  angelus temple was designated a national historic landmark it is still in active use on another occasion she described being pulled over by a police officer calling the sermon arrested for speeding dressed in a traffic cops uniform she sat in the saddle of a police motorcycle earlier placed on the stage and revved the siren one author in attendance insisted she actually drove the motorcycle with its deafening roar across the access ramp to the pulpit slammed on the brakes then raised a whitegloved hand to shout stop youre speeding to hell since mcpherson gave some of her sermons more than once and with variations the possibility existed both versions might be true mcpherson employed a small group of artists electricians decorators and carpenters who built the sets for each sundays service religious music was played by an orchestra mcpherson also worked on elaborate sacred operas one production the iron furnace based on the book of exodus told of god’s deliverance as the israelites fled slavery in egypt some hollywood movie stars even assisted with obtaining costumes from local studios the cast was large perhaps as many as  people but so elaborate and expensive it was presented only one time rehearsals for the various productions were timeconsuming and mcpherson did not tolerate any nonsense though described as always kind and loving mcpherson demanded respect regarding the divine message the sacred operas and her other works were designed to convey aimee semple mcpherson surrounded by massed choirs at angelus temple for a musical requiem in  even though mcpherson condemned theater and film as the devils workshop its secrets and effects were coopted she became the first woman evangelist to adopt the whole technique of the moving picture star mcpherson desired to avoid the dreary church service where by obligation parishioners would go to fulfill some duty by being present in the pew she wanted a sacred drama that would compete with the excitement of vaudeville and the movies the message was serious but the tone more along the lines of a humorous musical comedy animals were frequently incorporated and mcpherson the once farm girl knew how to handle them mcpherson gave up to  sermons a week and the lavish sunday night service attracted the largest crowds extra trolleys and police were needed to help route the traffic through echo park to and from angelus temple to finance the angelus temple and its projects collections were taken at every meeting often with the admonishment no coins please mcpherson preached a conservative gospel but used progressive methods taking advantage of radio movies and stage acts advocacy for womens rights was on the rise including womens suffrage through the th amendment she attracted some women associated with modernism but others were put off by the contrast between her different theories by accepting and using such new media outlets mcpherson helped integrate them into people’s daily lives sister mcpherson used the media to her advantage as she became the first modern celebrity preacher minister aimee semple mcpherson and a group of tambourine players leading a service at angelus temple she was very innovative in producing weekly dramas illustrating religious themes the battle between fundamentalists and modernists escalated after world war i with many modernists seeking less conservative religious faiths fundamentalists generally believed their religious faith should influence every aspect of their lives mcpherson sought to eradicate modernism and secularism in homes churches schools and communities she developed a strong following in what mcpherson termed the foursquare gospel by blending contemporary culture with religious teachings mcpherson was entirely capable of sustaining a protracted intellectual discourse as her bible students and debate opponents will attest but she believed in preaching the gospel with simplicity and power so as to not confuse the message her distinct voice and visual descriptions created a crowd excitement bordering on hysteria the appeal of mcphersons  or so revival events from  to  surpassed any touring event of theater or politics ever presented in american history neither houdini nor teddy roosevelt had such an audience nor pt barnum her one to fourweek meetings typically overflowed any building she could find to hold them she broke attendance records recently set by billy sunday and frequently used his temporary tabernacle structures in which to hold some of her meetings her revivals were often standingroom only one such revival was held in a boxing ring with the meeting before and after the match throughout the boxing event she walked about with a sign reading knock out the devil in san diego california the city called in the national guard and other branches of the armed forces to control a revival crowd over  people she became one of the most photographed persons of her time she enjoyed the publicity and quotes on almost every subject were sought from her by journalists faith healing ministryedit main article faith healing ministry of aimee semple mcpherson mcphersons ability to draw crowds was also greatly assisted by her apparently successful faith healing presentations almost by accident she discovered when she laid hands on sick or injured persons they got well one early mcpherson biographer nancy barr mavity described the healing power beyond her conscience sic control and profoundly troubling however a phenomenon familiar to the psychiatrist although none the less sic mysterious  during a  revival meeting in corona long island new york a young woman in the advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis was brought to the altar by friends mcpherson would have preferred to pray with her privately however the woman insisted upon immediate prayer mcpherson laid hands on her and prayed before the gathered parishioners the woman walked out of the church without crutches mcphersons reputation as a faith healer rapidly became known and the sick and injured people came to her by the tens of thousands the faith healing ministry of aimee semple mcpherson was extensively written about in the news media and was a large part of her early career legacy no one has ever been credited by secular witnesses with anywhere near the numbers of faith healings attributed to mcpherson especially during the years  to  over time though she almost withdrew from the faithhealing aspect of her services since it was overwhelming other areas of her ministry scheduled weekly and monthly healing sessions nevertheless remained highly popular with the public until her death in  the foursquare churchedit foursquare church logo eventually mcphersons church evolved into its own denomination and became known as the international church of the foursquare gospel usually referenced as the foursquare church foursquare is an alternative word for full gospel a term used by pentecostals referencing the nature of christs character that he was savior baptizer with the holy spirit healer and sooncoming king the four main beliefs were the first being christs ability to transform individuals lives through the act of salvation the second focused on a holy baptism which includes receiving power to glorify and exalt christ in a practical way the third was divine healing newness of life for both body and spirit and the fourth was gospeloriented heed to the premillennial return of jesus christ mcpherson published the weekly foursquare crusader along with her monthly magazine bridal call she began broadcasting on radio in the early s on a sunday morning in april  the rockridge radio station in oakland ca offered her some radio time and she became the first woman to preach a sermon over the wireless telephone with the opening of foursquare gospelowned kfsg on february   she became the second woman granted a broadcast license by the department of commerce the federal agency that supervised broadcasting in the early s mcpherson racially integrated her tent meetings and church services on one occasion as a response to mcphersons ministry and angelus temple being integrated ku klux klan members were in attendance but after the service hoods and robes were found on the ground in nearby echo park she is also credited with helping many hispanic ministries in los angeles mcpherson traveling about the country holding widely popular revival meetings and filling local churches with converts was one thing settling permanently into their city caused concern among some local los angeles churches though she shared many of their fundamentalist beliefs such as divine inspiration of the bible the classical trinity virgin birth of jesus historical reality of christs miracles bodily resurrection of christ and the atoning purpose of his crucifixion the presentation of lavish sermons and an effective faithhealing ministry presented by a female divorcee whom thousands adored and about whom newspapers continuously wrote was unexpected moreover the temple especially the women had a look and style uniquely theirs they would emulate mcphersons style and dress and a distinct angelus temple uniform came into existence a white dress with a navy blue cape thrown over it men were more discreet wearing suits her voice projected over the powerful stateoftheart kfsg radio station and heard by hundreds of thousands became the most recognized in the western united states mcpherson preaching at the newly built angelus temple in  her messages showcased the love of god redemption and the joys of service and heaven contrasting sharply with the fireandbrimstone style of sermon delivery popular with many of her peers her illustrated sermons attracted criticism from some clergy members because they thought it turned the gospel message into mundane theater and entertainment divine healing as mcpherson called it was claimed by many pastors to be a unique dispensation granted only for apostolic times rival radio evangelist reverend robert p shuler published a pamphlet entitled mcphersonism which purported that her most spectacular and advertised program was out of harmony with gods word debates such as the bogardmcpherson debate in  drew further attention to the controversy but none could really argue effectively against mcphersons results the new developing assemblies of god denomination pentecostal as mcpherson was for a time worked with her but they encouraged separation from established protestant faiths mcpherson resisted trends to isolate as a denomination and continued her task of coalitionbuilding among evangelicals mcpherson worked hard to attain ecumenical vision of the faith and while she participated in debates avoided pitched rhetorical battles that divided so many in christianity she wanted to work with existing churches on projects and to share with them her visions and beliefs assisting in her passion was the speedy establishment of life bible college adjacent to the angeles temple ministers trained there were originally intended to go nationally and worldwide to all denominations and share her newly defined foursquare gospel a wellknown methodist minister frank thompson who never had the pentecostal experience was persuaded to run the college and he taught the students the doctrine of john wesley mcpherson and others meanwhile infused them with pentecostal ideals for about a year antonia frederick futterer suggested by los angeles times as the inspiration for steven spielbergs film character indiana jones was also a facility member mcphersons efforts eventually led pentecostals which were previously unconventional and on the periphery of christianity into the mainstream of american evangelicalism life in the media spotlightedit media relationsedit by early  mcpherson had become one of the most charismatic and influential women and ministers of her time her fame equaled to name a few charles lindbergh johnny weissmuller jack dempsey babe ruth ty cobb knute rockne bobby jones louise brooks and rudolph valentino she was a major american phenomenon who along with some other highprofile preachers of the time unlike hollywood celebrities could be admired by their adoring public without apparently compromising their souls according to carey mcwilliams she had become more than just a household word she was a folk hero and a civic institution an honorary member of the fire and police departments a patron saint of the service clubs an official spokesman for the community on problems grave and frivolous she was influential in many social educational and political areas mcpherson made personal crusades against anything that she felt threatened her christian ideals including the drinking of alcohol and teaching evolution in schools mcpherson became a strong supporter of william jennings bryan during the  scopes trial in which john scopes was tried for illegally teaching evolution at a dayton tennessee school bryan and mcpherson had worked together in the angelus temple and they believed darwinism had undermined students morality according to the new yorker mcpherson said evolution is the greatest triumph of satanic intelligence in  years of devilish warfare against the hosts of heaven it is poisoning the minds of the children of the nation she sent bryan a telegram saying ten thousand members of angelus temple with her millions of radio church membership send grateful appreciation of your lionhearted championship of the bible against evolution and throw our hats in the ring with you she organized an allnight prayer service a massive church meeting preceded by a bible parade through los angeles politicsedit while her mother mildred kennedy was a registered democrat no one was certain of mcphersons registration she endorsed herbert hoover over franklin d roosevelt but enthusiastically threw her support behind the latter and his social programs when he was elected into office she was a patron of organized labor preaching a gangsters money was no more unclean than the dollars of the man who amasses his millions from underpaid factory workers she was more cautious though when labor strikes resulted in violent uprisings she saw in them the possible activities of communism which sought to infiltrate labor unions and other organizations mcpherson intensely disliked communism and its derivatives as they sought to rule without god their ultimate goal she believed was to remove christianity from the earth mcphersons opinion of fascism fared no better its totalitarian rule was wrongly justified by claiming to represent the power of god mcpherson did not align herself consistently with any broad conservative or liberal political agenda instead she explained if christianity occupied a central place in national life and if the components of god home school and government were kept together everything else would fall into place remove any of these she warned and civilization topples crumbles current foursquare gospel church leaders qualify the evangelists views mcpherson’s passion to see america sustained in spiritual health which compelled her quest to see the church influence government must be interpreted in light of the political and religious climate of the s s and s it is not accurate to draw a parallel between today’s extreme fundamentalist rightwing christianity and the style or focus of sister mcpherson she was also among the first prominent christian ministers to defend the establishment of a jewish homeland in palestine she related that when christ returns the jews would receive him their suffering will end and they will establish at jerusalem a kingdom more wonderful than the world has known reported kidnappingedit disappearance from venice beachedit main article reported kidnapping of aimee semple mcpherson minnie

venice beach to swim soon after arriving mcpherson was nowhere to be found it was thought she had drowned searchers combed the beach and nearby area but could not locate her body the angelus temple received letters and calls claiming knowledge of mcpherson including demands for ransom mcpherson sightings occurred around the country often in widely divergent locations many miles apart on the same day as a precaution the ransom notes were sent to the police who investigated at least one of them mildred kennedy though regarded the messages as hoaxes believing her daughter dead as the angelus temple prepared for a memorial service commemorating mcphersons death kennedy received a phone call from douglas arizona her daughter was alive the distraught mcpherson was resting in a douglas

held against her face causing her to pass out eventually she was moved to an adobe shack far in the desert two kidnappers steve and rose were her constant companions with a third unnamed man occasionally visiting when at last all her captors were away on errands she escaped out a window using a mountain as a landmark she traveled through the desert for around – hours across an estimated distance of  miles  km around  am she reached agua prieta sonora a mexican border town and collapsed near a house there she was assisted by the residents and finally taken to adjacent douglas return to los angelesedit after leaving douglas mcpherson was greeted at the los angeles train station by – people more than for almost any other personage the parade back to the temple even elicited a greater turnout than president woodrow wilsons visit to los angeles in  attesting to her popularity and the growing influence of mass media entertainment already incensed over mcphersons influential public stance on evolution and the bible most of the chamber of commerce and some other civic leaders saw the event as gaudy display nationally embarrassing to the city many los angeles area churches were also annoyed the story received nationwide coverage then speculations together with alleged witnesses began to emerge that her disappearance might have been caused by other than the kidnapping event mcpherson described against the wishes of her mother who thought the press would continue to unfavorably exploit the story mcpherson decided for vindication and presented her complaint in court a grand jury inquiry convened to determine if enough evidence could be found to indict any kidnappers however pressured by various influential community groups the court instead intensely investigated mcpherson her family and acquaintances to determine if the kidnapping was fabricated district attorney asa keyes led the prosecution against her he was known for winning convictions but six persons he sent to prison were found to be innocent and pardoned by the state governor grand jury inquiryedit the grand jury inquiries were first convened on july   adjourned and reconvened holding sessions through the summer of  accompanied by intense media interest the proceedings were supposed to be secret as per california law though the los angeles court spoke about it to the newspapers issues of trial by media and court of public opinion were apparent as much of the proclaimed evidence against mcpherson came from reporters who featured it in their news articles and passed it on to the police mcpherson also eschewed secrecy and freely used her radio station to broadcast her side of the story evidence and testimonies were hotly debated by an evenly divided public on november  the case was determined to be moved to jury trial set for midjanuary  along with mcpherson and her mother several other defendants were charged in the inquiry if convicted the counts added up to maximum prison time of  years various speculations were proffered by the news media and prosecution as to the reason for mcphersons disappearance the one they settled on most strongly was she ran off with an exemployee kenneth ormiston she was accused of staying with him in a california resort town cottage until may  the time frame of ormistons seaside cottage rental coincided with the first  days of her disappearance however a missing threeweek period afterwards was not accounted for with any evidence in court by the prosecution in response the evangelist maintained all along without changing anything in her story that she was taken held captive by the kidnappers and escaped as she originally described as the prosecution tried to break down her story defense witnesses corroborated her assertions  or mcpherson herself demonstrated how the disputed parts were plausible in contrast the prosecutions case developed serious credibility issues witnesses changed their testimonies and evidence often had suspicious origins or was mishandled while in custody finally on january   ormiston identified elizabeth tovey a nurse from seattle washington as his female companion and the woman who stayed with him at the seaside cottage all charges against mcpherson and associated parties were dropped by the court for the lack of evidence on january   after the case dismissaledit regardless of the courts decision months of unfavorable press reports fixed in much of the publics mind a certainty of mcphersons wrongdoing the newspapers had a vested interest in keeping the controversy going since it generated huge sales the bulk of the investigation against mcpherson was funded by los angelesarea newspapers at an estimated amount of  some supporters thought mcpherson should have insisted on the jury trial and clear her name the grand jury inquiry concluded while enough evidence did not exist to try her it did not indicate her story was true with its implication of kidnappers still at large court costs to mcpherson were estimated to be as high as  a jury trial could take months mcpherson moved on to other projects in  she published a book about her version of the kidnapping in the service of the king the story of my life various influential individuals offered their opinions on the inquiry in a letter to the los angeles times a few months after the case was dropped the reverend robert p shuler stated perhaps the most serious thing about this whole situation is the seeming loyalty of thousands to this leader in the face of her evident and positively proven guilt hl mencken noted journalist satirist cultural critic and scholar and an ideological opponent of mcpherson opposite each other in the  scopes monkey trial also commented he wrote that since many of that towns residents acquired their ideas of the true the good and the beautiful from the movies and newspapers los angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her claims of extramarital affairsedit during her lifetimeedit numerous allegations of illicit love affairs were often directed against mcpherson suspected lovers generally denied involvement for example kenneth ormiston a married man with a small son could have profited immensely from an exposé about himself and mcpherson whether the two had a good working relationship and were friendly with each other was not disputed during the  kidnapping grand jury trial reporters and investigators tried to link him amorously to mcpherson ormiston told newspapers his name connected in such a way to the evangelist was a gross insult to a noble and sincere woman mcpherson was often the target of numerous unsubstantiated sexually related allegations as reported by the los angeles times june   this photograph depicts the evangelist reading a note demanding  else nude motion pictures of her and a friend would be publicly released when inquired about it in an unrelated interview later that year she tersely stated nude pictures of her did not exist because none were ever taken alarmed by her rapidly changing style of dress and involvement with hollywood and its worldly lifestyle in  an angelus temple official hired detectives to shadow mcpherson through her windows the detectives frequently saw mcpherson staying up until the early morning hours composing songs drafting sacred operas and scribbling diagrams of her illustrated sermons they were looking for evidence of her indiscretions but found nothing no confirmation of adulterous misconduct with perhaps exception of her third marriage as a violation of church tenets was ever presented mcpherson herself aware of numerous accusations leveled at her throughout her career responded only to a small fraction of them conveying the only thing she had time for was preaching jesus posthumouslyedit posthumously unsubstantiated allegations of extramarital affairs continued to emerge this time by those who stated to have been her partner claims not mentioned by them or others while she was still alive canadian journalist gordon sinclair implied such a claim in his  autobiography will the real gordon sinclair please stand up sinclair stated he worked on a story with mcpherson and during one of those times in  the incident purportedly occurred sinclair alluded to a sexual dalliance with mcpherson one afternoon along with some gin and ginger thirty years after her death another claim by comedian milton berle in a  autobiography alleges a brief affair with the evangelist in his book titled milton berle an autobiography berle asserts he met mcpherson at the shrine auditorium in los angeles where both were doing a charity show biographer matthew avery sutton commented berle a notorious womanizer whose many tales of scandalous affairs were not always true claimed to have had sex with mcpherson on this and one other occasion both during a year when mcpherson was often ill and bedridden sutton noted that berles story of a crucifix in mcphersons bedroom was not consistent with the coolness of pentecostalcatholic relations during that era another book by milton berle laughingly yours which had autobiographical content that was published in  while mcpherson was still alive did not have this claim author raymond l cox states mrs mcphersons daughter roberta salter of new york told me mother never had an apartment in her life by  she kept herself securely chaperoned to guard against such allegations during  the evangelists appearances and whereabouts can be traced almost every day she was incapacitated with illness a full five months of that year and there is no place on her schedule as reported in her publications and church and travel records for the benefit berle alleged besides roberta also told cox mother never did a benefit in her life she had her own charities later life and careeredit mcpherson surrounded by flowers cutting into angelus temple cake  not one for settling into a predictable routine she used her birthday national holidays and other events as themes for church services and gala festivities after fallout with pressedit following her heyday in the s mcpherson carried on with her ministry but fell out of favor with the press they once dubbed her the miracle worker or miracle woman reporting extensively on her faithhealing demonstrations but now were anxious to relay every disturbance in her household to the headlines her developing difficulties with her mother mildred kennedy were starting to take the front page yet mcpherson emerged from the kidnapping nationally famous as much as  of the population in los angeles held membership in her temple for a time movie studios competed with each other offering mcpherson longterm contracts believing that talking pictures had the potential to transform christianity mcpherson explored hollywood culture and appeared in newsreels alongside other famous individuals such as mary pickford frances perkins and franklin d roosevelt she lost weight cut and dyed her hair began to wear makeup and jewelry and became stylish and wellattired a critic wrote mcpherson can outdress the hollywood stars the solicitation of fame justified to draw audiences to her and hence to christ was more than some in her church organization could accept they yearned for sister aimee in the old time dress referring to her previous trademarked uniform of a navy cape over a white servants dress both purchased inexpensively in bargain basements other members though loved it and her angelus temple services were as popular as ever and remained so throughout her life unless parishioners arrived to a service early frequently they could not get in all seats were taken now that she could afford it mcpherson thought as well she wanted her apparel and display to be the best she could present to jesus in early  mcpherson immediately set out on a vindication tour visiting various cities and taking advantage of the publicity her kidnapping story created to preach the gospel her visit to new york in foxfurs and a finely trimmed yellow suit was noted in the society pages she visited even nightclubs to include a famous speakeasy in new york texas guinan’s three hundred club on th street while mcpherson sipped water at her table guinan asked if she would speak a few words to the patrons delighted mcpherson stood and addressed the jazzed and boozy crowd behind all these beautiful clothes behind these good times in the midst of your lovely buildings and shops and pleasures there is another life there is something on the other side “what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul” with all your getting and playing and good times do not forget you have a lord take him into your hearts the unexpected speech that did not judge and had a conciliatory tone between them and the divine earned a thoughtful moment of silence from the crowd then an applause that went on for much longer than the speech took the revelers were invited to hear her preach at the glad tidings tabernacle on rd street the visits to speakeasies and nightclubs added to mcphersons notoriety newspapers reported heavily on them rumors erroneously conveyed she was drinking smoking and dancing and her mother along with some other church members did not understand mcphersons strategy of tearing down barriers between the secular and religious world between the sinner and the saved problems with mildred kennedyedit without mildred kennedys conservative financial management replacement administrators embarked on a spread of ambitious projects that often failed an example of this was lake tahoe lot deals of which the cover of an alleged prospectus describes not enough parcels of land were purchased and the subsequent lawsuit brought by investors drew unfavorable publicity and the attention of the district attorneys office in the summer of  mildred kennedy mcphersons mother left the angelus temple in an attempt to curtail her daughters influence and officially transfer more power to herself kennedy initiated a staffmember vote of confidence against mcpherson but lost the two had heatedly argued over management polices and mcphersons changing personal dress and appearance for similar reasons  members of the choir left as well the choir could be replaced however kennedys financial and administrative skills had been of crucial importance in growing mcphersons ministry from tent revivals to satellite churches and maintaining its current activities in the temple a series of less able management staff replaced kennedy and the temple became involved in various questionable projects such as hotel building cemetery plots and land sales accordingly the angelus temple plummeted deep into debt in response to the difficulties kennedy came back in late  but because of continued serious disagreements with mcpherson tendered her resignation on july   the following month mcpherson suffered a physical and nervous breakdown for  months she was absent from the pulpit diagnosed in part with acute acidosis resurrecting her careeredit when she gained strength and returned she introduced with renewed vigor her moving attar of roses sermon based on the song of solomon with its rose of sharon as the mystical body of christ while journalists attending her sunday illustrated sermons assumed her language was fit only for slapstick or sentimental entertainment scholars who have studied her work for bible students and small prayer groups found instead the complex discourse of neoplatonic interpretation the old testament book the song of solomon for example she had hundreds of pages written about it each different from one another as snowflakes the october –  revival in boston started out sluggishly and many predicted its failure a los angeles newspaper ran headlines of the flop and expected more of the same in the days to come on opening night mcpherson spoke to fewer than  persons in the seat sports arena and safety pins and rubber bands abundantly cluttered the collection baskets the city had large populations of unitarians episcopalians and catholics venerable denominations traditionally hostile to a pentecostal or fundamentalist message afterwards from her hotel room mcpherson known to be a sports fan asked for the afternoons world series scores and a boston herald reporter sent her a copy of the sunday edition the next day the bring back the bible to boston campaigns tone shifted as mcpherson took greater control and attendance climbed sharply a reporter took note of mcphersons stage presence different from any other evangelist who spoke there gesturing with her white bible for effect as well as preaching answering him as to why she presented a dramatic sermon she stated our god is a dramatic god rolling back the red sea elijah on the mountaintop the crucifixion the resurrection his ascension tongues of fire on the day of pentecost the final day of afternoon and evening services had  persons attending the stadium was full and more than  had to be turned away a total of  people attended the meetings breaking historic attendance records of any nine days of revival services in boston her revival in new york city was not very fruitful as her sensationalistic reputation preceded her the third marriage to david hutton rumored romances and her kidnapping was what its press and citizens wanted to hear about therefore after a brief pause in new york and washington dc she went on philadelphia and other cities traveling to  of them in  states speaking to as much as  of the entire population of the united states a full crew of musicians scene designers and costumers accompanied mcpherson in this her last national revival tour between september  and december   two million persons heard  sermons many more were reached by  radio stations the boston evening traveler newspaper reported aimees religion is a religion of joy there is happiness in it her voice is easy to listen to she does not appeal to the brain and try to hammer religion into the heads of her audience rather she appeals to the hearts of her hearers she radiates friendliness she creates an atmosphere that is warming she is persuasive rather than forceful gracious and kindly rather than compelling fundamentally she takes the whole bible literally from cover to cover nevertheless she was not a radical literalist in an informal meeting with some harvard students mcpherson told them that genesis allowed great latitude of interpretation and that neither she nor the bible insisted the world was created only  years ago in another meeting with students she heard their assertion the teachings of christ have outlived their usefulness education science and cold reasoning were the new saviors of the world thus compelled mcpherson decided to travel and look at the world with new eyes in  mcpherson embarked on a worldwide sixmonth discovery tour to examine the social religious and economic climates of many countries at one point it was earlier reported she wanted to study the womens movement in connection with the campaign for the independence of india and was anxious to have a chat with mahatma gandhi she received an invitation from him and he gave her a sari made from threads woven from his simple spinning wheel impressed with gandhi and his ideas mcpherson thought he might secretly lean towards christianity his dedication possibly coming from catching a glimpse of the cleansing lifting strengthening power of the nazarene other highlights included traversing barefoot in myanmar the lengthy stone path to the great pagoda a goldcovered ft tiered tower enshrining relics of four buddhas which caught and reflected the rays of the sun a vision of breathtaking glory she heard benito mussolini speak in italy and fretted war would again ensue in the rain at verdun france she sat on a wrecked military vehicle in mournful contemplation of the hundreds of thousands who died on the stilluncleared battlefield white bleached bones of the fallen poked out of the earth and nearby laborers toiled carefully at their dangerous iron harvest collecting old munitions for disposal in mid a delegation who had been involved with the  azusa street mission revivals including emma cotton asked if they could use the angelus temple for their th anniversary celebration the original mission building was demolished and its land unavailable african american evangelist emma cotton and mcpherson therefore organized a series of meetings which also marked her enthusiastic reidentification with the pentecostal movement mcphersons experiments of hollywood celebrity ambitions coexisting with her ministry were not as successful as she hoped alliances with other church groups were failing or no longer in effect and she searched for ways to start again therefore she looked to her spiritual origins and allowed for the possibility of reintroducing even the more alarming aspects of the pentecostal experience into her public meetings temple officials were concerned the azusa people might bring in some wildfire and holy rollerism mcpherson indicated she would turn hand springs with them as needed to see the power of god manifest the azusa street revival commemoration events brought numbers of black leaders to her pulpit the original attendees of the azusa revivals filled the angelus temple along with every ethnic minority the saints who were once smelted together with the fires of pentecost were being reunited rewelded and rejuvenated mcpherson recommitted herself to the dissemination of classic pentecostalism and her concern now was that foursquaredom was in the danger of becoming too churchy for the first time since the temple opened mcpherson began to publicly deliver some of her messages in tongues mcpherson traversed the line between cold formality and wildfire and now decided it was easier to cool down a hot fanatic than to resuscitate a corpse future meetings to celebrate the azusa street revivals included guest charles h mason a founder of the churches of god in christ mason an azusa leader was also one of the most significant african american religious figures in united states history and was frequently hosted at the angelus temple roberta star semple left mcphersons daughter aimee semplemcpherson middle and rheba crawford splivalo assistant pastorright at a parade in  problems with the templeedit also in  mcpherson reassigned staff responsibilities in an effort to address the temples financial difficulties this together with other unresolved issues accelerated simmering tensions among various staff members rumors circulated that angel of broadway charismatic evangelist rheba crawford splivalo who had been working extensively with mcpherson for several years planned to take the angelus temple from her mcpherson asked splivalo to leave town in the course of the staff controversy mcphersons lawyer issued a strongly worded press release that upset roberta star semple mcphersons daughter and led her to initiate a  lawsuit against him for slander splivalo also sued mcpherson for  because of alleged statements calling her a ‘jezebel and a judas’ and unfit to stand in the angelus temple pulpit the two lawsuits filed by semple and splivalo were not related but mcpherson did not see it that way she saw both as part of the temple takeover plot mcphersons mother was also involved and sided with semple her granddaughter making unflattering statements about mcpherson to the press in these charged circumstances mcphersons defense of herself and her lawyer in a public trial was dramatic and theatrical she testified tearfully with swoons and faints about how her daughter conspired with others against her her daughters lawyer meanwhile mocked mcpherson by imitating her mannerisms and making faces at her the trial did much to estrange mcpherson from her daughter the judge ruled for semple giving a  judgment in her favor semple then moved to new york splivalo and the temple settled their suit out of court for the cause of religion and the good of the community with kennedy semple and splivalo gone the temple lost much of its talented leadership however mcpherson found a competent and firm administrator in giles knight who was able to bring the temple out of debt dispose of the  or so lawsuits and eliminate the more spurious projects he sequestered mcpherson allowed her to receive only a few personal visitors and carefully regulated her activities outside the temple this period was one of unprecedented creativity for mcpherson no longer distracted by waves of reporters reams of lawsuits and innumerable individuals demanding her attention she became very accomplished in her illustrative sermon style of gospel preaching the irreligious charlie chaplin would secretly attend her services enjoying her sermons she later met and consulted with chaplin on ways to improve her presentations mcpherson who earlier blared across newspaper headlines as many as three times a week in one alleged scandal or another had her public image much improved her adversary reverend robert p shuler who previously attacked her by radio magazine pulpit and pamphlet proclaimed aimees missionary work was the envy of methodists he also expressed his support of her foursquare church application admittance into national association of evangelicals for united action in  her efforts at making interracial revival a reality at angelus temple continued she welcomed blacks into the congregation and pulpit while race riots burned detroit in  mcpherson publicly converted the notorious black former heavyweight champion jack johnson on the temple stage and embraced him “as he raised his hand in worship” war yearsedit views on waredit pacifism which was a component of pentecostalism was evaluated by the foursquare gospel church in the s with official statements and documents which were further revised by mcpherson a press quote attributed to mcpherson in reference to mahatma gandhi appears to explore the concept i want to incorporate the ideals of india with my own additionally clinton howard the chairman of the world peace commission was invited to speak at the angelus temple in  she promoted disarmament if the nations of the world would stop building warships and equipping armies we would be all but overwhelmed with prosperity foursquare leaders alarmed at rapid changes of technology especially sea and air which challenged the united states isolation and security decided to officially draw up an amendment inclusive of varied opinions in regards to military service the idea that one could trust to bear arms in a righteous cause as well as believing the killing of others even in connection to military service would endanger their souls both views were acceptable reaction to waredit mcpherson kept a canny eye on the international events leading up to the second world war citing the probability of a much more terrible conflict than the one that passed  years earlier in a sermon she described a recently conquered country which had the cross and other religious symbols in their schools removed in their place was a portrait of a certain man instead of prayer their school day began with a distinctive salute to this person the destructive apocalypse of john the apostle with its expected high civilian casualties followed by the second coming of christ it seemed was at hand even if submarines were hiding in the depths of the sea they could not escape the terror that would befall them congregation at angelus temple during hour holy ghost service led by aimee semple mcpherson los angeles calif  allnight prayer meetings were held friday nights at the angelus temple starting in  the year when germany was overrunning belgium the netherlands and france she asked other foursquare churches around the country to follow suit she sent president franklin roosevelts secretary mr stephen early as well as some other leaders an outline of her plans prayer to her was even more powerful than the implements of war various officials expressed their appreciation including the governor of california early passed on a reply back from roosevelt a message of thanks for her work a month later roosevelt declared a national day of prayer to beseech the ruler of the universe to bless our republic foursquare leaders thought mcpherson may have inspired it and perhaps the president of the united states was looking to her for spiritual leadership of the nation at the outbreak of world war ii mcpherson rejected the christian pacifism of many in the pentecostal movement including those of her own church her mind was set on doing what ever it took to assist the united states in winning the war it is the bible against mein kampf it is the cross against the swastika it is god against the antichrist of japan this is no time for pacifism the angelus temple itself became a visible symbol of home front sacrifice for the war effort if necessary it was announced the building could be used for an air raid shelter the distinctive white dome was painted over with black paint and its beautiful stainedglass windows were covered up the temple like other buildings in the city had to have any opening or window that could emit visible light at night covered one evening in may  to advertise the need to conserve gasoline and rubber mcpherson herself drove a horse and buggy to the angelus temple rubber and other drives were organized and unlimited airtime on her radio station kfsg was given to the office of war information she asked parishioners and other listeners to donate two hours a day for such tasks as rolling bandages so that a soldiers bandage could be changed and let us give our blood to help every one money was raised to provide local military bases with comfortable furnishings and radios newsweek published an article about mcpherson the worlds greatest living minister on july   noting she had collected  pints of blood for the red cross servicemen in her audience are especially honored and the climax of her church services is when she reads the national anthem mcpherson gave visiting servicemen autographed bibles she observed they often had no religious affiliation and did not even own a bible she wrote what a privilege it was to invite the servicemen present in every sunday night meeting to come to the platform where i greeted them gave each one a new testament and knelt in prayer with them for their spiritual needs and god’s guidance and protection on their lives later when the altar call would be given many of these same servicemen would make another trip to the platform publicly to receive jesus christ as their personal savior she insulted adolf hitler and hideki tōjō and became involved in war bond rallies pershing squares victory house in los angeles never saw a bigger crowd mcpherson sold  worth of bonds in one hour on june   breaking all previous records then repeated the performance again on july   the us treasury awarded her a special citation the army made mcpherson an honorary colonel her wartime activities included sermons that linked the church and american patriotism mcpherson spoke to the men in uniform of her belief that military action against the axis powers was long overdue and more so than in almost any war previously she felt that if they did not prevail churches homes and everything precious and dear to the christian would absolutely be destroyed mcphersons embrace of the total war strategy of the united states left her open to some criticism the line between the church as an independent moral authority monitoring government became blurred perceived instead as complicit with that same governance wrongs being done to japanese americans through their internment in relocation camps were being overlooked for example and she refused to allow her denomination to support christians who remained committed pacifists even if conscientious objectors were willing to participate in noncombat roles more was needed church members and leaders had to be willing to take up arms and fight for the united states the pacifist clause which earlier existed was by her proposal voted upon and eliminated by foursquare gospel church leaders deathedit mcphersons grave on september   mcpherson went to oakland california for a series of revivals planning to preach her popular story of my life sermon when mcphersons son went to her hotel room at  the next morning he found her unconscious with pills and a halfempty bottle of capsules nearby she was dead by  it was later discovered she previously called her doctor that morning to complain about feeling ill from the medicine but he was in surgery and could not be disturbed she then phoned another doctor who referred her to yet another physician however mcpherson apparently lost consciousness before the third could be contacted the autopsy did not conclusively determine the cause of mcphersons death she had been taking sleeping pills following numerous health problems – including tropical fever among the pills found in the hotel room was the barbiturate seconal a strong sedative which had not been prescribed for her it was unknown how she obtained them the coroner said she most likely died of an accidental overdose compounded by kidney failure the cause of death is officially listed as unknown given the circumstances there was speculation about suicide but most sources generally agree the overdose was accidental as stated in the coroners report fortyfive thousand people waited in long lines some until  am to file past the evangelist where for three days her body lay in state at the angelus temple within a mileandahalf  m radius of the church police had to double park cars it later took  trucks to transport the  worth of flowers to the cemetery which itself received more telegrammed floral orders than at any time since will rogers death almost  years earlier a foursquare leader noted that to watch the long line pass reverently by her casket and see tears shed by all types of people regardless of class and color helped give understanding to the farreaching influence of her life and ministry an observer marcus bach who was on a spiritual odyssey of personal discovery wrote roberta who had married an orchestra director flew in from new york ma kennedy was at the grave rheba crawford splivalo had returned to say that there was never a greater worker for god than sister a thousand ministers of the foursquare gospel paid their tearful tribute the curious stood by impressed the poor who had always been fed at angelus were there the lost who had been spiritfilled the healed the faithful here they were eager to immortalize the ontario farm girl who loved the lord here they laid the body of sister aimee to rest in the marble sarcophagus guarded by two great angels on sunrise slope  millions of dollars passed through mcphersons hands however when her personal estate was calculated it amounted to  to her daughter roberta went  the remainder to her son rolf by contrast her mother mildred kennedy had a  severance settlement of as much as  in cash and property the foursquare church itself was worth  million mcpherson is buried in forest lawn memorial park cemetery in glendale california following her death the foursquare gospel church denomination was led for  years by her son rolf mcpherson the church claims a membership of over  million worldwide legacy and influenceedit ministryedit mcphersons ministry continued to flourish even in the face of scandal the newspapers which served to propel mcpherson to fame and advertise her message also were used to highlight her faults real and imagined some modern televangelists who transgressed and faded into obscurity because of highprofile news coverage also learned how quickly modern communication media could hurt as well as help them after her death the largely negative aspect of her media image persisted was cultivated and became the dominant factor in defining mcpherson for many in the public today reverend robert p shuler whose caustic view of mcpherson softened over the years wrote he could not figure out why god chose such a person the flaws he observed in mcpherson were by his opinion many yet she ultimately made a positive impact on christianity long lasting and enduring  he recognized her appeal was a combination of identifying with the average citizen as well as an ability to explain the gospel in simple easily understandable terms drawing them irresistibly to her services while great cathedral churches closed their doors on sunday night the crowds pushed through her portals in one everflowing stream he saw her legacy extend far beyond the glamor of hollywood exerting itself through the thousands of ministers she trained and churches planted throughout the world mcpherson together with the alliances she made worked to reshape the evangelical christian faith making it relevant to american culture and personally involving for those in the audience legacyedit uldine utley c  in fresno california  nineyearold uldine utley – became a fervent believer after hearing mcphersons dramatic retelling of the david and goliath story the young girl tearfully gave her life over to christ and dedicated herself to be a little david for the lord and fight goliath with her parents as managers she went on to preach to millions of people and converted many thousands the most notable of these was john sung who would become a major evangelical figure in china utley frequently used the same metaphors as mcpherson referring to christ as the rose of sharon and invoking bride of christ imagery during the great depression years as a child dr edwin louis coles mother attended life bible college and as he grew up cole participated in various angelus temple activities witnessing the miraculous cole went on to found the christian mens network and influenced many including bill mccartney founder of promise keepers pat robertson john maxwell president of injoy ministries kenneth copeland oliver north and chuck norris according biographer matthew avery sutton in the early s it was expected traditional protestantism would give way to rapidly developing new philosophical ideas and sciences that were being widely taught mcpherson contributed immensely to the forestalling of that predicted inevitability liberal christianity which enjoyed strong growth starting in the late th century regarded many of the miracles of jesus to be superstitious interpretations of what actually occurred or metaphors for his teachings mcphersons faithhealing demonstrations instead gave credence to onlookers her claim was true jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever this bible verse of hebrews  as biographer daniel mark epstein noted as per mcpherson meant jesus still had power and could heal as in ancient times and the verse become the motto of her foursquare gospel church sutton wrote conveying it was easy for many people to deny a god who did something  years ago but large crowds of people were now witness to the blind seeing the lame walking and the deaf hearing healings at her services according to epstein from period news sources were occurring faster than the journalists could write them down crowds clamored to reach her altar to experience a new testament conversion that transformed many of their lives even large portions of the secular public admired her the old time gospel message was being dramatically marketed by the most technologically advanced means possible reconstructing it into something far more interesting and desirable than it was previously mcphersons ecumenical approach assisted pentecostals in learning how better to explain their faith in the context of historic church doctrine mainline churches became exposed to the more unusual gifts of the holy spirit they also benefited by borrowing pentecostal revival techniques such as more emotive expression joyful praise worship and testimonials forerunning the charismatic movement mcpherson challenged what was expected from women females as preachers and her status as a divorcee with two failed marriages were of particular concern to many of the fundamentalist churches with which she wanted to work but her success could not be easily ignored meanwhile secular society broadly labeled women as either victorian ladies or whores and she bounced from one category to the other she had her extensive relief charities and along with it titillating scandals atheist charles lee smith remarked publicly of mcpherson just before a debate that she had an extraordinary mind particularly for a woman her continual work at church alliancebuilding finally bore fruit in an official way though she did not live to see it foursquare gospel church leaders were at last able to join the national association of evangelicals in  and from there helped organize the pentecostal world fellowship which exists to the present day pentecostalism which once advocated separatism and was on the fringes of protestantism became part of mainstream christianity works about mcphersonedit books

her other predecessors she conducted public faith healing demonstrations before large crowds testimonies conveyed tens of thousands of people healed mcphersons articulation of the united states as a

her mother mildred known as minnie who worked with the poor in salvation army soup kitchens as a child she would play salvation army with her classmates and at home she would gather a congregation with her dolls giving them a sermon as a teenager mcpherson strayed from her mothers teachings by reading novels and going to movies and dances activities which were strongly disapproved of by both the salvation army and the religion of her father james kennedy a methodist novels though made their way into the methodist church library and with guilty delight mcpherson would read them at the movies she recognized some of her fellow methodist church members she learned too at a local dance she attended that her dancing partner was a presbyterian minister in high school she was taught charles darwins theory of evolution she began to quiz visiting preachers and local pastors about faith and science but was unhappy with the answers she received she wrote to the canadian newspaper family herald and weekly star questioning why taxpayerfunded public schools had courses such as evolution which undermined christianity this was her first exposure to fame as people nationwide responded to her letter while still in high school after her pentecostal conversion mcpherson began a crusade against the concept of evolution beginning a lifelong passion conversionedit robert and aimee semple  while attending a revival meeting in december  aimee met robert james semple a pentecostal missionary from ireland there her faith crisis ended as she decided to dedicate her life to god and made the conversion to pentecostalism as she witnessed the holy spirit moving powerfully marriage and familyedit at that same revival meeting aimee became enraptured not only by the message that robert semple gave but also with robert himself she decided to dedicate her life to both god and robert and after a short courtship they were married on august   in a salvation army ceremony pledging never to allow their marriage to lessen their devotion to god affection for comrades or faithfulness in the army the pairs notion of army was very broad encompassing much more than just the salvation army robert supported them as a foundry worker and preached at the local pentecostal mission together they studied the bible aimee claiming robert taught her all she knew though other observers state she was far more knowledgeable than she let on after a few months they moved to chicago and became part of william durhams full gospel assembly durham earlier had visited the mission where the azusa street revival was taking place returned and applied its teachings under durhams tutelage aimee was discovered to have a unique ability in the interpretation of speaking in tongues translating with stylistic eloquence aimee semple and her second husband harold mcpherson for a time harold traveled with his wife aimee in the gospel caras an itinerant preacher himself helping her to set up tents for revival meetings after embarking on an evangelistic tour to china both contracted malaria robert also contracted dysentery of which he died in hong kong aimee recovered and gave birth to their daughter roberta star semple as a yearold widow on board a ship returning to the united states aimee semple started a sunday school class then held other services as well oftentimes mentioning her late husband in her sermons almost all passengers attended shortly after her recuperation in the united states semple joined her mother minnie working with the salvation army while in new york city she met harold stewart mcpherson an accountant they were married on may   moved to providence rhode island and had a son rolf potter kennedy mcpherson in march  during this time mcpherson felt as though she denied her calling to go preach after struggling with emotional distress and obsessive–compulsive disorder she would fall to weep and pray she felt the call to preach tug at her even more strongly after the birth of rolf then in  she fell seriously ill and mcpherson states she again heard the persistent voice asking her to go preach while in the holding room after a failed operation mcpherson accepted the voices challenge and she suddenly opened her eyes and was able to turn over in bed without pain one spring morning in  her husband returned home from the night shift to discover mcpherson had left him and taken the children a few weeks later a note was received inviting him to join her in evangelistic work aimee semple mcpherson and her third husband david l hutton enjoying their honeymoon breakfast to avoid news publicity they chartered a plane to yuma arizona and were married in a small ceremony hutton assisted in some of mcphersons charity work before their divorce in  her husband later followed mcpherson to take her back home when he saw her though preaching to a crowd he witnessed her transformation into a radiant lovely woman before long he became her fellow worker in christ their house in providence was sold and he joined her in setting up tents for revival meetings and even did some preaching himself throughout their journey food and accommodations were uncertain as they lived out of the gospel car her husband in spite of initial enthusiasm wanted a life that was more stable and predictable eventually he returned to rhode island and around  filed for separation he petitioned for divorce citing abandonment the divorce was granted in  she married again on september   to actor and musician david hutton followed by much drama after which she fainted and fractured her skull while mcpherson was away in europe to recover she was angered to learn hutton was billing himself as aimees man in his cabaret singing act and was frequently photographed with scantily clad women huttons muchpublicized personal scandals were damaging the foursquare gospel church and their leaders credibility with other churches mcpherson and hutton separated in  and divorced on march   mcpherson later publicly repented of the marriage as wrong from the beginning for both theological and personal reasons and therefore rejected nationally known gospel singer homer rodeheaver a more appropriate suitor when he eventually asked for her hand in  early careeredit while married to robert semple the two moved to chicago and became part of william durhams full gospel assembly there aimee was discovered to have a unique ability in the interpretation of speaking in tongues translating with stylistic eloquence the otherwise indecipherable utterances of glossolalia unable to find fulfillment as a housewife in  mcpherson began evangelizing and holding tent revivals across the sawdust trail in the united states and canada after her first successful visits she had little difficulty with acceptance or attendance eager converts filled the pews of local churches which turned many recalcitrant ministers into her enthusiastic supporters frequently she would start a revival meeting in a hall or church and then have to move to a larger building to accommodate the growing crowds when no buildings were suitable she set up a tent which was often filled past capacity she wanted to create the enthusiasm a pentecostal meeting could provide with its amen corner and halleluiah chorus but also to avoid its unbridled chaos as participants started shouting trembling on the floor and speaking in tongues all at once mcpherson organized her meetings with the general public in mind and yet did not wish to quench any who suddenly came into the spirit to this she set up a tarry tent or room away from the general area for any who suddenly started speaking in tongues or display any other holy ghost behavior by which the larger audience might be put off in  mcpherson embarked on a tour of the southern united states in her gospel car and again later in  with her mother mildred kennedy mildred was an important addition to mcphersons ministry and managed everything including the money which gave them an unprecedented degree of financial security their vehicle was a  packard touring car emblazoned with religious slogans standing on the back seat of the convertible mcpherson preached sermons over a megaphone on the road between sermons she would sit in the back seat typing sermons and other religious materials she first traveled up and down the eastern united states then went to other parts of the country by  she had started her own magazine the bridal call for which she wrote many articles about women’s roles in religion she portrayed the link between christians and jesus as a marriage bond along with taking seriously the religious role of women the magazine contributed to transforming pentecostalism from a movement into an ongoing american religious presence  while mcpherson was traveling for her evangelical work she arrived in baltimore where she was first discovered by the newspapers in  after a day of conducting evangelistic services at the lyric opera house baltimore became one of the pivotal points for her early career the crowds in their religious ecstasy were barely kept under control as they gave way to manifestations of the spirit moreover her alleged faith healings now became part of the public record and attendees began to focus on that part of her ministry over all else mcpherson also considered the baltimore revival an important turning point not only for her ministry but in the history of the outpouring of the pentecostal power  career in los angelesedit in late  mcpherson came to los angeles a move many at the time were making for better opportunities minnie kennedy her mother rented the largest hall they could find the seat philharmonic auditorium known then as temple auditorium people waited for hours to get in and mcpherson could hardly reach the pulpit without stepping on someone afterwards grateful attendees of her los angeles meetings built a home for her family and her which included everything from the cellar to a canary bird at this time los angeles had become a popular vacation spot rather than touring the united states to preach her sermons mcpherson stayed in los angeles drawing audiences from a population which had soared from  in  to  people in  and often included many visitors wearied by constant traveling and having nowhere to raise a family mcpherson had settled in los angeles where she maintained both a home and a church mcpherson believed that by creating a church in los angeles her audience would come to her from all over the country this she felt would allow her to plant seeds of the gospel and tourists would take it home to their communities still reaching the masses for several years she continued to travel and raise money for the construction of a large domed church building at  glendale blvd in the echo park area of los angeles the church would be named angelus temple reflecting the roman catholic tradition of the angelus bell calling the faithful to prayer as well its reference to the angels not wanting to take on debt mcpherson located a construction firm which would work with her as funds were raised by faith she started with  the firm indicated it would be enough to carve out a hole for the foundation mcpherson began a campaign in earnest and was able to mobilize diverse groups of people to help fund and build the new church various fundraising methods were used such as selling chairs for temple seating at us  apiece in exchange chairholders got a miniature chair and encouragement to pray daily for the person who would eventually sit in that chair her approach worked to generate enthusiastic giving and to create a sense of ownership and family among the contributors raising more money than she had hoped mcpherson altered the original plans and built a megachurch that would draw many followers throughout the years the endeavor cost contributors around  in actual money spent however this price was low for a structure of its size costs were kept down by donations of building materials and volunteer labor mcpherson sometimes quipped when she first got to california all she had was a car ten dollars and a tambourine enrollment grew exceeding  and was advertised to be the largest single christian congregation in the world according to church records angelus temple received  million visitors within the first seven years mcpherson intended the angelus temple as both a place of worship and an ecumenical center for persons of all christian faiths to meet and build alliances a wide range of clergy and laypeople consisted of methodists baptists the salvation army presbyterians episcopalians adventists quakers roman catholics mormons and even secular civic leaders who came to the angelus temple they were welcomed and many made their way to her podium as guest speakers eventually even rev robert p shuler a oncerobust mcpherson critic was featured as a guest preacher because pentecostalism was not popular in the united states during the s mcpherson avoided the label she practiced speakingintongues and faith healing within her services but kept the former to a minimum in sermons to appease mainstream audiences discarded medical fittings from persons faithhealed during her services which included crutches wheelchairs and other paraphernalia were gathered for display in a museum area as evidence of her early influence by the salvation army mcpherson adopted a theme of lighthouses for the satellite churches referring to the parent church as the salvation navy this was the beginning of mcpherson working to plant foursquare gospel churches around the country charitable workedit mcpherson left prepares christmas food baskets about  mcpherson strove to develop a church organization which could not only provide for the spiritual but also the physical needs of the distressed though she fervently believed and preached the imminent return of jesus christ she had no idea of how soon that second coming might be two thoughts pervaded the mind of most devout pentecostals of the time jesus is coming therefore how can i get ready and how can i help others to get ready for mcpherson part of the answer was to mobilize her temple congregation and everyone she could reach through radio telephone and word of mouth to get involved in substantial amounts of charity and social work true christianity is not only to be good but to do good she preached the charities and beneficiary department collected donations for all types of humanitarian relief to include a japanese disaster as well as a german relief fund men released from prison were found jobs by a brotherhood a sisterhood was created as well sewing baby clothing for impoverished mothers branch churches elsewhere in the country were likewise encouraged to follow the angelus temples example even people who considered mcphersons theology almost ridiculous helped out because they saw her church as the best way to assist their community in june  after confirming reports of an earthquake in santa barbara mcpherson immediately left the parsonage and interrupted a broadcast at a nearby radio station she took over the microphone from the startled singer and requested food blankets clothing or whatever listeners could give for emergency supplies to assist nearby santa barbara as the red cross met to discuss and organize aid mcphersons second convoy had already arrived at the troubled city in  after a dam failed and the ensuing flood left up to  dead in its wake mcphersons church led the relief effort later in  an earthquake struck and devastated long beach mcpherson quickly arranged for volunteers to be on the scene with blankets coffee and doughnuts men wait in line to enter aimee semple mcphersons angelus temple free dining hall  commissary located at  w temple street at the time she was married to david hutton and all branding reflected his last name drawing from her childhood experience with the salvation army in  mcpherson opened a commissary at angelus temple which was devised to assist the needy on a much larger formalized scale the commissary was virtually the only place in town a person could get food clothing and blankets with no questions asked it was open  hours a day seven days a week and became active in creating soup kitchens free clinics and other charitable activities as the great depression wore on she fed an estimated  million people when the government shut down the free schoollunch program mcpherson took it over her policy of giving first and investigating afterward allowed waste and a certain number of deadbeats to leech off the program but it alleviated suffering on an epic scale mcpherson got the fire and police departments to assist in distribution doctors physicians and dentists were persuaded to staff her free clinic that trained  nurses to help treat children and the elderly she encouraged individuals and companies of all types to donate supplies food cash or labor to prevent the power from being turned off to homes of overdue accounts during the winter a  cash reserve was set up with the utility company many people who otherwise would have nothing to do with the angelus temple would receive a call from mcpherson and then loot their mansion closets or company stores for something to give the yellow cab company donated a large building and in the first month  people received meals there laboring under a sign everybody and anybody is somebody to jesus volunteer workers filled commissary baskets with an assortment of food and other items as well as foursquare gospel literature and handed them out even a complete kit designed to care for newborn babies was available a reporter wrote he had always thought the breadline was a drab colorless scar on our civilization but of the angelus temple commissary he observed was the warm garment of sympathy and christian succor a note which reflects the sentiment of many of those who received assistance was left in june  at mcphersons virtual gravesite my grandpa always talked about when he was a kid he and his family moved to california from missouri during the depression and his family was starving and they met you and you gave them a bag of vegetables and some money he never forgot it anonymous establishing an employment bureau as well mcpherson desired to help the discouraged husband the despondent widow or the little mother who wants extra work to bear the burden of a sick husband she expected everyone in her temple to be involved let us ever strive to lighten our brothers load and dry the tears of a sister race creed or status make no difference we are all one in the eyes of the lord she encouraged members to think of the commissary as widening the spirituality of the whole church line of unemployed men getting meals at dining hall run by aimee semple mcpherson  in  the commissary was raided by police to allegedly locate a still used to make brandy out of donated apricots some sauerkraut and salad oil were purportedly observed leaking from their respective storage areas as a consequence the commissary was briefly shut down the press got involved and the public demanded an investigation since no one really wanted to stall the temples charity efforts the acceptable solution was to replace the immediate management the staff was let go and students from her foursquare gospel churchs life bible college filled in the newspaper media generally cynical of the temple and in particular of mcpherson recognized the excellent features of that organizations efforts and the faults of the angelus temple are outweighed by its virtues mcpherson issued a statement declaring they have clashed loud their cymbals and blown their trumpets about a still and some sauerkraut our work is still before us ifanybody abused his trust it must not happen again as mcpherson tried to avoid administrative delays in categorizing the deserving from the undeserving her temple commissary became known as one of the regions most effective and inclusive aid institutions few soup kitchens lasted more than several months but mcphersons remained open even as she transformed herself into a fashionable blonde hollywood socialite mcphersons vigor and practicality for social activism did not change she loved organizing big projects a  survey indicated the angelus temple assisted more family units than any other public or private institution in the city because her programs aided nonresidents as well such as migrants from other states and mexico she ran afoul of california state regulations though temple guidelines were later officially adjusted to accommodate those policies helping families in need was a priority regardless of their place of residence actor anthony quinn recalls this was all during the height of the depression when hunger and poverty permeated america many mexicans were terrified of appealing for county help because most of them were in the country illegally when in distress they were comforted by the fact that they could call one of aimees branches at any time of the night there they would never be asked any of the embarrassing questions posed by the authorities the fact that they were hungry or in need of warm clothing was enough no one even asked if they belonged to aimees church or not ministryedit style of ministryedit in august  and away from los angeles mcpherson decided to charter a plane so she would not miss giving her sunday sermon aware of the opportunity for publicity she arranged for at least  followers and members of the press to be present at the airport the plane failed after takeoff and the landing gear collapsed sending the nose of the plane into the ground mcpherson boarded another plane and used the experience as the narrative of an illustrated sunday sermon called the heavenly airplane the stage in angelus temple was set up with two miniature planes and a skyline that looked like los angeles in this sermon mcpherson described how the first plane had the devil for the pilot sin for the engine and temptation as the propeller the other plane however was piloted by jesus and would lead one to the holy city the skyline shown on stage the temple was filled beyond capacity angelus temple completed in  is the center of the international church of the foursquare gospel founded by mcpherson in  angelus temple was designated a national historic landmark it is still in active use on another occasion she described being pulled over by a police officer calling the sermon arrested for speeding dressed in a traffic cops uniform she sat in the saddle of a police motorcycle earlier placed on the stage and revved the siren one author in attendance insisted she actually drove the motorcycle with its deafening roar across the access ramp to the pulpit slammed on the brakes then raised a whitegloved hand to shout stop youre speeding to hell since mcpherson gave some of her sermons more than once and with variations the possibility existed both versions might be true mcpherson employed a small group of artists electricians decorators and carpenters who built the sets for each sundays service religious music was played by an orchestra mcpherson also worked on elaborate sacred operas one production the iron furnace based on the book of exodus told of god’s deliverance as the israelites fled slavery in egypt some hollywood movie stars even assisted with obtaining costumes from local studios the cast was large perhaps as many as  people but so elaborate and expensive it was presented only one time rehearsals for the various productions were timeconsuming and mcpherson did not tolerate any nonsense though described as always kind and loving mcpherson demanded respect regarding the divine message the sacred operas and her other works were designed to convey aimee semple mcpherson surrounded by massed choirs at angelus temple for a musical requiem in  even though mcpherson condemned theater and film as the devils workshop its secrets and effects were coopted she became the first woman evangelist to adopt the whole technique of the moving picture star mcpherson desired to avoid the dreary church service where by obligation parishioners would go to fulfill some duty by being present in the pew she wanted a sacred drama that would compete with the excitement of vaudeville and the movies the message was serious but the tone more along the lines of a humorous musical comedy animals were frequently incorporated and mcpherson the once farm girl knew how to handle them mcpherson gave up to  sermons a week and the lavish sunday night service attracted the largest crowds extra trolleys and police were needed to help route the traffic through echo park to and from angelus temple to finance the angelus temple and its projects collections were taken at every meeting often with the admonishment no coins please mcpherson preached a conservative gospel but used progressive methods taking advantage of radio movies and stage acts advocacy for womens rights was on the rise including womens suffrage through the th amendment she attracted some women associated with modernism but others were put off by the contrast between her different theories by accepting and using such new media outlets mcpherson helped integrate them into people’s daily lives sister mcpherson used the media to her advantage as she became the first modern celebrity preacher minister aimee semple mcpherson and a group of tambourine players leading a service at angelus temple she was very innovative in producing weekly dramas illustrating religious themes the battle between fundamentalists and modernists escalated after world war i with many modernists seeking less conservative religious faiths fundamentalists generally believed their religious faith should influence every aspect of their lives mcpherson sought to eradicate modernism and secularism in homes churches schools and communities she developed a strong following in what mcpherson termed the foursquare gospel by blending contemporary culture with religious teachings mcpherson was entirely capable of sustaining a protracted intellectual discourse as her bible students and debate opponents will attest but she believed in preaching the gospel with simplicity and power so as to not confuse the message her distinct voice and visual descriptions created a crowd excitement bordering on hysteria the appeal of mcphersons  or so revival events from  to  surpassed any touring event of theater or politics ever presented in american history neither houdini nor teddy roosevelt had such an audience nor pt barnum her one to fourweek meetings typically overflowed any building she could find to hold them she broke attendance records recently set by billy sunday and frequently used his temporary tabernacle structures in which to hold some of her meetings her revivals were often standingroom only one such revival was held in a boxing ring with the meeting before and after the match throughout the boxing event she walked about with a sign reading knock out the devil in san diego california the city called in the national guard and other branches of the armed forces to control a revival crowd over  people she became one of the most photographed persons of her time she enjoyed the publicity and quotes on almost every subject were sought from her by journalists faith healing ministryedit main article faith healing ministry of aimee semple mcpherson mcphersons ability to draw crowds was also greatly assisted by her apparently successful faith healing presentations almost by accident she discovered when she laid hands on sick or injured persons they got well one early mcpherson biographer nancy barr mavity described the healing power beyond her conscience sic control and profoundly troubling however a phenomenon familiar to the psychiatrist although none the less sic mysterious  during a  revival meeting in corona long island new york a young woman in the advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis was brought to the altar by friends mcpherson would have preferred to pray with her privately however the woman insisted upon immediate prayer mcpherson laid hands on her and prayed before the gathered parishioners the woman walked out of the church without crutches mcphersons reputation as a faith healer rapidly became known and the sick and injured people came to her by the tens of thousands the faith healing ministry of aimee semple mcpherson was extensively written about in the news media and was a large part of her early career legacy no one has ever been credited by secular witnesses with anywhere near the numbers of faith healings attributed to mcpherson especially during the years  to  over time though she almost withdrew from the faithhealing aspect of her services since it was overwhelming other areas of her ministry scheduled weekly and monthly healing sessions nevertheless remained highly popular with the public until her death in  the foursquare churchedit foursquare church logo eventually mcphersons church evolved into its own denomination and became known as the international church of the foursquare gospel usually referenced as the foursquare church foursquare is an alternative word for full gospel a term used by pentecostals referencing the nature of christs character that he was savior baptizer with the holy spirit healer and sooncoming king the four main beliefs were the first being christs ability to transform individuals lives through the act of salvation the second focused on a holy baptism which includes receiving power to glorify and exalt christ in a practical way the third was divine healing newness of life for both body and spirit and the fourth was gospeloriented heed to the premillennial return of jesus christ mcpherson published the weekly foursquare crusader along with her monthly magazine bridal call she began broadcasting on radio in the early s on a sunday morning in april  the rockridge radio station in oakland ca offered her some radio time and she became the first woman to preach a sermon over the wireless telephone with the opening of foursquare gospelowned kfsg on february   she became the second woman granted a broadcast license by the department of commerce the federal agency that supervised broadcasting in the early s mcpherson racially integrated her tent meetings and church services on one occasion as a response to mcphersons ministry and angelus temple being integrated ku klux klan members were in attendance but after the service hoods and robes were found on the ground in nearby echo park she is also credited with helping many hispanic ministries in los angeles mcpherson traveling about the country holding widely popular revival meetings and filling local churches with converts was one thing settling permanently into their city caused concern among some local los angeles churches though she shared many of their fundamentalist beliefs such as divine inspiration of the bible the classical trinity virgin birth of jesus historical reality of christs miracles bodily resurrection of christ and the atoning purpose of his crucifixion the presentation of lavish sermons and an effective faithhealing ministry presented by a female divorcee whom thousands adored and about whom newspapers continuously wrote was unexpected moreover the temple especially the women had a look and style uniquely theirs they would emulate mcphersons style and dress and a distinct angelus temple uniform came into existence a white dress with a navy blue cape thrown over it men were more discreet wearing suits her voice projected over the powerful stateoftheart kfsg radio station and heard by hundreds of thousands became the most recognized in the western united states mcpherson preaching at the newly built angelus temple in  her messages showcased the love of god redemption and the joys of service and heaven contrasting sharply with the fireandbrimstone style of sermon delivery popular with many of her peers her illustrated sermons attracted criticism from some clergy members because they thought it turned the gospel message into mundane theater and entertainment divine healing as mcpherson called it was claimed by many pastors to be a unique dispensation granted only for apostolic times rival radio evangelist reverend robert p shuler published a pamphlet entitled mcphersonism which purported that her most spectacular and advertised program was out of harmony with gods word debates such as the bogardmcpherson debate in  drew further attention to the controversy but none could really argue effectively against mcphersons results the new developing assemblies of god denomination pentecostal as mcpherson was for a time worked with her but they encouraged separation from established protestant faiths mcpherson resisted trends to isolate as a denomination and continued her task of coalitionbuilding among evangelicals mcpherson worked hard to attain ecumenical vision of the faith and while she participated in debates avoided pitched rhetorical battles that divided so many in christianity she wanted to work with existing churches on projects and to share with them her visions and beliefs assisting in her passion was the speedy establishment of life bible college adjacent to the angeles temple ministers trained there were originally intended to go nationally and worldwide to all denominations and share her newly defined foursquare gospel a wellknown methodist minister frank thompson who never had the pentecostal experience was persuaded to run the college and he taught the students the doctrine of john wesley mcpherson and others meanwhile infused them with pentecostal ideals for about a year antonia frederick futterer suggested by los angeles times as the inspiration for steven spielbergs film character indiana jones was also a facility member mcphersons efforts eventually led pentecostals which were previously unconventional and on the periphery of christianity into the mainstream of american evangelicalism life in the media spotlightedit media relationsedit by early  mcpherson had become one of the most charismatic and influential women and ministers of her time her fame equaled to name a few charles lindbergh johnny weissmuller jack dempsey babe ruth ty cobb knute rockne bobby jones louise brooks and rudolph valentino she was a major american phenomenon who along with some other highprofile preachers of the time unlike hollywood celebrities could be admired by their adoring public without apparently compromising their souls according to carey mcwilliams she had become more than just a household word she was a folk hero and a civic institution an honorary member of the fire and police departments a patron saint of the service clubs an official spokesman for the community on problems grave and frivolous she was influential in many social educational and political areas mcpherson made personal crusades against anything that she felt threatened her christian ideals including the drinking of alcohol and teaching evolution in schools mcpherson became a strong supporter of william jennings bryan during the  scopes trial in which john scopes was tried for illegally teaching evolution at a dayton tennessee school bryan and mcpherson had worked together in the angelus temple and they believed darwinism had undermined students morality according to the new yorker mcpherson said evolution is the greatest triumph of satanic intelligence in  years of devilish warfare against the hosts of heaven it is poisoning the minds of the children of the nation she sent bryan a telegram saying ten thousand members of angelus temple with her millions of radio church membership send grateful appreciation of your lionhearted championship of the bible against evolution and throw our hats in the ring with you she organized an allnight prayer service a massive church meeting preceded by a bible parade through los angeles politicsedit while her mother mildred kennedy was a registered democrat no one was certain of mcphersons registration she endorsed herbert hoover over franklin d roosevelt but enthusiastically threw her support behind the latter and his social programs when he was elected into office she was a patron of organized labor preaching a gangsters money was no more unclean than the dollars of the man who amasses his millions from underpaid factory workers she was more cautious though when labor strikes resulted in violent uprisings she saw in them the possible activities of communism which sought to infiltrate labor unions and other organizations mcpherson intensely disliked communism and its derivatives as they sought to rule without god their ultimate goal she believed was to remove christianity from the earth mcphersons opinion of fascism fared no better its totalitarian rule was wrongly justified by claiming to represent the power of god mcpherson did not align herself consistently with any broad conservative or liberal political agenda instead she explained if christianity occupied a central place in national life and if the components of god home school and government were kept together everything else would fall into place remove any of these she warned and civilization topples crumbles current foursquare gospel church leaders qualify the evangelists views mcpherson’s passion to see america sustained in spiritual health which compelled her quest to see the church influence government must be interpreted in light of the political and religious climate of the s s and s it is not accurate to draw a parallel between today’s extreme fundamentalist rightwing christianity and the style or focus of sister mcpherson she was also among the first prominent christian ministers to defend the establishment of a jewish homeland in palestine she related that when christ returns the jews would receive him their suffering will end and they will establish at jerusalem a kingdom more wonderful than the world has known reported kidnappingedit disappearance from venice beachedit main article reported kidnapping of aimee semple mcpherson minnie

media and changed her life and the course of her career after disappearing in may  she reappeared in mexico five weeks later stating she had been held for ransom in a desert shack there the subsequent grandjury inquiries over her reported kidnapping and escape precipitated continued public interest in her future misfortunes on may   mcpherson went with her secretary to ocean park beach north of venice beach to swim soon after arriving mcpherson was nowhere to be found it was thought she had drowned searchers combed the beach and nearby area but could not locate her body the angelus temple received letters and calls claiming knowledge of mcpherson including demands for ransom mcpherson sightings occurred around the country often in widely divergent locations many miles apart on the same day as a precaution the ransom notes were sent to the police who investigated at least one of them mildred kennedy though regarded the messages as hoaxes believing her daughter dead as the angelus temple prepared for a memorial service commemorating mcphersons death kennedy received a phone call from douglas arizona her daughter was alive the distraught mcpherson was resting in a douglas

held against her face causing her to pass out eventually she was moved to an adobe shack far in the desert two kidnappers steve and rose were her constant companions with a third unnamed man occasionally visiting when at last all her captors were away on errands she escaped out a window using a mountain as a landmark she traveled through the desert for around – hours across an estimated distance of  miles  km around  am she reached agua prieta sonora a mexican border town and collapsed near a house there she was assisted by the residents and finally taken to adjacent douglas return to los angelesedit after leaving douglas mcpherson was greeted at the los angeles train station by – people more than for almost any other personage the parade back to the temple even elicited a greater turnout than president woodrow wilsons visit to los angeles in  attesting to her popularity and the growing influence of mass media entertainment already incensed over mcphersons influential public stance on evolution and the bible most of the chamber of commerce and some other civic leaders saw the event as gaudy display nationally embarrassing to the city many los angeles area churches were also annoyed the story received nationwide coverage then speculations together with alleged witnesses began to emerge that her disappearance might have been caused by other than the kidnapping event mcpherson described against the wishes of her mother who thought the press would continue to unfavorably exploit the story mcpherson decided for vindication and presented her complaint in court a grand jury inquiry convened to determine if enough evidence could be found to indict any kidnappers however pressured by various influential community groups the court instead intensely investigated mcpherson her family and acquaintances to determine if the kidnapping was fabricated district attorney asa keyes led the prosecution against her he was known for winning convictions but six persons he sent to prison were found to be innocent and pardoned by the state governor grand jury inquiryedit the grand jury inquiries were first convened on july   adjourned and reconvened holding sessions through the summer of  accompanied by intense media interest the proceedings were supposed to be secret as per california law though the los angeles court spoke about it to the newspapers issues of trial by media and court of public opinion were apparent as much of the proclaimed evidence against mcpherson came from reporters who featured it in their news articles and passed it on to the police mcpherson also eschewed secrecy and freely used her radio station to broadcast her side of the story evidence and testimonies were hotly debated by an evenly divided public on november  the case was determined to be moved to jury trial set for midjanuary  along with mcpherson and her mother several other defendants were charged in the inquiry if convicted the counts added up to maximum prison time of  years various speculations were proffered by the news media and prosecution as to the reason for mcphersons disappearance the one they settled on most strongly was she ran off with an exemployee kenneth ormiston she was accused of staying with him in a california resort town cottage until may  the time frame of ormistons seaside cottage rental coincided with the first  days of her disappearance however a missing threeweek period afterwards was not accounted for with any evidence in court by the prosecution in response the evangelist maintained all along without changing anything in her story that she was taken held captive by the kidnappers and escaped as she originally described as the prosecution tried to break down her story defense witnesses corroborated her assertions  or mcpherson herself demonstrated how the disputed parts were plausible in contrast the prosecutions case developed serious credibility issues witnesses changed their testimonies and evidence often had suspicious origins or was mishandled while in custody finally on january   ormiston identified elizabeth tovey a nurse from seattle washington as his female companion and the woman who stayed with him at the seaside cottage all charges against mcpherson and associated parties were dropped by the court for the lack of evidence on january   after the case dismissaledit regardless of the courts decision months of unfavorable press reports fixed in much of the publics mind a certainty of mcphersons wrongdoing the newspapers had a vested interest in keeping the controversy going since it generated huge sales the bulk of the investigation against mcpherson was funded by los angelesarea newspapers at an estimated amount of  some supporters thought mcpherson should have insisted on the jury trial and clear her name the grand jury inquiry concluded while enough evidence did not exist to try her it did not indicate her story was true with its implication of kidnappers still at large court costs to mcpherson were estimated to be as high as  a jury trial could take months mcpherson moved on to other projects in  she published a book about her version of the kidnapping in the service of the king the story of my life various influential individuals offered their opinions on the inquiry in a letter to the los angeles times a few months after the case was dropped the reverend robert p shuler stated perhaps the most serious thing about this whole situation is the seeming loyalty of thousands to this leader in the face of her evident and positively proven guilt hl mencken noted journalist satirist cultural critic and scholar and an ideological opponent of mcpherson opposite each other in the  scopes monkey trial also commented he wrote that since many of that towns residents acquired their ideas of the true the good and the beautiful from the movies and newspapers los angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her claims of extramarital affairsedit during her lifetimeedit numerous allegations of illicit love affairs were often directed against mcpherson suspected lovers generally denied involvement for example kenneth ormiston a married man with a small son could have profited immensely from an exposé about himself and mcpherson whether the two had a good working relationship and were friendly with each other was not disputed during the  kidnapping grand jury trial reporters and investigators tried to link him amorously to mcpherson ormiston told newspapers his name connected in such a way to the evangelist was a gross insult to a noble and sincere woman mcpherson was often the target of numerous unsubstantiated sexually related allegations as reported by the los angeles times june   this photograph depicts the evangelist reading a note demanding  else nude motion pictures of her and a friend would be publicly released when inquired about it in an unrelated interview later that year she tersely stated nude pictures of her did not exist because none were ever taken alarmed by her rapidly changing style of dress and involvement with hollywood and its worldly lifestyle in  an angelus temple official hired detectives to shadow mcpherson through her windows the detectives frequently saw mcpherson staying up until the early morning hours composing songs drafting sacred operas and scribbling diagrams of her illustrated sermons they were looking for evidence of her indiscretions but found nothing no confirmation of adulterous misconduct with perhaps exception of her third marriage as a violation of church tenets was ever presented mcpherson herself aware of numerous accusations leveled at her throughout her career responded only to a small fraction of them conveying the only thing she had time for was preaching jesus posthumouslyedit posthumously unsubstantiated allegations of extramarital affairs continued to emerge this time by those who stated to have been her partner claims not mentioned by them or others while she was still alive canadian journalist gordon sinclair implied such a claim in his  autobiography will the real gordon sinclair please stand up sinclair stated he worked on a story with mcpherson and during one of those times in  the incident purportedly occurred sinclair alluded to a sexual dalliance with mcpherson one afternoon along with some gin and ginger thirty years after her death another claim by comedian milton berle in a  autobiography alleges a brief affair with the evangelist in his book titled milton berle an autobiography berle asserts he met mcpherson at the shrine auditorium in los angeles where both were doing a charity show biographer matthew avery sutton commented berle a notorious womanizer whose many tales of scandalous affairs were not always true claimed to have had sex with mcpherson on this and one other occasion both during a year when mcpherson was often ill and bedridden sutton noted that berles story of a crucifix in mcphersons bedroom was not consistent with the coolness of pentecostalcatholic relations during that era another book by milton berle laughingly yours which had autobiographical content that was published in  while mcpherson was still alive did not have this claim author raymond l cox states mrs mcphersons daughter roberta salter of new york told me mother never had an apartment in her life by  she kept herself securely chaperoned to guard against such allegations during  the evangelists appearances and whereabouts can be traced almost every day she was incapacitated with illness a full five months of that year and there is no place on her schedule as reported in her publications and church and travel records for the benefit berle alleged besides roberta also told cox mother never did a benefit in her life she had her own charities later life and careeredit mcpherson surrounded by flowers cutting into angelus temple cake  not one for settling into a predictable routine she used her birthday national holidays and other events as themes for church services and gala festivities after fallout with pressedit following her heyday in the s mcpherson carried on with her ministry but fell out of favor with the press they once dubbed her the miracle worker or miracle woman reporting extensively on her faithhealing demonstrations but now were anxious to relay every disturbance in her household to the headlines her developing difficulties with her mother mildred kennedy were starting to take the front page yet mcpherson emerged from the kidnapping nationally famous as much as  of the population in los angeles held membership in her temple for a time movie studios competed with each other offering mcpherson longterm contracts believing that talking pictures had the potential to transform christianity mcpherson explored hollywood culture and appeared in newsreels alongside other famous individuals such as mary pickford frances perkins and franklin d roosevelt she lost weight cut and dyed her hair began to wear makeup and jewelry and became stylish and wellattired a critic wrote mcpherson can outdress the hollywood stars the solicitation of fame justified to draw audiences to her and hence to christ was more than some in her church organization could accept they yearned for sister aimee in the old time dress referring to her previous trademarked uniform of a navy cape over a white servants dress both purchased inexpensively in bargain basements other members though loved it and her angelus temple services were as popular as ever and remained so throughout her life unless parishioners arrived to a service early frequently they could not get in all seats were taken now that she could afford it mcpherson thought as well she wanted her apparel and display to be the best she could present to jesus in early  mcpherson immediately set out on a vindication tour visiting various cities and taking advantage of the publicity her kidnapping story created to preach the gospel her visit to new york in foxfurs and a finely trimmed yellow suit was noted in the society pages she visited even nightclubs to include a famous speakeasy in new york texas guinan’s three hundred club on th street while mcpherson sipped water at her table guinan asked if she would speak a few words to the patrons delighted mcpherson stood and addressed the jazzed and boozy crowd behind all these beautiful clothes behind these good times in the midst of your lovely buildings and shops and pleasures there is another life there is something on the other side “what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul” with all your getting and playing and good times do not forget you have a lord take him into your hearts the unexpected speech that did not judge and had a conciliatory tone between them and the divine earned a thoughtful moment of silence from the crowd then an applause that went on for much longer than the speech took the revelers were invited to hear her preach at the glad tidings tabernacle on rd street the visits to speakeasies and nightclubs added to mcphersons notoriety newspapers reported heavily on them rumors erroneously conveyed she was drinking smoking and dancing and her mother along with some other church members did not understand mcphersons strategy of tearing down barriers between the secular and religious world between the sinner and the saved problems with mildred kennedyedit without mildred kennedys conservative financial management replacement administrators embarked on a spread of ambitious projects that often failed an example of this was lake tahoe lot deals of which the cover of an alleged prospectus describes not enough parcels of land were purchased and the subsequent lawsuit brought by investors drew unfavorable publicity and the attention of the district attorneys office in the summer of  mildred kennedy mcphersons mother left the angelus temple in an attempt to curtail her daughters influence and officially transfer more power to herself kennedy initiated a staffmember vote of confidence against mcpherson but lost the two had heatedly argued over management polices and mcphersons changing personal dress and appearance for similar reasons  members of the choir left as well the choir could be replaced however kennedys financial and administrative skills had been of crucial importance in growing mcphersons ministry from tent revivals to satellite churches and maintaining its current activities in the temple a series of less able management staff replaced kennedy and the temple became involved in various questionable projects such as hotel building cemetery plots and land sales accordingly the angelus temple plummeted deep into debt in response to the difficulties kennedy came back in late  but because of continued serious disagreements with mcpherson tendered her resignation on july   the following month mcpherson suffered a physical and nervous breakdown for  months she was absent from the pulpit diagnosed in part with acute acidosis resurrecting her careeredit when she gained strength and returned she introduced with renewed vigor her moving attar of roses sermon based on the song of solomon with its rose of sharon as the mystical body of christ while journalists attending her sunday illustrated sermons assumed her language was fit only for slapstick or sentimental entertainment scholars who have studied her work for bible students and small prayer groups found instead the complex discourse of neoplatonic interpretation the old testament book the song of solomon for example she had hundreds of pages written about it each different from one another as snowflakes the october –  revival in boston started out sluggishly and many predicted its failure a los angeles newspaper ran headlines of the flop and expected more of the same in the days to come on opening night mcpherson spoke to fewer than  persons in the seat sports arena and safety pins and rubber bands abundantly cluttered the collection baskets the city had large populations of unitarians episcopalians and catholics venerable denominations traditionally hostile to a pentecostal or fundamentalist message afterwards from her hotel room mcpherson known to be a sports fan asked for the afternoons world series scores and a boston herald reporter sent her a copy of the sunday edition the next day the bring back the bible to boston campaigns tone shifted as mcpherson took greater control and attendance climbed sharply a reporter took note of mcphersons stage presence different from any other evangelist who spoke there gesturing with her white bible for effect as well as preaching answering him as to why she presented a dramatic sermon she stated our god is a dramatic god rolling back the red sea elijah on the mountaintop the crucifixion the resurrection his ascension tongues of fire on the day of pentecost the final day of afternoon and evening services had  persons attending the stadium was full and more than  had to be turned away a total of  people attended the meetings breaking historic attendance records of any nine days of revival services in boston her revival in new york city was not very fruitful as her sensationalistic reputation preceded her the third marriage to david hutton rumored romances and her kidnapping was what its press and citizens wanted to hear about therefore after a brief pause in new york and washington dc she went on philadelphia and other cities traveling to  of them in  states speaking to as much as  of the entire population of the united states a full crew of musicians scene designers and costumers accompanied mcpherson in this her last national revival tour between september  and december   two million persons heard  sermons many more were reached by  radio stations the boston evening traveler newspaper reported aimees religion is a religion of joy there is happiness in it her voice is easy to listen to she does not appeal to the brain and try to hammer religion into the heads of her audience rather she appeals to the hearts of her hearers she radiates friendliness she creates an atmosphere that is warming she is persuasive rather than forceful gracious and kindly rather than compelling fundamentally she takes the whole bible literally from cover to cover nevertheless she was not a radical literalist in an informal meeting with some harvard students mcpherson told them that genesis allowed great latitude of interpretation and that neither she nor the bible insisted the world was created only  years ago in another meeting with students she heard their assertion the teachings of christ have outlived their usefulness education science and cold reasoning were the new saviors of the world thus compelled mcpherson decided to travel and look at the world with new eyes in  mcpherson embarked on a worldwide sixmonth discovery tour to examine the social religious and economic climates of many countries at one point it was earlier reported she wanted to study the womens movement in connection with the campaign for the independence of india and was anxious to have a chat with mahatma gandhi she received an invitation from him and he gave her a sari made from threads woven from his simple spinning wheel impressed with gandhi and his ideas mcpherson thought he might secretly lean towards christianity his dedication possibly coming from catching a glimpse of the cleansing lifting strengthening power of the nazarene other highlights included traversing barefoot in myanmar the lengthy stone path to the great pagoda a goldcovered ft tiered tower enshrining relics of four buddhas which caught and reflected the rays of the sun a vision of breathtaking glory she heard benito mussolini speak in italy and fretted war would again ensue in the rain at verdun france she sat on a wrecked military vehicle in mournful contemplation of the hundreds of thousands who died on the stilluncleared battlefield white bleached bones of the fallen poked out of the earth and nearby laborers toiled carefully at their dangerous iron harvest collecting old munitions for disposal in mid a delegation who had been involved with the  azusa street mission revivals including emma cotton asked if they could use the angelus temple for their th anniversary celebration the original mission building was demolished and its land unavailable african american evangelist emma cotton and mcpherson therefore organized a series of meetings which also marked her enthusiastic reidentification with the pentecostal movement mcphersons experiments of hollywood celebrity ambitions coexisting with her ministry were not as successful as she hoped alliances with other church groups were failing or no longer in effect and she searched for ways to start again therefore she looked to her spiritual origins and allowed for the possibility of reintroducing even the more alarming aspects of the pentecostal experience into her public meetings temple officials were concerned the azusa people might bring in some wildfire and holy rollerism mcpherson indicated she would turn hand springs with them as needed to see the power of god manifest the azusa street revival commemoration events brought numbers of black leaders to her pulpit the original attendees of the azusa revivals filled the angelus temple along with every ethnic minority the saints who were once smelted together with the fires of pentecost were being reunited rewelded and rejuvenated mcpherson recommitted herself to the dissemination of classic pentecostalism and her concern now was that foursquaredom was in the danger of becoming too churchy for the first time since the temple opened mcpherson began to publicly deliver some of her messages in tongues mcpherson traversed the line between cold formality and wildfire and now decided it was easier to cool down a hot fanatic than to resuscitate a corpse future meetings to celebrate the azusa street revivals included guest charles h mason a founder of the churches of god in christ mason an azusa leader was also one of the most significant african american religious figures in united states history and was frequently hosted at the angelus temple roberta star semple left mcphersons daughter aimee semplemcpherson middle and rheba crawford splivalo assistant pastorright at a parade in  problems with the templeedit also in  mcpherson reassigned staff responsibilities in an effort to address the temples financial difficulties this together with other unresolved issues accelerated simmering tensions among various staff members rumors circulated that angel of broadway charismatic evangelist rheba crawford splivalo who had been working extensively with mcpherson for several years planned to take the angelus temple from her mcpherson asked splivalo to leave town in the course of the staff controversy mcphersons lawyer issued a strongly worded press release that upset roberta star semple mcphersons daughter and led her to initiate a  lawsuit against him for slander splivalo also sued mcpherson for  because of alleged statements calling her a ‘jezebel and a judas’ and unfit to stand in the angelus temple pulpit the two lawsuits filed by semple and splivalo were not related but mcpherson did not see it that way she saw both as part of the temple takeover plot mcphersons mother was also involved and sided with semple her granddaughter making unflattering statements about mcpherson to the press in these charged circumstances mcphersons defense of herself and her lawyer in a public trial was dramatic and theatrical she testified tearfully with swoons and faints about how her daughter conspired with others against her her daughters lawyer meanwhile mocked mcpherson by imitating her mannerisms and making faces at her the trial did much to estrange mcpherson from her daughter the judge ruled for semple giving a  judgment in her favor semple then moved to new york splivalo and the temple settled their suit out of court for the cause of religion and the good of the community with kennedy semple and splivalo gone the temple lost much of its talented leadership however mcpherson found a competent and firm administrator in giles knight who was able to bring the temple out of debt dispose of the  or so lawsuits and eliminate the more spurious projects he sequestered mcpherson allowed her to receive only a few personal visitors and carefully regulated her activities outside the temple this period was one of unprecedented creativity for mcpherson no longer distracted by waves of reporters reams of lawsuits and innumerable individuals demanding her attention she became very accomplished in her illustrative sermon style of gospel preaching the irreligious charlie chaplin would secretly attend her services enjoying her sermons she later met and consulted with chaplin on ways to improve her presentations mcpherson who earlier blared across newspaper headlines as many as three times a week in one alleged scandal or another had her public image much improved her adversary reverend robert p shuler who previously attacked her by radio magazine pulpit and pamphlet proclaimed aimees missionary work was the envy of methodists he also expressed his support of her foursquare church application admittance into national association of evangelicals for united action in  her efforts at making interracial revival a reality at angelus temple continued she welcomed blacks into the congregation and pulpit while race riots burned detroit in  mcpherson publicly converted the notorious black former heavyweight champion jack johnson on the temple stage and embraced him “as he raised his hand in worship” war yearsedit views on waredit pacifism which was a component of pentecostalism was evaluated by the foursquare gospel church in the s with official statements and documents which were further revised by mcpherson a press quote attributed to mcpherson in reference to mahatma gandhi appears to explore the concept i want to incorporate the ideals of india with my own additionally clinton howard the chairman of the world peace commission was invited to speak at the angelus temple in  she promoted disarmament if the nations of the world would stop building warships and equipping armies we would be all but overwhelmed with prosperity foursquare leaders alarmed at rapid changes of technology especially sea and air which challenged the united states isolation and security decided to officially draw up an amendment inclusive of varied opinions in regards to military service the idea that one could trust to bear arms in a righteous cause as well as believing the killing of others even in connection to military service would endanger their souls both views were acceptable reaction to waredit mcpherson kept a canny eye on the international events leading up to the second world war citing the probability of a much more terrible conflict than the one that passed  years earlier in a sermon she described a recently conquered country which had the cross and other religious symbols in their schools removed in their place was a portrait of a certain man instead of prayer their school day began with a distinctive salute to this person the destructive apocalypse of john the apostle with its expected high civilian casualties followed by the second coming of christ it seemed was at hand even if submarines were hiding in the depths of the sea they could not escape the terror that would befall them congregation at angelus temple during hour holy ghost service led by aimee semple mcpherson los angeles calif  allnight prayer meetings were held friday nights at the angelus temple starting in  the year when germany was overrunning belgium the netherlands and france she asked other foursquare churches around the country to follow suit she sent president franklin roosevelts secretary mr stephen early as well as some other leaders an outline of her plans prayer to her was even more powerful than the implements of war various officials expressed their appreciation including the governor of california early passed on a reply back from roosevelt a message of thanks for her work a month later roosevelt declared a national day of prayer to beseech the ruler of the universe to bless our republic foursquare leaders thought mcpherson may have inspired it and perhaps the president of the united states was looking to her for spiritual leadership of the nation at the outbreak of world war ii mcpherson rejected the christian pacifism of many in the pentecostal movement including those of her own church her mind was set on doing what ever it took to assist the united states in winning the war it is the bible against mein kampf it is the cross against the swastika it is god against the antichrist of japan this is no time for pacifism the angelus temple itself became a visible symbol of home front sacrifice for the war effort if necessary it was announced the building could be used for an air raid shelter the distinctive white dome was painted over with black paint and its beautiful stainedglass windows were covered up the temple like other buildings in the city had to have any opening or window that could emit visible light at night covered one evening in may  to advertise the need to conserve gasoline and rubber mcpherson herself drove a horse and buggy to the angelus temple rubber and other drives were organized and unlimited airtime on her radio station kfsg was given to the office of war information she asked parishioners and other listeners to donate two hours a day for such tasks as rolling bandages so that a soldiers bandage could be changed and let us give our blood to help every one money was raised to provide local military bases with comfortable furnishings and radios newsweek published an article about mcpherson the worlds greatest living minister on july   noting she had collected  pints of blood for the red cross servicemen in her audience are especially honored and the climax of her church services is when she reads the national anthem mcpherson gave visiting servicemen autographed bibles she observed they often had no religious affiliation and did not even own a bible she wrote what a privilege it was to invite the servicemen present in every sunday night meeting to come to the platform where i greeted them gave each one a new testament and knelt in prayer with them for their spiritual needs and god’s guidance and protection on their lives later when the altar call would be given many of these same servicemen would make another trip to the platform publicly to receive jesus christ as their personal savior she insulted adolf hitler and hideki tōjō and became involved in war bond rallies pershing squares victory house in los angeles never saw a bigger crowd mcpherson sold  worth of bonds in one hour on june   breaking all previous records then repeated the performance again on july   the us treasury awarded her a special citation the army made mcpherson an honorary colonel her wartime activities included sermons that linked the church and american patriotism mcpherson spoke to the men in uniform of her belief that military action against the axis powers was long overdue and more so than in almost any war previously she felt that if they did not prevail churches homes and everything precious and dear to the christian would absolutely be destroyed mcphersons embrace of the total war strategy of the united states left her open to some criticism the line between the church as an independent moral authority monitoring government became blurred perceived instead as complicit with that same governance wrongs being done to japanese americans through their internment in relocation camps were being overlooked for example and she refused to allow her denomination to support christians who remained committed pacifists even if conscientious objectors were willing to participate in noncombat roles more was needed church members and leaders had to be willing to take up arms and fight for the united states the pacifist clause which earlier existed was by her proposal voted upon and eliminated by foursquare gospel church leaders deathedit mcphersons grave on september   mcpherson went to oakland california for a series of revivals planning to preach her popular story of my life sermon when mcphersons son went to her hotel room at  the next morning he found her unconscious with pills and a halfempty bottle of capsules nearby she was dead by  it was later discovered she previously called her doctor that morning to complain about feeling ill from the medicine but he was in surgery and could not be disturbed she then phoned another doctor who referred her to yet another physician however mcpherson apparently lost consciousness before the third could be contacted the autopsy did not conclusively determine the cause of mcphersons death she had been taking sleeping pills following numerous health problems – including tropical fever among the pills found in the hotel room was the barbiturate seconal a strong sedative which had not been prescribed for her it was unknown how she obtained them the coroner said she most likely died of an accidental overdose compounded by kidney failure the cause of death is officially listed as unknown given the circumstances there was speculation about suicide but most sources generally agree the overdose was accidental as stated in the coroners report fortyfive thousand people waited in long lines some until  am to file past the evangelist where for three days her body lay in state at the angelus temple within a mileandahalf  m radius of the church police had to double park cars it later took  trucks to transport the  worth of flowers to the cemetery which itself received more telegrammed floral orders than at any time since will rogers death almost  years earlier a foursquare leader noted that to watch the long line pass reverently by her casket and see tears shed by all types of people regardless of class and color helped give understanding to the farreaching influence of her life and ministry an observer marcus bach who was on a spiritual odyssey of personal discovery wrote roberta who had married an orchestra director flew in from new york ma kennedy was at the grave rheba crawford splivalo had returned to say that there was never a greater worker for god than sister a thousand ministers of the foursquare gospel paid their tearful tribute the curious stood by impressed the poor who had always been fed at angelus were there the lost who had been spiritfilled the healed the faithful here they were eager to immortalize the ontario farm girl who loved the lord here they laid the body of sister aimee to rest in the marble sarcophagus guarded by two great angels on sunrise slope  millions of dollars passed through mcphersons hands however when her personal estate was calculated it amounted to  to her daughter roberta went  the remainder to her son rolf by contrast her mother mildred kennedy had a  severance settlement of as much as  in cash and property the foursquare church itself was worth  million mcpherson is buried in forest lawn memorial park cemetery in glendale california following her death the foursquare gospel church denomination was led for  years by her son rolf mcpherson the church claims a membership of over  million worldwide legacy and influenceedit ministryedit mcphersons ministry continued to flourish even in the face of scandal the newspapers which served to propel mcpherson to fame and advertise her message also were used to highlight her faults real and imagined some modern televangelists who transgressed and faded into obscurity because of highprofile news coverage also learned how quickly modern communication media could hurt as well as help them after her death the largely negative aspect of her media image persisted was cultivated and became the dominant factor in defining mcpherson for many in the public today reverend robert p shuler whose caustic view of mcpherson softened over the years wrote he could not figure out why god chose such a person the flaws he observed in mcpherson were by his opinion many yet she ultimately made a positive impact on christianity long lasting and enduring  he recognized her appeal was a combination of identifying with the average citizen as well as an ability to explain the gospel in simple easily understandable terms drawing them irresistibly to her services while great cathedral churches closed their doors on sunday night the crowds pushed through her portals in one everflowing stream he saw her legacy extend far beyond the glamor of hollywood exerting itself through the thousands of ministers she trained and churches planted throughout the world mcpherson together with the alliances she made worked to reshape the evangelical christian faith making it relevant to american culture and personally involving for those in the audience legacyedit uldine utley c  in fresno california  nineyearold uldine utley – became a fervent believer after hearing mcphersons dramatic retelling of the david and goliath story the young girl tearfully gave her life over to christ and dedicated herself to be a little david for the lord and fight goliath with her parents as managers she went on to preach to millions of people and converted many thousands the most notable of these was john sung who would become a major evangelical figure in china utley frequently used the same metaphors as mcpherson referring to christ as the rose of sharon and invoking bride of christ imagery during the great depression years as a child dr edwin louis coles mother attended life bible college and as he grew up cole participated in various angelus temple activities witnessing the miraculous cole went on to found the christian mens network and influenced many including bill mccartney founder of promise keepers pat robertson john maxwell president of injoy ministries kenneth copeland oliver north and chuck norris according biographer matthew avery sutton in the early s it was expected traditional protestantism would give way to rapidly developing new philosophical ideas and sciences that were being widely taught mcpherson contributed immensely to the forestalling of that predicted inevitability liberal christianity which enjoyed strong growth starting in the late th century regarded many of the miracles of jesus to be superstitious interpretations of what actually occurred or metaphors for his teachings mcphersons faithhealing demonstrations instead gave credence to onlookers her claim was true jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever this bible verse of hebrews  as biographer daniel mark epstein noted as per mcpherson meant jesus still had power and could heal as in ancient times and the verse become the motto of her foursquare gospel church sutton wrote conveying it was easy for many people to deny a god who did something  years ago but large crowds of people were now witness to the blind seeing the lame walking and the deaf hearing healings at her services according to epstein from period news sources were occurring faster than the journalists could write them down crowds clamored to reach her altar to experience a new testament conversion that transformed many of their lives even large portions of the secular public admired her the old time gospel message was being dramatically marketed by the most technologically advanced means possible reconstructing it into something far more interesting and desirable than it was previously mcphersons ecumenical approach assisted pentecostals in learning how better to explain their faith in the context of historic church doctrine mainline churches became exposed to the more unusual gifts of the holy spirit they also benefited by borrowing pentecostal revival techniques such as more emotive expression joyful praise worship and testimonials forerunning the charismatic movement mcpherson challenged what was expected from women females as preachers and her status as a divorcee with two failed marriages were of particular concern to many of the fundamentalist churches with which she wanted to work but her success could not be easily ignored meanwhile secular society broadly labeled women as either victorian ladies or whores and she bounced from one category to the other she had her extensive relief charities and along with it titillating scandals atheist charles lee smith remarked publicly of mcpherson just before a debate that she had an extraordinary mind particularly for a woman her continual work at church alliancebuilding finally bore fruit in an official way though she did not live to see it foursquare gospel church leaders were at last able to join the national association of evangelicals in  and from there helped organize the pentecostal world

famous for founding the foursquare church mcpherson has been noted as a pioneer in the use of modern media because she used radio to draw on the growing appeal of popular entertainment in north america and incorporated other forms into her weekly sermons at angelus temple one of the first megachurches in her time she was the most publicized christian evangelist surpassing billy sunday and her other predecessors she conducted public faith healing demonstrations before large crowds testimonies conveyed tens of thousands of people healed mcphersons articulation of the united states as a nation founded and sustained by divine inspiration continues to be echoed by many pastors in churches today news coverage sensationalized her misfortunes with family and church members particularly

her mother mildred known as minnie who worked with the poor in salvation army soup kitchens as a child she would play salvation army with her classmates and at home she would gather a congregation with her dolls giving them a sermon as a teenager mcpherson strayed from her mothers teachings by reading novels and going to movies and dances activities which were strongly disapproved of by both the salvation army and the religion of her father james kennedy a methodist novels though made their way into the methodist church library and with guilty delight mcpherson would read them at the movies she recognized some of her fellow methodist church members she learned too at a local dance she attended that her dancing partner was a presbyterian minister in high school she was taught charles darwins theory of evolution she began to quiz visiting preachers and local pastors about faith and science but was unhappy with the answers she received she wrote to the canadian newspaper family herald and weekly star questioning why taxpayerfunded public schools had courses such as evolution which undermined christianity this was her first exposure to fame as people nationwide responded to her letter while still in high school after her pentecostal conversion mcpherson began a crusade against the concept of evolution beginning a lifelong passion conversionedit robert and aimee semple  while attending a revival meeting in december  aimee met robert james semple a pentecostal missionary from ireland there her faith crisis ended as she decided to dedicate her life to god and made the conversion to pentecostalism as she witnessed the holy spirit moving powerfully marriage and familyedit at that same revival meeting aimee became enraptured not only by the message that robert semple gave but also with robert himself she decided to dedicate her life to both god and robert and after a short courtship they were married on august   in a salvation army ceremony pledging never to allow their marriage to lessen their devotion to god affection for comrades or faithfulness in the army the pairs notion of army was very broad encompassing much more than just the salvation army robert supported them as a foundry worker and preached at the local pentecostal mission together they studied the bible aimee claiming robert taught her all she knew though other observers state she was far more knowledgeable than she let on after a few months they moved to chicago and became part of william durhams full gospel assembly durham earlier had visited the mission where the azusa street revival was taking place returned and applied its teachings under durhams tutelage aimee was discovered to have a unique ability in the interpretation of speaking in tongues translating with stylistic eloquence aimee semple and her second husband harold mcpherson for a time harold traveled with his wife aimee in the gospel caras an itinerant preacher himself helping her to set up tents for revival meetings after embarking on an evangelistic tour to china both contracted malaria robert also contracted dysentery of which he died in hong kong aimee recovered and gave birth to their daughter roberta star semple as a yearold widow on board a ship returning to the united states aimee semple started a sunday school class then held other services as well oftentimes mentioning her late husband in her sermons almost all passengers attended shortly after her recuperation in the united states semple joined her mother minnie working with the salvation army while in new york city she met harold stewart mcpherson an accountant they were married on may   moved to providence rhode island and had a son rolf potter kennedy mcpherson in march  during this time mcpherson felt as though she denied her calling to go preach after struggling with emotional distress and obsessive–compulsive disorder she would fall to weep and pray she felt the call to preach tug at her even more strongly after the birth of rolf then in  she fell seriously ill and mcpherson states she again heard the persistent voice asking her to go preach while in the holding room after a failed operation mcpherson accepted the voices challenge and she suddenly opened her eyes and was able to turn over in bed without pain one spring morning in  her husband returned home from the night shift to discover mcpherson had left him and taken the children a few weeks later a note was received inviting him to join her in evangelistic work aimee semple mcpherson and her third husband david l hutton enjoying their honeymoon breakfast to avoid news publicity they chartered a plane to yuma arizona and were married in a small ceremony hutton assisted in some of mcphersons charity work before their divorce in  her husband later followed mcpherson to take her back home when he saw her though preaching to a crowd he witnessed her transformation into a radiant lovely woman before long he became her fellow worker in christ their house in providence was sold and he joined her in setting up tents for revival meetings and even did some preaching himself throughout their journey food and accommodations were uncertain as they lived out of the gospel car her husband in spite of initial enthusiasm wanted a life that was more stable and predictable eventually he returned to rhode island and around  filed for separation he petitioned for divorce citing abandonment the divorce was granted in  she married again on september   to actor and musician david hutton followed by much drama after which she fainted and fractured her skull while mcpherson was away in europe to recover she was angered to learn hutton was billing himself as aimees man in his cabaret singing act and was frequently photographed with scantily clad women huttons muchpublicized personal scandals were damaging the foursquare gospel church and their leaders credibility with other churches mcpherson and hutton separated in  and divorced on march   mcpherson later publicly repented of the marriage as wrong from the beginning for both theological and personal reasons and therefore rejected nationally known gospel singer homer rodeheaver a more appropriate suitor when he eventually asked for her hand in  early careeredit while married to robert semple the two moved to chicago and became part of william durhams full gospel assembly there aimee was discovered to have a unique ability in the interpretation of speaking in tongues translating with stylistic eloquence the otherwise indecipherable utterances of glossolalia unable to find fulfillment as a housewife in  mcpherson began evangelizing and holding tent revivals across the sawdust trail in the united states and canada after her first successful visits she had little difficulty with acceptance or attendance eager converts filled the pews of local churches which turned many recalcitrant ministers into her enthusiastic supporters frequently she would start a revival meeting in a hall or church and then have to move to a larger building to accommodate the growing crowds when no buildings were suitable she set up a tent which was often filled past capacity she wanted to create the enthusiasm a pentecostal meeting could provide with its amen corner and halleluiah chorus but also to avoid its unbridled chaos as participants started shouting trembling on the floor and speaking in tongues all at once mcpherson organized her meetings with the general public in mind and yet did not wish to quench any who suddenly came into the spirit to this she set up a tarry tent or room away from the general area for any who suddenly started speaking in tongues or display any other holy ghost behavior by which the larger audience might be put off in  mcpherson embarked on a tour of the southern united states in her gospel car and again later in  with her mother mildred kennedy mildred was an important addition to mcphersons ministry and managed everything including the money which gave them an unprecedented degree of financial security their vehicle was a  packard touring car emblazoned with religious slogans standing on the back seat of the convertible mcpherson preached sermons over a megaphone on the road between sermons she would sit in the back seat typing sermons and other religious materials she first traveled up and down the eastern united states then went to other parts of the country by  she had started her own magazine the bridal call for which she wrote many articles about women’s roles in religion she portrayed the link between christians and jesus as a marriage bond along with taking seriously the religious role of women the magazine contributed to transforming pentecostalism from a movement into an ongoing american religious presence  while mcpherson was traveling for her evangelical work she arrived in baltimore where she was first discovered by the newspapers in  after a day of conducting evangelistic services at the lyric opera house baltimore became one of the pivotal points for her early career the crowds in their religious ecstasy were barely kept under control as they gave way to manifestations of the spirit moreover her alleged faith healings now became part of the public record and attendees began to focus on that part of her ministry over all else mcpherson also considered the baltimore revival an important turning point not only for her ministry but in the history of the outpouring of the pentecostal power  career in los angelesedit in late  mcpherson came to los angeles a move many at the time were making for better opportunities minnie kennedy her mother rented the largest hall they could find the seat philharmonic auditorium known then as temple auditorium people waited for hours to get in and mcpherson could hardly reach the pulpit without stepping on someone afterwards grateful attendees of her los angeles meetings built a home for her family and her which included everything from the cellar to a canary bird at this time los angeles had become a popular vacation spot rather than touring the united states to preach her sermons mcpherson stayed in los angeles drawing audiences from a population which had soared from  in  to  people in  and often included many visitors wearied by constant traveling and having nowhere to raise a family mcpherson had settled in los angeles where she maintained both a home and a church mcpherson believed that by creating a church in los angeles her audience would come to her from all over the country this she felt would allow her to plant seeds of the gospel and tourists would take it home to their communities still reaching the masses for several years she continued to travel and raise money for the construction of a large domed church building at  glendale blvd in the echo park area of los angeles the church would be named angelus temple reflecting the roman catholic tradition of the angelus bell calling the faithful to prayer as well its reference to the angels not wanting to take on debt mcpherson located a construction firm which would work with her as funds were raised by faith she started with  the firm indicated it would be enough to carve out a hole for the foundation mcpherson began a campaign in earnest and was able to mobilize diverse groups of people to help fund and build the new church various fundraising methods were used such as selling chairs for temple seating at us  apiece in exchange chairholders got a miniature chair and encouragement to pray daily for the person who would eventually sit in that chair her approach worked to generate enthusiastic giving and to create a sense of ownership and family among the contributors raising more money than she had hoped mcpherson altered the original plans and built a megachurch that would draw many followers throughout the years the endeavor cost contributors around  in actual money spent however this price was low for a structure of its size costs were kept down by donations of building materials and volunteer labor mcpherson sometimes quipped when she first got to california all she had was a car ten dollars and a tambourine enrollment grew exceeding  and was advertised to be the largest single christian congregation in the world according to church records angelus temple received  million visitors within the first seven years mcpherson intended the angelus temple as both a place of worship and an ecumenical center for persons of all christian faiths to meet and build alliances a wide range of clergy and laypeople consisted of methodists baptists the salvation army presbyterians episcopalians adventists quakers roman catholics mormons and even secular civic leaders who came to the angelus temple they were welcomed and many made their way to her podium as guest speakers eventually even rev robert p shuler a oncerobust mcpherson critic was featured as a guest preacher because pentecostalism was not popular in the united states during the s mcpherson avoided the label she practiced speakingintongues and faith healing within her services but kept the former to a minimum in sermons to appease mainstream audiences discarded medical fittings from persons faithhealed during her services which included crutches wheelchairs and other paraphernalia were gathered for display in a museum area as evidence of her early influence by the salvation army mcpherson adopted a theme of lighthouses for the satellite churches referring to the parent church as the salvation navy this was the beginning of mcpherson working to plant foursquare gospel churches around the country charitable workedit mcpherson left prepares christmas food baskets about  mcpherson strove to develop a church organization which could not only provide for the spiritual but also the physical needs of the distressed though she fervently believed and preached the imminent return of jesus christ she had no idea of how soon that second coming might be two thoughts pervaded the mind of most devout pentecostals of the time jesus is coming therefore how can i get ready and how can i help others to get ready for mcpherson part of the answer was to mobilize her temple congregation and everyone she could reach through radio telephone and word of mouth to get involved in substantial amounts of charity and social work true christianity is not only to be good but to do good she preached the charities and beneficiary department collected donations for all types of humanitarian relief to include a japanese disaster as well as a german relief fund men released from prison were found jobs by a brotherhood a sisterhood was created as well sewing baby clothing for impoverished mothers branch churches elsewhere in the country were likewise encouraged to follow the angelus temples example even people who considered mcphersons theology almost ridiculous helped out because they saw her church as the best way to assist their community in june  after confirming reports of an earthquake in santa barbara mcpherson immediately left the parsonage and interrupted a broadcast at a nearby radio station she took over the microphone from the startled singer and requested food blankets clothing or whatever listeners could give for emergency supplies to assist nearby santa barbara as the red cross met to discuss and organize aid mcphersons second convoy had already arrived at the troubled city in  after a dam failed and the ensuing flood left up to  dead in its wake mcphersons church led the relief effort later in  an earthquake struck and devastated long beach mcpherson quickly arranged for volunteers to be on the scene with blankets coffee and doughnuts men wait in line to enter aimee semple mcphersons angelus temple free dining hall  commissary located at  w temple street at the time she was married to david hutton and all branding reflected his last name drawing from her childhood experience with the salvation army in  mcpherson opened a commissary at angelus temple which was devised to assist the needy on a much larger formalized scale the commissary was virtually the only place in town a person could get food clothing and blankets with no questions asked it was open  hours a day seven days a week and became active in creating soup kitchens free clinics and other charitable activities as the great depression wore on she fed an estimated  million people when the government shut down the free schoollunch program mcpherson took it over her policy of giving first and investigating afterward allowed waste and a certain number of deadbeats to leech off the program but it alleviated suffering on an epic scale mcpherson got the fire and police departments to assist in distribution doctors physicians and dentists were persuaded to staff her free clinic that trained  nurses to help treat children and the elderly she encouraged individuals and companies of all types to donate supplies food cash or labor to prevent the power from being turned off to homes of overdue accounts during the winter a  cash reserve was set up with the utility company many people who otherwise would have nothing to do with the angelus temple would receive a call from mcpherson and then loot their mansion closets or company stores for something to give the yellow cab company donated a large building and in the first month  people received meals there laboring under a sign everybody and anybody is somebody to jesus volunteer workers filled commissary baskets with an assortment of food and other items as well as foursquare gospel literature and handed them out even a complete kit designed to care for newborn babies was available a reporter wrote he had always thought the breadline was a drab colorless scar on our civilization but of the angelus temple commissary he observed was the warm garment of sympathy and christian succor a note which reflects the sentiment of many of those who received assistance was left in june  at mcphersons virtual gravesite my grandpa always talked about when he was a kid he and his family moved to california from missouri during the depression and his family was starving and they met you and you gave them a bag of vegetables and some money he never forgot it anonymous establishing an employment bureau as well mcpherson desired to help the discouraged husband the despondent widow or the little mother who wants extra work to bear the burden of a sick husband she expected everyone in her temple to be involved let us ever strive to lighten our brothers load and dry the tears of a sister race creed or status make no difference we are all one in the eyes of the lord she encouraged members to think of the commissary as widening the spirituality of the whole church line of unemployed men getting meals at dining hall run by aimee semple mcpherson  in  the commissary was raided by police to allegedly locate a still used to make brandy out of donated apricots some sauerkraut and salad oil were purportedly observed leaking from their respective storage areas as a consequence the commissary was briefly shut down the press got involved and the public demanded an investigation since no one really wanted to stall the temples charity efforts the acceptable solution was to replace the immediate management the staff was let go and students from her foursquare gospel churchs life bible college filled in the newspaper media generally cynical of the temple and in particular of mcpherson recognized the excellent features of that organizations efforts and the faults of the angelus temple are outweighed by its virtues mcpherson issued a statement declaring they have clashed loud their cymbals and blown their trumpets about a still and some sauerkraut our work is still before us ifanybody abused his trust it must not happen again as mcpherson tried to avoid administrative delays in categorizing the deserving from the undeserving her temple commissary became known as one of the regions most effective and inclusive aid institutions few soup kitchens lasted more than several months but mcphersons remained open even as she transformed herself into a fashionable blonde hollywood socialite mcphersons vigor and practicality for social activism did not change she loved organizing big projects a  survey indicated the angelus temple assisted more family units than any other public or private institution in the city because her programs aided nonresidents as well such as migrants from other states and mexico she ran afoul of california state regulations though temple guidelines were later officially adjusted to accommodate those policies helping families in need was a priority regardless of their place of residence actor anthony quinn recalls this was all during the height of the depression when hunger and poverty permeated america many mexicans were terrified of appealing for county help because most of them were in the country illegally when in distress they were comforted by the fact that they could call one of aimees branches at any time of the night there they would never be asked any of the embarrassing questions posed by the authorities the fact that they were hungry or in need of warm clothing was enough no one even asked if they belonged to aimees church or not ministryedit style of ministryedit in august  and away from los angeles mcpherson decided to charter a plane so she would not miss giving her sunday sermon aware of the opportunity for publicity she arranged for at least  followers and members of the press to be present at the airport the plane failed after takeoff and the landing gear collapsed sending the nose of the plane into the ground mcpherson boarded another plane and used the experience as the narrative of an illustrated sunday sermon called the heavenly airplane the stage in angelus temple was set up with two miniature planes and a skyline that looked like los angeles in this sermon mcpherson described how the first plane had the devil for the pilot sin for the engine and temptation as the propeller the other plane however was piloted by jesus and would lead one to the holy city the skyline shown on stage the temple was filled beyond capacity angelus temple completed in  is the center of the international church of the foursquare gospel founded by mcpherson in  angelus temple was designated a national historic landmark it is still in active use on another occasion she described being pulled over by a police officer calling the sermon arrested for speeding dressed in a traffic cops uniform she sat in the saddle of a police motorcycle earlier placed on the stage and revved the siren one author in attendance insisted she actually drove the motorcycle with its deafening roar across the access ramp to the pulpit slammed on the brakes then raised a whitegloved hand to shout stop youre speeding to hell since mcpherson gave some of her sermons more than once and with variations the possibility existed both versions might be true mcpherson employed a small group of artists electricians decorators and carpenters who built the sets for each sundays service religious music was played by an orchestra mcpherson also worked on elaborate sacred operas one production the iron furnace based on the book of exodus told of god’s deliverance as the israelites fled slavery in egypt some hollywood movie stars even assisted with obtaining costumes from local studios the cast was large perhaps as many as  people but so elaborate and expensive it was presented only one time rehearsals for the various productions were timeconsuming and mcpherson did not tolerate any nonsense though described as always kind and loving mcpherson demanded respect regarding the divine message the sacred operas and her other works were designed to convey aimee semple mcpherson surrounded by massed choirs at angelus temple for a musical requiem in  even though mcpherson condemned theater and film as the devils workshop its secrets and effects were coopted she became the first woman evangelist to adopt the whole technique of the moving picture star mcpherson desired to avoid the dreary church service where by obligation parishioners would go to fulfill some duty by being present in the pew she wanted a sacred drama that would compete with the excitement of vaudeville and the movies the message was serious but the tone more along the lines of a humorous musical comedy animals were frequently incorporated and mcpherson the once farm girl knew how to handle them mcpherson gave up to  sermons a week and the lavish sunday night service attracted the largest crowds extra trolleys and police were needed to help route the traffic through echo park to and from angelus temple to finance the angelus temple and its projects collections were taken at every meeting often with the admonishment no coins please mcpherson preached a conservative gospel but used progressive methods taking advantage of radio movies and stage acts advocacy for womens rights was on the rise including womens suffrage through the th amendment she attracted some women associated with modernism but others were put off by the contrast between her different theories by accepting and using such new media outlets mcpherson helped integrate them into people’s daily lives sister mcpherson used the media to her advantage as she became the first modern celebrity preacher minister aimee semple mcpherson and a group of tambourine players leading a service at angelus temple she was very innovative in producing weekly dramas illustrating religious themes the battle between fundamentalists and modernists escalated after world war i with many modernists seeking less conservative religious faiths fundamentalists generally believed their religious faith should influence every aspect of their lives mcpherson sought to eradicate modernism and secularism in homes churches schools and communities she developed a strong following in what mcpherson termed the foursquare gospel by blending contemporary culture with religious teachings mcpherson was entirely capable of sustaining a protracted intellectual discourse as her bible students and debate opponents will attest but she believed in preaching the gospel with simplicity and power so as to not confuse the message her distinct voice and visual descriptions created a crowd excitement bordering on hysteria the appeal of mcphersons  or so revival events from  to  surpassed any touring event of theater or politics ever presented in american history neither houdini nor teddy roosevelt had such an audience nor pt barnum her one to fourweek meetings typically overflowed any building she could find to hold them she broke attendance records recently set by billy sunday and frequently used his temporary tabernacle structures in which to hold some of her meetings her revivals were often standingroom only one such revival was held in a boxing ring with the meeting before and after the match throughout the boxing event she walked about with a sign reading knock out the devil in san diego california the city called in the national guard and other branches of the armed forces to control a revival crowd over  people she became one of the most photographed persons of her time she enjoyed the publicity and quotes on almost every subject were sought from her by journalists faith healing ministryedit main article faith healing ministry of aimee semple mcpherson mcphersons ability to draw crowds was also greatly assisted by her apparently successful faith healing presentations almost by accident she discovered when she laid hands on sick or injured persons they got well one early mcpherson biographer nancy barr mavity described the healing power beyond her conscience sic control and profoundly troubling however a phenomenon familiar to the psychiatrist although none the less sic mysterious  during a  revival meeting in corona long island new york a young woman in the advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis was brought to the altar by friends mcpherson would have preferred to pray with her privately however the woman insisted upon immediate prayer mcpherson laid hands on her and prayed before the gathered parishioners the woman walked out of the church without crutches mcphersons reputation as a faith healer rapidly became known and the sick and injured people came to her by the tens of thousands the faith healing ministry of aimee semple mcpherson was extensively written about in the news media and was a large part of her early career legacy no one has ever been credited by secular witnesses with anywhere near the numbers of faith healings attributed to mcpherson especially during the years  to  over time though she almost withdrew from the faithhealing aspect of her services since it was overwhelming other areas of her ministry scheduled weekly and monthly healing sessions nevertheless remained highly popular with the public until her death in  the foursquare churchedit foursquare church logo eventually mcphersons church evolved into its own denomination and became known as the international church of the foursquare gospel usually referenced as the foursquare church foursquare is an alternative word for full gospel a term used by pentecostals referencing the nature of christs character that he was savior baptizer with the holy spirit healer and sooncoming king the four main beliefs were the first being christs ability to transform individuals lives through the act of salvation the second focused on a holy baptism which includes receiving power to glorify and exalt christ in a practical way the third was divine healing newness of life for both body and spirit and the fourth was gospeloriented heed to the premillennial return of jesus christ mcpherson published the weekly foursquare crusader along with her monthly magazine bridal call she began broadcasting on radio in the early s on a sunday morning in april  the rockridge radio station in oakland ca offered her some radio time and she became the first woman to preach a sermon over the wireless telephone with the opening of foursquare gospelowned kfsg on february   she became the second woman granted a broadcast license by the department of commerce the federal agency that supervised broadcasting in the early s mcpherson racially integrated her tent meetings and church services on one occasion as a response to mcphersons ministry and angelus temple being integrated ku klux klan members were in attendance but after the service hoods and robes were found on the ground in nearby echo park she is also credited with helping many hispanic ministries in los angeles mcpherson traveling about the country holding widely popular revival meetings and filling local churches with converts was one thing settling permanently into their city caused concern among some local los angeles churches though she shared many of their fundamentalist beliefs such as divine inspiration of the bible the classical trinity virgin birth of jesus historical reality of christs miracles bodily resurrection of christ and the atoning purpose of his crucifixion the presentation of lavish sermons and an effective faithhealing ministry presented by a female divorcee whom thousands adored and about whom newspapers continuously wrote was unexpected moreover the temple especially the women had a look and style uniquely theirs they would emulate mcphersons style and dress and a distinct angelus temple uniform came into existence a white dress with a navy blue cape thrown over it men were more discreet wearing suits her voice projected over the powerful stateoftheart kfsg radio station and heard by hundreds of thousands became the most recognized in the western united states mcpherson preaching at the newly built angelus temple in  her messages showcased the love of god redemption and the joys of service and heaven contrasting sharply with the fireandbrimstone style of sermon delivery popular with many of her peers her illustrated sermons attracted criticism from some clergy members because they thought it turned the gospel message into mundane theater and entertainment divine healing as mcpherson called it was claimed by many pastors to be a unique dispensation granted only for apostolic times rival radio evangelist reverend robert p shuler published a pamphlet entitled mcphersonism which purported that her most spectacular and advertised program was out of harmony with gods word debates such as the bogardmcpherson debate in  drew further attention to the controversy but none could really argue effectively against mcphersons results the new developing assemblies of god denomination pentecostal as mcpherson was for a time worked with her but they encouraged separation from established protestant faiths mcpherson resisted trends to isolate as a denomination and continued her task of coalitionbuilding among evangelicals mcpherson worked hard to attain ecumenical vision of the faith and while she participated in debates avoided pitched rhetorical battles that divided so many in christianity she wanted to work with existing churches on projects and to share with them her visions and beliefs assisting in her passion was the speedy establishment of life bible college adjacent to the angeles temple ministers trained there were originally intended to go nationally and worldwide to all denominations and share her newly defined foursquare gospel a wellknown methodist minister frank thompson who never had the pentecostal experience was persuaded to run the college and he taught the students the doctrine of john wesley mcpherson and others meanwhile infused them with pentecostal ideals for about a year antonia frederick futterer suggested by los angeles times as the inspiration for steven spielbergs film character indiana jones was also a facility member mcphersons efforts eventually led pentecostals which were previously unconventional and on the periphery of christianity into the mainstream of american evangelicalism life in the media spotlightedit media relationsedit by early  mcpherson had become one of the most charismatic and influential women and ministers of her time her fame equaled to name a few charles lindbergh johnny weissmuller jack dempsey babe ruth ty cobb knute rockne bobby jones louise brooks and rudolph valentino she was a major american phenomenon who along with some other highprofile preachers of the time unlike hollywood celebrities could be admired by their adoring public without apparently compromising their souls according to carey mcwilliams she had become more than just a household word she was a folk hero and a civic institution an honorary member of the fire and police departments a patron saint of the service clubs an official spokesman for the community on problems grave and frivolous she was influential in many social educational and political areas mcpherson made personal crusades against anything that she felt threatened her christian ideals including the drinking of alcohol and teaching evolution in schools mcpherson became a strong supporter of william jennings bryan during the  scopes trial in which john scopes was tried for illegally teaching evolution at a dayton tennessee school bryan and mcpherson had worked together in the angelus temple and they believed darwinism had undermined students morality according to the new yorker mcpherson said evolution is the greatest triumph of satanic intelligence in  years of devilish warfare against the hosts of heaven it is poisoning the minds of the children of the nation she sent bryan a telegram saying ten thousand members of angelus temple with her millions of radio church membership send grateful appreciation of your lionhearted championship of the bible against evolution and throw our hats in the ring with you she organized an allnight prayer service a massive church meeting preceded by a bible parade through los angeles politicsedit while her mother mildred kennedy was a registered democrat no one was certain of mcphersons registration she endorsed herbert hoover over franklin d roosevelt but enthusiastically threw her support behind the latter and his social programs when he was elected into office she was a patron of organized labor preaching a gangsters money was no more unclean than the dollars of the man who amasses his millions from underpaid factory workers she was more cautious though when labor strikes resulted in violent uprisings she saw in them the possible activities of communism which sought to infiltrate labor unions and other organizations mcpherson intensely disliked communism and its derivatives as they sought to rule without god their ultimate goal she believed was to remove christianity from the earth mcphersons opinion of fascism fared no better its totalitarian rule was wrongly justified by claiming to represent the power of god mcpherson did not align herself consistently with any broad conservative or liberal political agenda instead she explained if christianity occupied a central place in national life and if the components of god home school and government were kept together everything else would fall into place remove any of these she warned and civilization topples crumbles current foursquare gospel church leaders qualify the evangelists views mcpherson’s passion to see america sustained in spiritual health which compelled her quest to see the church influence government must be interpreted in light of the political and religious climate of the s s and s it is not accurate to draw a parallel between today’s extreme fundamentalist rightwing christianity and the style or focus of sister mcpherson she was also among the first prominent christian ministers to defend the establishment of a jewish homeland in palestine she related that when christ returns the jews would receive him their suffering will end and they will establish at jerusalem a kingdom more wonderful than the world has known reported kidnappingedit disappearance from venice beachedit main article reported kidnapping of aimee semple mcpherson minnie

venice beach to swim soon after arriving mcpherson was nowhere to be found it was thought she had drowned searchers combed the beach and nearby area but could not locate her body the angelus temple received letters and calls claiming knowledge of mcpherson including demands for ransom mcpherson sightings occurred around the country often in widely divergent locations many miles apart on the same day as a precaution the ransom notes were sent to the police who investigated at least one of them mildred kennedy though regarded the messages as hoaxes believing her daughter dead as the angelus temple prepared for a memorial service commemorating mcphersons death kennedy received a phone call from douglas arizona her daughter was alive the distraught mcpherson was resting in a douglas

distance of  miles  km around  am she reached agua prieta sonora a mexican border town and collapsed near a house there she was assisted by the residents and finally taken to adjacent douglas return to los angelesedit after leaving douglas mcpherson was greeted at the los angeles train station by – people more than for almost any other personage the parade back to the temple even elicited a greater turnout than president woodrow wilsons visit to los angeles in  attesting to her popularity and the growing influence of mass media entertainment already incensed over mcphersons influential public stance on evolution and the bible most of the chamber of commerce and some other civic leaders saw the event as gaudy display nationally embarrassing to the city many los angeles area churches were also annoyed the story received nationwide coverage then speculations together with alleged witnesses began to emerge that her disappearance might have been caused by other than the kidnapping event mcpherson described against the wishes of her mother who thought the press would continue to unfavorably exploit the story mcpherson decided for vindication and presented her complaint in court a grand jury inquiry convened to determine if enough evidence could be found to indict any kidnappers however pressured by various influential community groups the court instead intensely investigated mcpherson her family and acquaintances to determine if the kidnapping was fabricated district attorney asa keyes led the prosecution against her he was known for winning convictions but six persons he sent to prison were found to be innocent and pardoned by the state governor grand jury inquiryedit the grand jury inquiries were first convened on july   adjourned and reconvened holding sessions through the summer of  accompanied by intense media interest the proceedings were supposed to be secret as per california law though the los angeles court spoke about it to the newspapers issues of trial by media and court of public opinion were apparent as much of the proclaimed evidence against mcpherson came from reporters who featured it in their news articles and passed it on to the police mcpherson also eschewed secrecy and freely used her radio station to broadcast her side of the story evidence and testimonies were hotly debated by an evenly divided public on november  the case was determined to be moved to jury trial set for midjanuary  along with mcpherson and her mother several other defendants were charged in the inquiry if convicted the counts added up to maximum prison time of  years various speculations were proffered by the news media and prosecution as to the reason for mcphersons disappearance the one they settled on most strongly was she ran off with an exemployee kenneth ormiston she was accused of staying with him in a california resort town cottage until may  the time frame of ormistons seaside cottage rental coincided with the first  days of her disappearance however a missing threeweek period afterwards was not accounted for with any evidence in court by the prosecution in response the evangelist maintained all along without changing anything in her story that she was taken held captive by the kidnappers and escaped as she originally described as the prosecution tried to break down her story defense witnesses corroborated her assertions  or mcpherson herself demonstrated how the disputed parts were plausible in contrast the prosecutions case developed serious credibility issues witnesses changed their testimonies and evidence often had suspicious origins or was mishandled while in custody finally on january   ormiston identified elizabeth tovey a nurse from seattle washington as his female companion and the woman who stayed with him at the seaside cottage all charges against mcpherson and associated parties were dropped by the court for the lack of evidence on january   after the case dismissaledit regardless of the courts decision months of unfavorable press reports fixed in much of the publics mind a certainty of mcphersons wrongdoing the newspapers had a vested interest in keeping the controversy going since it generated huge sales the bulk of the investigation against mcpherson was funded by los angelesarea newspapers at an estimated amount of  some supporters thought mcpherson should have insisted on the jury trial and clear her name the grand jury inquiry concluded while enough evidence did not exist to try her it did not indicate her story was true with its implication of kidnappers still at large court costs to mcpherson were estimated to be as high as  a jury trial could take months mcpherson moved on to other projects in  she published a book about her version of the kidnapping in the service of the king the story of my life various influential individuals offered their opinions on the inquiry in a letter to the los angeles times a few months after the case was dropped the reverend robert p shuler stated perhaps the most serious thing about this whole situation is the seeming loyalty of thousands to this leader in the face of her evident and positively proven guilt hl mencken noted journalist satirist cultural critic and scholar and an ideological opponent of mcpherson opposite each other in the  scopes monkey trial also commented he wrote that since many of that towns residents acquired their ideas of the true the good and the beautiful from the movies and newspapers los angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her claims of extramarital affairsedit during her lifetimeedit numerous allegations of illicit love affairs were often directed against mcpherson suspected lovers generally denied involvement for example kenneth ormiston a married man with a small son could have profited immensely from an exposé about himself and mcpherson whether the two had a good working relationship and were friendly with each other was not disputed during the  kidnapping grand jury trial reporters and investigators tried to link him amorously to mcpherson ormiston told newspapers his name connected in such a way to the evangelist was a gross insult to a noble and sincere woman mcpherson was often the target of numerous unsubstantiated sexually related allegations as reported by the los angeles times june   this photograph depicts the evangelist reading a note demanding  else nude motion pictures of her and a friend would be publicly released when inquired about it in an unrelated interview later that year she tersely stated nude pictures of her did not exist because none were ever taken alarmed by her rapidly changing style of dress and involvement with hollywood and its worldly lifestyle in  an angelus temple official hired detectives to shadow mcpherson through her windows the detectives frequently saw mcpherson staying up until the early morning hours composing songs drafting sacred operas and scribbling diagrams of her illustrated sermons they were looking for evidence of her indiscretions but found nothing no confirmation of adulterous misconduct with perhaps exception of her third marriage as a violation of church tenets was ever presented mcpherson herself aware of numerous accusations leveled at her throughout her career responded only to a small fraction of them conveying the only thing she had time for was preaching jesus posthumouslyedit posthumously unsubstantiated allegations of extramarital affairs continued to emerge this time by those who stated to have been her partner claims not mentioned by them or others while she was still alive canadian journalist gordon sinclair implied such a claim in his  autobiography will the real gordon sinclair please stand up sinclair stated he worked on a story with mcpherson and during one of those times in  the incident purportedly occurred sinclair alluded to a sexual dalliance with mcpherson one afternoon along with some gin and ginger thirty years after her death another claim by comedian milton berle in a  autobiography alleges a brief affair with the evangelist in his book titled milton berle an autobiography berle asserts he met mcpherson at the shrine auditorium in los angeles where both were doing a charity show biographer matthew avery sutton commented berle a notorious womanizer whose many tales of scandalous affairs were not always true claimed to have had sex with mcpherson on this and one other occasion both during a year when mcpherson was often ill and bedridden sutton noted that berles story of a crucifix in mcphersons bedroom was not consistent with the coolness of pentecostalcatholic relations during that era another book by milton berle laughingly yours which had autobiographical content that was published in  while mcpherson was still alive did not have this claim author raymond l cox states mrs mcphersons daughter roberta salter of new york told me mother never had an apartment in her life by  she kept herself securely chaperoned to guard against such allegations during  the evangelists appearances and whereabouts can be traced almost every day she was incapacitated with illness a full five months of that year and there is no place on her schedule as reported in her publications and church and travel records for the benefit berle alleged besides roberta also told cox mother never did a benefit in her life she had her own charities later life and careeredit mcpherson surrounded by flowers cutting into angelus temple cake  not one for settling into a predictable routine she used her birthday national holidays and other events as themes for church services and gala festivities after fallout with pressedit following her heyday in the s mcpherson carried on with her ministry but fell out of favor with the press they once dubbed her the miracle worker or miracle woman reporting extensively on her faithhealing demonstrations but now were anxious to relay every disturbance in her household to the headlines her developing difficulties with her mother mildred kennedy were starting to take the front page yet mcpherson emerged from the kidnapping nationally famous as much as  of the population in los angeles held membership in her temple for a time movie studios competed with each other offering mcpherson longterm contracts believing that talking pictures had the potential to transform christianity mcpherson explored hollywood culture and appeared in newsreels alongside other famous individuals such as mary pickford frances perkins and franklin d roosevelt she lost weight cut and dyed her hair began to wear makeup and jewelry and became stylish and wellattired a critic wrote mcpherson can outdress the hollywood stars the solicitation of fame justified to draw audiences to her and hence to christ was more than some in her church organization could accept they yearned for sister aimee in the old time dress referring to her previous trademarked uniform of a navy cape over a white servants dress both purchased inexpensively in bargain basements other members though loved it and her angelus temple services were as popular as ever and remained so throughout her life unless parishioners arrived to a service early frequently they could not get in all seats were taken now that she could afford it mcpherson thought as well she wanted her apparel and display to be the best she could present to jesus in early  mcpherson immediately set out on a vindication tour visiting various cities and taking advantage of the publicity her kidnapping story created to preach the gospel her visit to new york in foxfurs and a finely trimmed yellow suit was noted in the society pages she visited even nightclubs to include a famous speakeasy in new york texas guinan’s three hundred club on th street while mcpherson sipped water at her table guinan asked if she would speak a few words to the patrons delighted mcpherson stood and addressed the jazzed and boozy crowd behind all these beautiful clothes behind these good times in the midst of your lovely buildings and shops and pleasures there is another life there is something on the other side “what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul” with all your getting and playing and good times do not forget you have a lord take him into your hearts the unexpected speech that did not judge and had a conciliatory tone between them and the divine earned a thoughtful moment of silence from the crowd then an applause that went on for much longer than the speech took the revelers were invited to hear her preach at the glad tidings tabernacle on rd street the visits to speakeasies and nightclubs added to mcphersons notoriety newspapers reported heavily on them rumors erroneously conveyed she was drinking smoking and dancing and her mother along with some other church members did not understand mcphersons strategy of tearing down barriers between the secular and religious world between the sinner and the saved problems with mildred kennedyedit without mildred kennedys conservative financial management replacement administrators embarked on a spread of ambitious projects that often failed an example of this was lake tahoe lot deals of which the cover of an alleged prospectus describes not enough parcels of land were purchased and the subsequent lawsuit brought by investors drew unfavorable publicity and the attention of the district attorneys office in the summer of  mildred kennedy mcphersons mother left the angelus temple in an attempt to curtail her daughters influence and officially transfer more power to herself kennedy initiated a staffmember vote of confidence against mcpherson but lost the two had heatedly argued over management polices and mcphersons changing personal dress and appearance for similar reasons  members of the choir left as well the choir could be replaced however kennedys financial and administrative skills had been of crucial importance in growing mcphersons ministry from tent revivals to satellite churches and maintaining its current activities in the temple a series of less able management staff replaced kennedy and the temple became involved in various questionable projects such as hotel building cemetery plots and land sales accordingly the angelus temple plummeted deep into debt in response to the difficulties kennedy came back in late  but because of continued serious disagreements with mcpherson tendered her resignation on july   the following month mcpherson suffered a physical and nervous breakdown for  months she was absent from the pulpit diagnosed in part with acute acidosis resurrecting her careeredit when she gained strength and returned she introduced with renewed vigor her moving attar of roses sermon based on the song of solomon with its rose of sharon as the mystical body of christ while journalists attending her sunday illustrated sermons assumed her language was fit only for slapstick or sentimental entertainment scholars who have studied her work for bible students and small prayer groups found instead the complex discourse of neoplatonic interpretation the old testament book the song of solomon for example she had hundreds of pages written about it each different from one another as snowflakes the october –  revival in boston started out sluggishly and many predicted its failure a los angeles newspaper ran headlines of the flop and expected more of the same in the days to come on opening night mcpherson spoke to fewer than  persons in the seat sports arena and safety pins and rubber bands abundantly cluttered the collection baskets the city had large populations of unitarians episcopalians and catholics venerable denominations traditionally hostile to a pentecostal or fundamentalist message afterwards from her hotel room mcpherson known to be a sports fan asked for the afternoons world series scores and a boston herald reporter sent her a copy of the sunday edition the next day the bring back the bible to boston campaigns tone shifted as mcpherson took greater control and attendance climbed sharply a reporter took note of mcphersons stage presence different from any other evangelist who spoke there gesturing with her white bible for effect as well as preaching answering him as to why she presented a dramatic sermon she stated our god is a dramatic god rolling back the red sea elijah on the mountaintop the crucifixion the resurrection his ascension tongues of fire on the day of pentecost the final day of afternoon and evening services had  persons attending the stadium was full and more than  had to be turned away a total of  people attended the meetings breaking historic attendance records of any nine days of revival services in boston her revival in new york city was not very fruitful as her sensationalistic reputation preceded her the third marriage to david hutton rumored romances and her kidnapping was what its press and citizens wanted to hear about therefore after a brief pause in new york and washington dc she went on philadelphia and other cities traveling to  of them in  states speaking to as much as  of the entire population of the united states a full crew of musicians scene designers and costumers accompanied mcpherson in this her last national revival tour between september  and december   two million persons heard  sermons many more were reached by  radio stations the boston evening traveler newspaper reported aimees religion is a religion of joy there is happiness in it her voice is easy to listen to she does not appeal to the brain and try to hammer religion into the heads of her audience rather she appeals to the hearts of her hearers she radiates friendliness she creates an atmosphere that is warming she is persuasive rather than forceful gracious and kindly rather than compelling fundamentally she takes the whole bible literally from cover to cover nevertheless she was not a radical literalist in an informal meeting with some harvard students mcpherson told them that genesis allowed great latitude of interpretation and that neither she nor the bible insisted the world was created only  years ago in another meeting with students she heard their assertion the teachings of christ have outlived their usefulness education science and cold reasoning were the new saviors of the world thus compelled mcpherson decided to travel and look at the world with new eyes in  mcpherson embarked on a worldwide sixmonth discovery tour to examine the social religious and economic climates of many countries at one point it was earlier reported she wanted to study the womens movement in connection with the campaign for the independence of india and was anxious to have a chat with mahatma gandhi she received an invitation from him and he gave her a sari made from threads woven from his simple spinning wheel impressed with gandhi and his ideas mcpherson thought he might secretly lean towards christianity his dedication possibly coming from catching a glimpse of the cleansing lifting strengthening power of the nazarene other highlights included traversing barefoot in myanmar the lengthy stone path to the great pagoda a goldcovered ft tiered tower enshrining relics of four buddhas which caught and reflected the rays of the sun a vision of breathtaking glory she heard benito mussolini speak in italy and fretted war would again ensue in the rain at verdun france she sat on a wrecked military vehicle in mournful contemplation of the hundreds of thousands who died on the stilluncleared battlefield white bleached bones of the fallen poked out of the earth and nearby laborers toiled carefully at their dangerous iron harvest collecting old munitions for disposal in mid a delegation who had been involved with the  azusa street mission revivals including emma cotton asked if they could use the angelus temple for their th anniversary celebration the original mission building was demolished and its land unavailable african american evangelist emma cotton and mcpherson therefore organized a series of meetings which also marked her enthusiastic reidentification with the pentecostal movement mcphersons experiments of hollywood celebrity ambitions coexisting with her ministry were not as successful as she hoped alliances with other church groups were failing or no longer in effect and she searched for ways to start again therefore she looked to her spiritual origins and allowed for the possibility of reintroducing even the more alarming aspects of the pentecostal experience into her public meetings temple officials were concerned the azusa people might bring in some wildfire and holy rollerism mcpherson indicated she would turn hand springs with them as needed to see the power of god manifest the azusa street revival commemoration events brought numbers of black leaders to her pulpit the original attendees of the azusa revivals filled the angelus temple along with every ethnic minority the saints who were once smelted together with the fires of pentecost were being reunited rewelded and rejuvenated mcpherson recommitted herself to the dissemination of classic pentecostalism and her concern now was that foursquaredom was in the danger of becoming too churchy for the first time since the temple opened mcpherson began to publicly deliver some of her messages in tongues mcpherson traversed the line between cold formality and wildfire and now decided it was easier to cool down a hot fanatic than to resuscitate a corpse future meetings to celebrate the azusa street revivals included guest charles h mason a founder of the churches of god in christ mason an azusa leader was also one of the most significant african american religious figures in united states history and was frequently hosted at the angelus temple roberta star semple left mcphersons daughter aimee semplemcpherson middle and rheba crawford splivalo assistant pastorright at a parade in  problems with the templeedit also in  mcpherson reassigned staff responsibilities in an effort to address the temples financial difficulties this together with other unresolved issues accelerated simmering tensions among various staff members rumors circulated that angel of broadway charismatic evangelist rheba crawford splivalo who had been working extensively with mcpherson for several years planned to take the angelus temple from her mcpherson asked splivalo to leave town in the course of the staff controversy mcphersons lawyer issued a strongly worded press release that upset roberta star semple mcphersons daughter and led her to initiate a  lawsuit against him for slander splivalo also sued mcpherson for  because of alleged statements calling her a ‘jezebel and a judas’ and unfit to stand in the angelus temple pulpit the two lawsuits filed by semple and splivalo were not related but mcpherson did not see it that way she saw both as part of the temple takeover plot mcphersons mother was also involved and sided with semple her granddaughter making unflattering statements about mcpherson to the press in these charged circumstances mcphersons defense of herself and her lawyer in a public trial was dramatic and theatrical she testified tearfully with swoons and faints about how her daughter conspired with others against her her daughters lawyer meanwhile mocked mcpherson by imitating her mannerisms and making faces at her the trial did much to estrange mcpherson from her daughter the judge ruled for semple giving a  judgment in her favor semple then moved to new york splivalo and the temple settled their suit out of court for the cause of religion and the good of the community with kennedy semple and splivalo gone the temple lost much of its talented leadership however mcpherson found a competent and firm administrator in giles knight who was able to bring the temple out of debt dispose of the  or so lawsuits and eliminate the more spurious projects he sequestered mcpherson allowed her to receive only a few personal visitors and carefully regulated her activities outside the temple this period was one of unprecedented creativity for mcpherson no longer distracted by waves of reporters reams of lawsuits and innumerable individuals demanding her attention she became very accomplished in her illustrative sermon style of gospel preaching the irreligious charlie chaplin would secretly attend her services enjoying her sermons she later met and consulted with chaplin on ways to improve her presentations mcpherson who earlier blared across newspaper headlines as many as three times a week in one alleged scandal or another had her public image much improved her adversary reverend robert p shuler who previously attacked her by radio magazine pulpit and pamphlet proclaimed aimees missionary work was the envy of methodists he also expressed his support of her foursquare church application admittance into national association of evangelicals for united action in  her efforts at making interracial revival a reality at angelus temple continued she welcomed blacks into the congregation and pulpit while race riots burned detroit in  mcpherson publicly converted the notorious black former heavyweight champion jack johnson on the temple stage and embraced him “as he raised his hand in worship” war yearsedit views on waredit pacifism which was a component of pentecostalism was evaluated by the foursquare gospel church in the s with official statements and documents which were further revised by mcpherson a press quote attributed to mcpherson in reference to mahatma gandhi appears to explore the concept i want to incorporate the ideals of india with my own additionally clinton howard the chairman of the world peace commission was invited to speak at the angelus temple in  she promoted disarmament if the nations of the world would stop building warships and equipping armies we would be all but overwhelmed with prosperity foursquare leaders alarmed at rapid changes of technology especially sea and air which challenged the united states isolation and security decided to officially draw up an amendment inclusive of varied opinions in regards to military service the idea that one could trust to bear arms in a righteous cause as well as believing the killing of others even in connection to military service would endanger their souls both views were acceptable reaction to waredit mcpherson kept a canny eye on the international events leading up to the second world war citing the probability of a much more terrible conflict than the one that passed  years earlier in a sermon she described a recently conquered country which had the cross and other religious symbols in their schools removed in their place was a portrait of a certain man instead of prayer their school day began with a distinctive salute to this person the destructive apocalypse of john the apostle with its expected high civilian casualties followed by the second coming of christ it seemed was at hand even if submarines were hiding in the depths of the sea they could not escape the terror that would befall them congregation at angelus temple during hour holy ghost service led by aimee semple mcpherson los angeles calif  allnight prayer meetings were held friday nights at the angelus temple starting in  the year when germany was overrunning belgium the netherlands and france she asked other foursquare churches around the country to follow suit she sent president franklin roosevelts secretary mr stephen early as well as some other leaders an outline of her plans prayer to her was even more powerful than the implements of war various officials expressed their appreciation including the governor of california early passed on a reply back from roosevelt a message of thanks for her work a month later roosevelt declared a national day of prayer to beseech the ruler of the universe to bless our republic foursquare leaders thought mcpherson may have inspired it and perhaps the president of the united states was looking to her for spiritual leadership of the nation at the outbreak of world war ii mcpherson rejected the christian pacifism of many in the pentecostal movement including those of her own church her mind was set on doing what ever it took to assist the united states in winning the war it is the bible against mein kampf it is the cross against the swastika it is god against the antichrist of japan this is no time for pacifism the angelus temple itself became a visible symbol of home front sacrifice for the war effort if necessary it was announced the building could be used for an air raid shelter the distinctive white dome was painted over with black paint and its beautiful stainedglass windows were covered up the temple like other buildings in the city had to have any opening or window that could emit visible light at night covered one evening in may  to advertise the need to conserve gasoline and rubber mcpherson herself drove a horse and buggy to the angelus temple rubber and other drives were organized and unlimited airtime on her radio station kfsg was given to the office of war information she asked parishioners and other listeners to donate two hours a day for such tasks as rolling bandages so that a soldiers bandage could be changed and let us give our blood to help every one money was raised to provide local military bases with comfortable furnishings and radios newsweek published an article about mcpherson the worlds greatest living minister on july   noting she had collected  pints of blood for the red cross servicemen in her audience are especially honored and the climax of her church services is when she reads the national anthem mcpherson gave visiting servicemen autographed bibles she observed they often had no religious affiliation and did not even own a bible she wrote what a privilege it was to invite the servicemen present in every sunday night meeting to come to the platform where i greeted them gave each one a new testament and knelt in prayer with them for their spiritual needs and god’s guidance and protection on their lives later when the altar call would be given many of these same servicemen would make another trip to the platform publicly to receive jesus christ as their personal savior she insulted adolf hitler and hideki tōjō and became involved in war bond rallies pershing squares victory house in los angeles never saw a bigger crowd mcpherson sold  worth of bonds in one hour on june   breaking all previous records then repeated the performance again on july   the us treasury awarded her a special citation the army made mcpherson an honorary colonel her wartime activities included sermons that linked the church and american patriotism mcpherson spoke to the men in uniform of her belief that military action against the axis powers was long overdue and more so than in almost any war previously she felt that if they did not prevail churches homes and everything precious and dear to the christian would absolutely be destroyed mcphersons embrace of the total war strategy of the united states left her open to some criticism the line between the church as an independent moral authority monitoring government became blurred perceived instead as complicit with that same governance wrongs being done to japanese americans through their internment in relocation camps were being overlooked for example and she refused to allow her denomination to support christians who remained committed pacifists even if conscientious objectors were willing to participate in noncombat roles more was needed church members and leaders had to be willing to take up arms and fight for the united states the pacifist clause which earlier existed was by her proposal voted upon and eliminated by foursquare gospel church leaders deathedit mcphersons grave on september   mcpherson went to oakland california for a series of revivals planning to preach her popular story of my life sermon when mcphersons son went to her hotel room at  the next morning he found her unconscious with pills and a halfempty bottle of capsules nearby she was dead by  it was later discovered she previously called her doctor that morning to complain about feeling ill from the medicine but he was in surgery and could not be disturbed she then phoned another doctor who referred her to yet another physician however mcpherson apparently lost consciousness before the third could be contacted the autopsy did not conclusively determine the cause of mcphersons death she had been taking sleeping pills following numerous health problems – including tropical fever among the pills found in the hotel room was the barbiturate seconal a strong sedative which had not been prescribed for her it was unknown how she obtained them the coroner said she most likely died of an accidental overdose compounded by kidney failure the cause of death is officially listed as unknown given the circumstances there was speculation about suicide but most sources generally agree the overdose was accidental as stated in the coroners report fortyfive thousand people waited in long lines some until  am to file past the evangelist where for three days her body lay in state at the angelus temple within a mileandahalf  m radius of the church police had to double park cars it later took  trucks to transport the  worth of flowers to the cemetery which itself received more telegrammed floral orders than at any time since will rogers death almost  years earlier a foursquare leader noted that to watch the long line pass reverently by her casket and see tears shed by all types of people regardless of class and color helped give understanding to the farreaching influence of her life and ministry an observer marcus bach who was on a spiritual odyssey of personal discovery wrote roberta who had married an orchestra director flew in from new york ma kennedy was at the grave rheba crawford splivalo had returned to say that there was never a greater worker for god than sister a thousand ministers of the foursquare gospel paid their tearful tribute the curious stood by impressed the poor who had always been fed at angelus were there the lost who had been spiritfilled the healed the faithful here they were eager to immortalize the ontario farm girl who loved the lord here they laid the body of sister aimee to rest in the marble sarcophagus guarded by two great angels on sunrise slope  millions of dollars passed through mcphersons hands however when her personal estate was calculated it amounted to  to her daughter roberta went  the remainder to her son rolf by contrast her mother mildred kennedy had a  severance settlement of as much as  in cash and property the foursquare church itself was worth  million mcpherson is buried in forest lawn memorial park cemetery in glendale california following her death the foursquare gospel church denomination was led for  years by her son rolf mcpherson the church claims a membership of over  million worldwide legacy and influenceedit ministryedit mcphersons ministry continued to flourish even in the face of scandal the newspapers which served to propel mcpherson to fame and advertise her message also were used to highlight her faults real and imagined some modern televangelists who transgressed and faded into obscurity because of highprofile news coverage also learned how quickly modern communication media could hurt as well as help them after her death the largely negative aspect of her media image persisted was cultivated and became the dominant factor in defining mcpherson for many in the public today reverend robert p shuler whose caustic view of mcpherson softened over the years wrote he could not figure out why god chose such a person the flaws he observed in mcpherson were by his opinion many yet she ultimately made a positive impact on christianity long lasting and enduring  he recognized her appeal was a combination of identifying with the average citizen as well as an ability to explain the gospel in simple easily understandable terms drawing them irresistibly to her services while great cathedral churches closed their doors on sunday night the crowds pushed through her portals in one everflowing stream he saw her legacy extend far beyond the glamor of hollywood exerting itself through the thousands of ministers she trained and churches planted throughout the world mcpherson together with the alliances she made worked to reshape the evangelical christian faith making it relevant to american culture and personally involving for those in the audience legacyedit uldine utley c  in fresno california  nineyearold uldine utley – became a fervent believer after hearing mcphersons dramatic retelling of the david and goliath story the young girl tearfully gave her life over to christ and dedicated herself to be a little david for the lord and fight goliath with her parents as managers she went on to preach to millions of people and converted many thousands the most notable of these was john sung who would become a major evangelical figure in china utley frequently used the same metaphors as mcpherson referring to christ as the rose of sharon and invoking bride of christ imagery during the great depression years as a child dr edwin louis coles mother attended life bible college and as he grew up cole participated in various angelus temple activities witnessing the miraculous cole went on to found the christian mens network and influenced many including bill mccartney founder of promise keepers pat robertson john maxwell president of injoy ministries kenneth copeland oliver north and chuck norris according biographer matthew avery sutton in the early s it was expected traditional protestantism would give way to rapidly developing new philosophical ideas and sciences that were being widely taught mcpherson contributed immensely to the forestalling of that predicted inevitability liberal christianity which enjoyed strong growth starting in the late th century regarded many of the miracles of jesus to be superstitious interpretations of what actually occurred or metaphors for his teachings mcphersons faithhealing demonstrations instead gave credence to onlookers her claim was true jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever this bible verse of hebrews  as biographer daniel mark epstein noted as per mcpherson meant jesus still had power and could heal as in ancient times and the verse become the motto of her foursquare gospel church sutton wrote conveying it was easy for many people to deny a god who did something  years ago but large crowds of people were now witness to the blind seeing the lame walking and the deaf hearing healings at her services according to epstein from period news sources were occurring faster than the journalists could write them down crowds clamored to reach her altar to experience a new testament conversion that transformed many of their lives even large portions of the secular public admired her the old time gospel message was being dramatically marketed by the most technologically advanced means possible reconstructing it into something far more interesting and desirable than it was previously mcphersons ecumenical approach assisted pentecostals in learning how better to explain their faith in the context of historic church doctrine mainline churches became exposed to the more unusual gifts of the holy spirit they also benefited by borrowing pentecostal revival techniques such as more emotive expression joyful praise worship and testimonials forerunning the charismatic movement mcpherson challenged what was expected from women females as preachers and her status as a divorcee with two failed marriages were of particular concern to many of the fundamentalist churches with which she wanted to work but her success could not be easily ignored meanwhile secular society broadly labeled women as either victorian ladies or whores and she bounced from one category to the other she had her extensive relief charities and along with it titillating scandals atheist charles lee smith remarked publicly of mcpherson just before a debate that she had an extraordinary mind particularly for a woman her continual work at church alliancebuilding finally bore fruit in an official way though she did not live to see it foursquare gospel church leaders were at last able to join the national association of evangelicals in  and from there helped organize the pentecostal world fellowship which exists to the present day pentecostalism which once advocated separatism and was on the fringes of protestantism became part of mainstream christianity works about mcphersonedit books

her mother mildred known as minnie who worked with the poor in salvation army soup kitchens as a child she would play salvation army with her classmates and at home she would gather a congregation with her dolls giving them a sermon as a teenager mcpherson strayed from her mothers teachings by reading novels and going to movies and dances activities which were strongly disapproved of by both the salvation army and the religion of her father james kennedy a methodist novels though made their way into the methodist church library and with guilty delight mcpherson would read them at the movies she recognized some of her fellow methodist church members she learned too at a local dance she attended that her dancing partner was a presbyterian minister in high school she was taught charles darwins theory of evolution she began to quiz visiting preachers and local pastors about faith and science but was unhappy with the answers she received she wrote to the canadian newspaper family herald and weekly star questioning why taxpayerfunded public schools had courses such as evolution which undermined christianity this was her first exposure to fame as people nationwide responded to her letter while still in high school after her pentecostal conversion mcpherson began a crusade against the concept of evolution beginning a lifelong passion conversionedit robert and aimee semple  while attending a revival meeting in december  aimee met robert james semple a pentecostal missionary from ireland there her faith crisis ended as she decided to dedicate her life to god and made the conversion to pentecostalism as she witnessed the holy spirit moving powerfully marriage and familyedit at that same revival meeting aimee became enraptured not only by the message that robert semple gave but also with robert himself she decided to dedicate her life to both god and robert and after a short courtship they were married on august   in a salvation army ceremony pledging never to allow their marriage to lessen their devotion to god affection for comrades or faithfulness in the army the pairs notion of army was very broad encompassing much more than just the salvation army robert supported them as a foundry worker and preached at the local pentecostal mission together they studied the bible aimee claiming robert taught her all she knew though other observers state she was far more knowledgeable than she let on after a few months they moved to chicago and became part of william durhams full gospel assembly durham earlier had visited the mission where the azusa street revival was taking place returned and applied its teachings under durhams tutelage aimee was discovered to have a unique ability in the interpretation of speaking in tongues translating with stylistic eloquence aimee semple and her second husband harold mcpherson for a time harold traveled with his wife aimee in the gospel caras an itinerant preacher himself helping her to set up tents for revival meetings after embarking on an evangelistic tour to china both contracted malaria robert also contracted dysentery of which he died in hong kong aimee recovered and gave birth to their daughter roberta star semple as a yearold widow on board a ship returning to the united states aimee semple started a sunday school class then held other services as well oftentimes mentioning her late husband in her sermons almost all passengers attended shortly after her recuperation in the united states semple joined her mother minnie working with the salvation army while in new york city she met harold stewart mcpherson an accountant they were married on may   moved to providence rhode island and had a son rolf potter kennedy mcpherson in march  during this time mcpherson felt as though she denied her calling to go preach after struggling with emotional distress and obsessive–compulsive disorder she would fall to weep and pray she felt the call to preach tug at her even more strongly after the birth of rolf then in  she fell seriously ill and mcpherson states she again heard the persistent voice asking her to go preach while in the holding room after a failed operation mcpherson accepted the voices challenge and she suddenly opened her eyes and was able to turn over in bed without pain one spring morning in  her husband returned home from the night shift to discover mcpherson had left him and taken the children a few weeks later a note was received inviting him to join her in evangelistic work aimee semple mcpherson and her third husband david l hutton enjoying their honeymoon breakfast to avoid news publicity they chartered a plane to yuma arizona and were married in a small ceremony hutton assisted in some of mcphersons charity work before their divorce in  her husband later followed mcpherson to take her back home when he saw her though preaching to a crowd he witnessed her transformation into a radiant lovely woman before long he became her fellow worker in christ their house in providence was sold and he joined her in setting up tents for revival meetings and even did some preaching himself throughout their journey food and accommodations were uncertain as they lived out of the gospel car her husband in spite of initial enthusiasm wanted a life that was more stable and predictable eventually he returned to rhode island and around  filed for separation he petitioned for divorce citing abandonment the divorce was granted in  she married again on september   to actor and musician david hutton followed by much drama after which she fainted and fractured her skull while mcpherson was away in europe to recover she was angered to learn hutton was billing himself as aimees man in his cabaret singing act and was frequently photographed with scantily clad women huttons muchpublicized personal scandals were damaging the foursquare gospel church and their leaders credibility with other churches mcpherson and hutton separated in  and divorced on march   mcpherson later publicly repented of the marriage as wrong from the beginning for both theological and personal reasons and therefore rejected nationally known gospel singer homer rodeheaver a more appropriate suitor when he eventually asked for her hand in  early careeredit while married to robert semple the two moved to chicago and became part of william durhams full gospel assembly there aimee was discovered to have a unique ability in the interpretation of speaking in tongues translating with stylistic eloquence the otherwise indecipherable utterances of glossolalia unable to find fulfillment as a housewife in  mcpherson began evangelizing and holding tent revivals across the sawdust trail in the united states and canada after her first successful visits she had little difficulty with acceptance or attendance eager converts filled the pews of local churches which turned many recalcitrant ministers into her enthusiastic supporters frequently she would start a revival meeting in a hall or church and then have to move to a larger building to accommodate the growing crowds when no buildings were suitable she set up a tent which was often filled past capacity she wanted to create the enthusiasm a pentecostal meeting could provide with its amen corner and halleluiah chorus but also to avoid its unbridled chaos as participants started shouting trembling on the floor and speaking in tongues all at once mcpherson organized her meetings with the general public in mind and yet did not wish to quench any who suddenly came into the spirit to this she set up a tarry tent or room away from the general area for any who suddenly started speaking in tongues or display any other holy ghost behavior by which the larger audience might be put off in  mcpherson embarked on a tour of the southern united states in her gospel car and again later in  with her mother mildred kennedy mildred was an important addition to mcphersons ministry and managed everything including the money which gave them an unprecedented degree of financial security their vehicle was a  packard touring car emblazoned with religious slogans standing on the back seat of the convertible mcpherson preached sermons over a megaphone on the road between sermons she would sit in the back seat typing sermons and other religious materials she first traveled up and down the eastern united states then went to other parts of the country by  she had started her own magazine the bridal call for which she wrote many articles about women’s roles in religion she portrayed the link between christians and jesus as a marriage bond along with taking seriously the religious role of women the magazine contributed to transforming pentecostalism from a movement into an ongoing american religious presence  while mcpherson was traveling for her evangelical work she arrived in baltimore where she was first discovered by the newspapers in  after a day of conducting evangelistic services at the lyric opera house baltimore became one of the pivotal points for her early career the crowds in their religious ecstasy were barely kept under control as they gave way to manifestations of the spirit moreover her alleged faith healings now became part of the public record and attendees began to focus on that part of her ministry over all else mcpherson also considered the baltimore revival an important turning point not only for her ministry but in the history of the outpouring of the pentecostal power  career in los angelesedit in late  mcpherson came to los angeles a move many at the time were making for better opportunities minnie kennedy her mother rented the largest hall they could find the seat philharmonic auditorium known then as temple auditorium people waited for hours to get in and mcpherson could hardly reach the pulpit without stepping on someone afterwards grateful attendees of her los angeles meetings built a home for her family and her which included everything from the cellar to a canary bird at this time los angeles had become a popular vacation spot rather than touring the united states to preach her sermons mcpherson stayed in los angeles drawing audiences from a population which had soared from  in  to  people in  and often included many visitors wearied by constant traveling and having nowhere to raise a family mcpherson had settled in los angeles where she maintained both a home and a church mcpherson believed that by creating a church in los angeles her audience would come to her from all over the country this she felt would allow her to plant seeds of the gospel and tourists would take it home to their communities still reaching the masses for several years she continued to travel and raise money for the construction of a large domed church building at  glendale blvd in the echo park area of los angeles the church would be named angelus temple reflecting the roman catholic tradition of the angelus bell calling the faithful to prayer as well its reference to the angels not wanting to take on debt mcpherson located a construction firm which would work with her as funds were raised by faith she started with  the firm indicated it would be enough to carve out a hole for the foundation mcpherson began a campaign in earnest and was able to mobilize diverse groups of people to help fund and build the new church various fundraising methods were used such as selling chairs for temple seating at us  apiece in exchange chairholders got a miniature chair and encouragement to pray daily for the person who would eventually sit in that chair her approach worked to generate enthusiastic giving and to create a sense of ownership and family among the contributors raising more money than she had hoped mcpherson altered the original plans and built a megachurch that would draw many followers throughout the years the endeavor cost contributors around  in actual money spent however this price was low for a structure of its size costs were kept down by donations of building materials and volunteer labor mcpherson sometimes quipped when she first got to california all she had was a car ten dollars and a tambourine enrollment grew exceeding  and was advertised to be the largest single christian congregation in the world according to church records angelus temple received  million visitors within the first seven years mcpherson intended the angelus temple as both a place of worship and an ecumenical center for persons of all christian faiths to meet and build alliances a wide range of clergy and laypeople consisted of methodists baptists the salvation army presbyterians episcopalians adventists quakers roman catholics mormons and even secular civic leaders who came to the angelus temple they were welcomed and many made their way to her podium as guest speakers eventually even rev robert p shuler a oncerobust mcpherson critic was featured as a guest preacher because pentecostalism was not popular in the united states during the s mcpherson avoided the label she practiced speakingintongues and faith healing within her services but kept the former to a minimum in sermons to appease mainstream audiences discarded medical fittings from persons faithhealed during her services which included crutches wheelchairs and other paraphernalia were gathered for display in a museum area as evidence of her early influence by the salvation army mcpherson adopted a theme of lighthouses for the satellite churches referring to the parent church as the salvation navy this was the beginning of mcpherson working to plant foursquare gospel churches around the country charitable workedit mcpherson left prepares christmas food baskets about  mcpherson strove to develop a church organization which could not only provide for the spiritual but also the physical needs of the distressed though she fervently believed and preached the imminent return of jesus christ she had no idea of how soon that second coming might be two thoughts pervaded the mind of most devout pentecostals of the time jesus is coming therefore how can i get ready and how can i help others to get ready for mcpherson part of the answer was to mobilize her temple congregation and everyone she could reach through radio telephone and word of mouth to get involved in substantial amounts of charity and social work true christianity is not only to be good but to do good she preached the charities and beneficiary department collected donations for all types of humanitarian relief to include a japanese disaster as well as a german relief fund men released from prison were found jobs by a brotherhood a sisterhood was created as well sewing baby clothing for impoverished mothers branch churches elsewhere in the country were likewise encouraged to follow the angelus temples example even people who considered mcphersons theology almost ridiculous helped out because they saw her church as the best way to assist their community in june  after confirming reports of an earthquake in santa barbara mcpherson immediately left the parsonage and interrupted a broadcast at a nearby radio station she took over the microphone from the startled singer and requested food blankets clothing or whatever listeners could give for emergency supplies to assist nearby santa barbara as the red cross met to discuss and organize aid mcphersons second convoy had already arrived at the troubled city in  after a dam failed and the ensuing flood left up to  dead in its wake mcphersons church led the relief effort later in  an earthquake struck and devastated long beach mcpherson quickly arranged for volunteers to be on the scene with blankets coffee and doughnuts men wait in line to enter aimee semple mcphersons angelus temple free dining hall  commissary located at  w temple street at the time she was married to david hutton and all branding reflected his last name drawing from her childhood experience with the salvation army in  mcpherson opened a commissary at angelus temple which was devised to assist the needy on a much larger formalized scale the commissary was virtually the only place in town a person could get food clothing and blankets with no questions asked it was open  hours a day seven days a week and became active in creating soup kitchens free clinics and other charitable activities as the great depression wore on she fed an estimated  million people when the government shut down the free schoollunch program mcpherson took it over her policy of giving first and investigating afterward allowed waste and a certain number of deadbeats to leech off the program but it alleviated suffering on an epic scale mcpherson got the fire and police departments to assist in distribution doctors physicians and dentists were persuaded to staff her free clinic that trained  nurses to help treat children and the elderly she encouraged individuals and companies of all types to donate supplies food cash or labor to prevent the power from being turned off to homes of overdue accounts during the winter a  cash reserve was set up with the utility company many people who otherwise would have nothing to do with the angelus temple would receive a call from mcpherson and then loot their mansion closets or company stores for something to give the yellow cab company donated a large building and in the first month  people received meals there laboring under a sign everybody and anybody is somebody to jesus volunteer workers filled commissary baskets with an assortment of food and other items as well as foursquare gospel literature and handed them out even a complete kit designed to care for newborn babies was available a reporter wrote he had always thought the breadline was a drab colorless scar on our civilization but of the angelus temple commissary he observed was the warm garment of sympathy and christian succor a note which reflects the sentiment of many of those who received assistance was left in june  at mcphersons virtual gravesite my grandpa always talked about when he was a kid he and his family moved to california from missouri during the depression and his family was starving and they met you and you gave them a bag of vegetables and some money he never forgot it anonymous establishing an employment bureau as well mcpherson desired to help the discouraged husband the despondent widow or the little mother who wants extra work to bear the burden of a sick husband she expected everyone in her temple to be involved let us ever strive to lighten our brothers load and dry the tears of a sister race creed or status make no difference we are all one in the eyes of the lord she encouraged members to think of the commissary as widening the spirituality of the whole church line of unemployed men getting meals at dining hall run by aimee semple mcpherson  in  the commissary was raided by police to allegedly locate a still used to make brandy out of donated apricots some sauerkraut and salad oil were purportedly observed leaking from their respective storage areas as a consequence the commissary was briefly shut down the press got involved and the public demanded an investigation since no one really wanted to stall the temples charity efforts the acceptable solution was to replace the immediate management the staff was let go and students from her foursquare gospel churchs life bible college filled in the newspaper media generally cynical of the temple and in particular of mcpherson recognized the excellent features of that organizations efforts and the faults of the angelus temple are outweighed by its virtues mcpherson issued a statement declaring they have clashed loud their cymbals and blown their trumpets about a still and some sauerkraut our work is still before us ifanybody abused his trust it must not happen again as mcpherson tried to avoid administrative delays in categorizing the deserving from the undeserving her temple commissary became known as one of the regions most effective and inclusive aid institutions few soup kitchens lasted more than several months but mcphersons remained open even as she transformed herself into a fashionable blonde hollywood socialite mcphersons vigor and practicality for social activism did not change she loved organizing big projects a  survey indicated the angelus temple assisted more family units than any other public or private institution in the city because her programs aided nonresidents as well such as migrants from other states and mexico she ran afoul of california state regulations though temple guidelines were later officially adjusted to accommodate those policies helping families in need was a priority regardless of their place of residence actor anthony quinn recalls this was all during the height of the depression when hunger and poverty permeated america many mexicans were terrified of appealing for county help because most of them were in the country illegally when in distress they were comforted by the fact that they could call one of aimees branches at any time of the night there they would never be asked any of the embarrassing questions posed by the authorities the fact that they were hungry or in need of warm clothing was enough no one even asked if they belonged to aimees church or not ministryedit style of ministryedit in august  and away from los angeles mcpherson decided to charter a plane so she would not miss giving her sunday sermon aware of the opportunity for publicity she arranged for at least  followers and members of the press to be present at the airport the plane failed after takeoff and the landing gear collapsed sending the nose of the plane into the ground mcpherson boarded another plane and used the experience as the narrative of an illustrated sunday sermon called the heavenly airplane the stage in angelus temple was set up with two miniature planes and a skyline that looked like los angeles in this sermon mcpherson described how the first plane had the devil for the pilot sin for the engine and temptation as the propeller the other plane however was piloted by jesus and would lead one to the holy city the skyline shown on stage the temple was filled beyond capacity angelus temple completed in  is the center of the international church of the foursquare gospel founded by mcpherson in  angelus temple was designated a national historic landmark it is still in active use on another occasion she described being pulled over by a police officer calling the sermon arrested for speeding dressed in a traffic cops uniform she sat in the saddle of a police motorcycle earlier placed on the stage and revved the siren one author in attendance insisted she actually drove the motorcycle with its deafening roar across the access ramp to the pulpit slammed on the brakes then raised a whitegloved hand to shout stop youre speeding to hell since mcpherson gave some of her sermons more than once and with variations the possibility existed both versions might be true mcpherson employed a small group of artists electricians decorators and carpenters who built the sets for each sundays service religious music was played by an orchestra mcpherson also worked on elaborate sacred operas one production the iron furnace based on the book of exodus told of god’s deliverance as the israelites fled slavery in egypt some hollywood movie stars even assisted with obtaining costumes from local studios the cast was large perhaps as many as  people but so elaborate and expensive it was presented only one time rehearsals for the various productions were timeconsuming and mcpherson did not tolerate any nonsense though described as always kind and loving mcpherson demanded respect regarding the divine message the sacred operas and her other works were designed to convey aimee semple mcpherson surrounded by massed choirs at angelus temple for a musical requiem in  even though mcpherson condemned theater and film as the devils workshop its secrets and effects were coopted she became the first woman evangelist to adopt the whole technique of the moving picture star mcpherson desired to avoid the dreary church service where by obligation parishioners would go to fulfill some duty by being present in the pew she wanted a sacred drama that would compete with the excitement of vaudeville and the movies the message was serious but the tone more along the lines of a humorous musical comedy animals were frequently incorporated and mcpherson the once farm girl knew how to handle them mcpherson gave up to  sermons a week and the lavish sunday night service attracted the largest crowds extra trolleys and police were needed to help route the traffic through echo park to and from angelus temple to finance the angelus temple and its projects collections were taken at every meeting often with the admonishment no coins please mcpherson preached a conservative gospel but used progressive methods taking advantage of radio movies and stage acts advocacy for womens rights was on the rise including womens suffrage through the th amendment she attracted some women associated with modernism but others were put off by the contrast between her different theories by accepting and using such new media outlets mcpherson helped integrate them into people’s daily lives sister mcpherson used the media to her advantage as she became the first modern celebrity preacher minister aimee semple mcpherson and a group of tambourine players leading a service at angelus temple she was very innovative in producing weekly dramas illustrating religious themes the battle between fundamentalists and modernists escalated after world war i with many modernists seeking less conservative religious faiths fundamentalists generally believed their religious faith should influence every aspect of their lives mcpherson sought to eradicate modernism and secularism in homes churches schools and communities she developed a strong following in what mcpherson termed the foursquare gospel by blending contemporary culture with religious teachings mcpherson was entirely capable of sustaining a protracted intellectual discourse as her bible students and debate opponents will attest but she believed in preaching the gospel with simplicity and power so as to not confuse the message her distinct voice and visual descriptions created a crowd excitement bordering on hysteria the appeal of mcphersons  or so revival events from  to  surpassed any touring event of theater or politics ever presented in american history neither houdini nor teddy roosevelt had such an audience nor pt barnum her one to fourweek meetings typically overflowed any building she could find to hold them she broke attendance records recently set by billy sunday and frequently used his temporary tabernacle structures in which to hold some of her meetings her revivals were often standingroom only one such revival was held in a boxing ring with the meeting before and after the match throughout the boxing event she walked about with a sign reading knock out the devil in san diego california the city called in the national guard and other branches of the armed forces to control a revival crowd over  people she became one of the most photographed persons of her time she enjoyed the publicity and quotes on almost every subject were sought from her by journalists faith healing ministryedit main article faith healing ministry of aimee semple mcpherson mcphersons ability to draw crowds was also greatly assisted by her apparently successful faith healing presentations almost by accident she discovered when she laid hands on sick or injured persons they got well one early mcpherson biographer nancy barr mavity described the healing power beyond her conscience sic control and profoundly troubling however a phenomenon familiar to the psychiatrist although none the less sic mysterious  during a  revival meeting in corona long island new york a young woman in the advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis was brought to the altar by friends mcpherson would have preferred to pray with her privately however the woman insisted upon immediate prayer mcpherson laid hands on her and prayed before the gathered parishioners the woman walked out of the church without crutches mcphersons reputation as a faith healer rapidly became known and the sick and injured people came to her by the tens of thousands the faith healing ministry of aimee semple mcpherson was extensively written about in the news media and was a large part of her early career legacy no one has ever been credited by secular witnesses with anywhere near the numbers of faith healings attributed to mcpherson especially during the years  to  over time though she almost withdrew from the faithhealing aspect of her services since it was overwhelming other areas of her ministry scheduled weekly and monthly healing sessions nevertheless remained highly popular with the public until her death in  the foursquare churchedit foursquare church logo eventually mcphersons church evolved into its own denomination and became known as the international church of the foursquare gospel usually referenced as the foursquare church foursquare is an alternative word for full gospel a term used by pentecostals referencing the nature of christs character that he was savior baptizer with the holy spirit healer and sooncoming king the four main beliefs were the first being christs ability to transform individuals lives through the act of salvation the second focused on a holy baptism which includes receiving power to glorify and exalt christ in a practical way the third was divine healing newness of life for both body and spirit and the fourth was gospeloriented heed to the premillennial return of jesus christ mcpherson published the weekly foursquare crusader along with her monthly magazine bridal call she began broadcasting on radio in the early s on a sunday morning in april  the rockridge radio station in oakland ca offered her some radio time and she became the first woman to preach a sermon over the wireless telephone with the opening of foursquare gospelowned kfsg on february   she became the second woman granted a broadcast license by the department of commerce the federal agency that supervised broadcasting in the early s mcpherson racially integrated her tent meetings and church services on one occasion as a response to mcphersons ministry and angelus temple being integrated ku klux klan members were in attendance but after the service hoods and robes were found on the ground in nearby echo park she is also credited with helping many hispanic ministries in los angeles mcpherson traveling about the country holding widely popular revival meetings and filling local churches with converts was one thing settling permanently into their city caused concern among some local los angeles churches though she shared many of their fundamentalist beliefs such as divine inspiration of the bible the classical trinity virgin birth of jesus historical reality of christs miracles bodily resurrection of christ and the atoning purpose of his crucifixion the presentation of lavish sermons and an effective faithhealing ministry presented by a female divorcee whom thousands adored and about whom newspapers continuously wrote was unexpected moreover the temple especially the women had a look and style uniquely theirs they would emulate mcphersons style and dress and a distinct angelus temple uniform came into existence a white dress with a navy blue cape thrown over it men were more discreet wearing suits her voice projected over the powerful stateoftheart kfsg radio station and heard by hundreds of thousands became the most recognized in the western united states mcpherson preaching at the newly built angelus temple in  her messages showcased the love of god redemption and the joys of service and heaven contrasting sharply with the fireandbrimstone style of sermon delivery popular with many of her peers her illustrated sermons attracted criticism from some clergy members because they thought it turned the gospel message into mundane theater and entertainment divine healing as mcpherson called it was claimed by many pastors to be a unique dispensation granted only for apostolic times rival radio evangelist reverend robert p shuler published a pamphlet entitled mcphersonism which purported that her most spectacular and advertised program was out of harmony with gods word debates such as the bogardmcpherson debate in  drew further attention to the controversy but none could really argue effectively against mcphersons results the new developing assemblies of god denomination pentecostal as mcpherson was for a time worked with her but they encouraged separation from established protestant faiths mcpherson resisted trends to isolate as a denomination and continued her task of coalitionbuilding among evangelicals mcpherson worked hard to attain ecumenical vision of the faith and while she participated in debates avoided pitched rhetorical battles that divided so many in christianity she wanted to work with existing churches on projects and to share with them her visions and beliefs assisting in her passion was the speedy establishment of life bible college adjacent to the angeles temple ministers trained there were originally intended to go nationally and worldwide to all denominations and share her newly defined foursquare gospel a wellknown methodist minister frank thompson who never had the pentecostal experience was persuaded to run the college and he taught the students the doctrine of john wesley mcpherson and others meanwhile infused them with pentecostal ideals for about a year antonia frederick futterer suggested by los angeles times as the inspiration for steven spielbergs film character indiana jones was also a facility member mcphersons efforts eventually led pentecostals which were previously unconventional and on the periphery of christianity into the mainstream of american evangelicalism life in the media spotlightedit media relationsedit by early  mcpherson had become one of the most charismatic and influential women and ministers of her time her fame equaled to name a few charles lindbergh johnny weissmuller jack dempsey babe ruth ty cobb knute rockne bobby jones louise brooks and rudolph valentino she was a major american phenomenon who along with some other highprofile preachers of the time unlike hollywood celebrities could be admired by their adoring public without apparently compromising their souls

service clubs an official spokesman for the community on problems grave and frivolous she was influential in many social educational and political areas mcpherson made personal crusades against anything that she felt threatened her christian ideals including the drinking of alcohol and teaching evolution in schools mcpherson became a strong supporter of william jennings bryan during the  scopes trial in which john scopes was tried for illegally teaching evolution at a dayton tennessee school bryan and mcpherson had worked together in the angelus temple and they believed darwinism had undermined students morality according to the new yorker mcpherson said evolution is the greatest triumph of satanic intelligence in  years of devilish warfare against the hosts of heaven it is poisoning the minds of the children of the nation she sent bryan a telegram saying ten thousand members of angelus temple with her millions of radio church membership send grateful appreciation of your lionhearted championship of the bible against evolution and throw our hats in the ring with you she organized an allnight prayer service a massive church meeting preceded by a bible parade through los angeles politicsedit while her mother mildred kennedy was a registered democrat no one was certain of mcphersons registration she endorsed herbert hoover over franklin d roosevelt but enthusiastically threw her support behind the latter and his social programs when he was elected into office she was a patron of organized labor preaching a gangsters money was no more unclean than the dollars of the man who amasses his millions from underpaid factory workers she was more cautious though when labor strikes resulted in violent uprisings she saw in them the possible activities of communism which sought to infiltrate labor unions and other organizations mcpherson intensely disliked communism and its derivatives as they sought to rule without god their ultimate goal she believed was to remove christianity from the earth mcphersons opinion of fascism fared no better its totalitarian rule was wrongly justified by claiming to represent the power of god mcpherson did not align herself consistently with any broad conservative or liberal political agenda instead she explained if christianity occupied a central place in national life and if the components of god home school and government were kept together everything else would fall into place remove any of these she warned and civilization topples crumbles current foursquare gospel church leaders qualify the evangelists views mcpherson’s passion to see america sustained in spiritual health which compelled her quest to see the church influence government must be interpreted in light of the political and religious climate of the s s and s it is not accurate to draw a parallel between today’s extreme fundamentalist rightwing christianity and the style or focus of sister mcpherson she was also among the first prominent christian ministers to defend the establishment of a jewish homeland in palestine she related that when christ returns the jews would receive him their suffering will end and they will

received letters and calls claiming knowledge of mcpherson including demands for ransom mcpherson sightings occurred around the country often in widely divergent locations many miles apart on the same day as a precaution the ransom notes were sent to the police who investigated at least one of them mildred kennedy though regarded the messages as hoaxes believing her daughter dead as the angelus temple prepared for a memorial service commemorating mcphersons death kennedy received a phone call from douglas arizona her daughter was alive the distraught mcpherson was resting in a douglas

occasionally visiting when at last all her captors were away on errands she escaped out a window using a mountain as a landmark she traveled through the desert for around – hours across an estimated distance of  miles  km around  am she reached agua prieta sonora a mexican border town and collapsed near a house there she was assisted by the residents and finally taken to adjacent douglas return to los angelesedit after leaving douglas mcpherson was greeted at the los angeles train station by – people more than for almost any other personage the parade back to the temple even elicited a greater turnout than president woodrow wilsons visit to los angeles in  attesting to her popularity and the growing influence of mass media entertainment already incensed over mcphersons influential public stance on evolution and the bible most of the chamber of commerce and some other civic leaders saw the event as gaudy display nationally embarrassing to the city many los angeles area churches were also annoyed the story received nationwide coverage then speculations together with alleged witnesses began to emerge that her disappearance might have been caused by other than the kidnapping event mcpherson described against the wishes of her mother who thought the press would continue to unfavorably exploit the story mcpherson decided for vindication and presented her complaint in court a grand jury inquiry convened to determine if enough evidence could be found to indict any kidnappers however pressured by various influential community groups the court instead intensely investigated mcpherson her family and acquaintances to determine if the kidnapping was fabricated district attorney asa keyes led the prosecution against her he was known for winning convictions but six persons he sent to prison were found to be innocent and pardoned by the state governor grand jury inquiryedit the grand jury inquiries were first convened on july   adjourned and reconvened holding sessions through the summer of  accompanied by intense media interest the proceedings were supposed to be secret as per california law though the los angeles court spoke about it to the newspapers issues of trial by media and court of public opinion were apparent as much of the proclaimed evidence against mcpherson came from reporters who featured it in their news articles and passed it on to the police mcpherson also eschewed secrecy and freely used her radio station to broadcast her side of the story evidence and testimonies were hotly debated by an evenly divided public on november  the case was determined to be moved to jury trial set for midjanuary  along with mcpherson and her mother several other defendants were charged in the inquiry if convicted the counts added up to maximum prison time of  years various speculations were proffered by the news media and prosecution as to the reason for mcphersons disappearance the one they settled on most strongly was she ran off with an exemployee kenneth ormiston she was accused of staying with him in a california resort town cottage until may  the time frame of ormistons seaside cottage rental coincided with the first  days of her disappearance however a missing threeweek period afterwards was not accounted for with any evidence in court by the prosecution in response the evangelist maintained all along without changing anything in her story that she was taken held captive by the kidnappers and escaped as she originally described as the prosecution tried to break down her story defense witnesses corroborated her assertions  or mcpherson herself demonstrated how the disputed parts were plausible in contrast the prosecutions case developed serious credibility issues witnesses changed their testimonies and evidence often had suspicious origins or was mishandled while in custody finally on january   ormiston identified elizabeth tovey a nurse from seattle washington as his female companion and the woman who stayed with him at the seaside cottage all charges against mcpherson and associated parties were dropped by the court for the lack of evidence on january   after the case dismissaledit regardless of the courts decision months of unfavorable press reports fixed in much of the publics mind a certainty of mcphersons wrongdoing the newspapers had a vested interest in keeping the controversy going since it generated huge sales the bulk of the investigation against mcpherson was funded by los angelesarea newspapers at an estimated amount of  some supporters thought mcpherson should have insisted on the jury trial and clear her name the grand jury inquiry concluded while enough evidence did not exist to try her it did not indicate her story was true with its implication of kidnappers still at large court costs to mcpherson were estimated to be as high as  a jury trial could take months mcpherson moved on to other projects in  she published a book about her version of the kidnapping in the service of the king the story of my life various influential individuals offered their opinions on the inquiry in a letter to the los angeles times a few months after the case was dropped the reverend robert p shuler stated perhaps the most serious thing about this whole situation is the seeming loyalty of thousands to this leader in the face of her evident and positively proven guilt hl mencken noted journalist satirist cultural critic and scholar and an ideological opponent of mcpherson opposite each other in the  scopes monkey trial also commented he wrote that since many of that towns residents acquired their ideas of the true the good and the beautiful from the movies and newspapers los angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her claims of extramarital affairsedit during her lifetimeedit numerous allegations of illicit love affairs were often directed against mcpherson suspected lovers generally denied involvement for example kenneth ormiston a married man with a small son could have profited immensely from an exposé about himself and mcpherson whether the two had a good working relationship and were friendly with each other was not disputed during the  kidnapping grand jury trial reporters and investigators tried to link him amorously to mcpherson ormiston told newspapers his name connected in such a way to the evangelist was a gross insult to a noble and sincere woman mcpherson was often the target of numerous unsubstantiated sexually related allegations as reported by the los angeles times june   this photograph depicts the evangelist reading a note demanding  else nude motion pictures of her and a friend would be publicly released when inquired about it in an unrelated interview later that year she tersely stated nude pictures of her did not exist because none were ever taken alarmed by her rapidly changing style of dress and involvement with hollywood and its worldly lifestyle in  an angelus temple official hired detectives to shadow mcpherson through her windows the detectives frequently saw mcpherson staying up until the early morning hours composing songs drafting sacred operas and scribbling diagrams of her illustrated sermons they were looking for evidence of her indiscretions but found nothing no confirmation of adulterous misconduct with perhaps exception of her third marriage as a violation of church tenets was ever presented mcpherson herself aware of numerous accusations leveled at her throughout her career responded only to a small fraction of them conveying the only thing she had time for was preaching jesus posthumouslyedit posthumously unsubstantiated allegations of extramarital affairs continued to emerge this time by those who stated to have been her partner claims not mentioned by them or others while she was still alive canadian journalist gordon sinclair implied such a claim in his  autobiography will the real gordon sinclair please stand up sinclair stated he worked on a story with mcpherson and during one of those times in  the incident purportedly occurred sinclair alluded to a sexual dalliance with mcpherson one afternoon along with some gin and ginger thirty years after her death another claim by comedian milton berle in a  autobiography alleges a brief affair with the evangelist in his book titled milton berle an autobiography berle asserts he met mcpherson at the shrine auditorium in los angeles where both were doing a charity show biographer matthew avery sutton commented berle a notorious womanizer whose many tales of scandalous affairs were not always true claimed to have had sex with mcpherson on this and one other occasion both during a year when mcpherson was often ill and bedridden sutton noted that berles story of a crucifix in mcphersons bedroom was not consistent with the coolness of pentecostalcatholic relations during that era another book by milton berle laughingly yours which had autobiographical content that was published in  while mcpherson was still alive did not have this claim author raymond l cox states mrs mcphersons daughter roberta salter of new york told me mother never had an apartment in her life by  she kept herself securely chaperoned to guard against such allegations during  the evangelists appearances and whereabouts can be traced almost every day she was incapacitated with illness a full five months of that year and there is no place on her schedule as reported in her publications and church and travel records for the benefit berle alleged besides roberta also told cox mother never did a benefit in her life she had her own charities later life and careeredit mcpherson surrounded by flowers cutting into angelus temple cake  not one for settling into a predictable routine she used her birthday national holidays and other events as themes for church services and gala festivities after fallout with pressedit following her heyday in the s mcpherson carried on with her ministry but fell out of favor with the press they once dubbed her the miracle worker or miracle woman reporting extensively on her faithhealing demonstrations but now were anxious to relay every disturbance in her household to the headlines her developing difficulties with her mother mildred kennedy were starting to take the front page yet mcpherson emerged from the kidnapping nationally famous as much as  of the population in los angeles held membership in her temple for a time movie studios competed with each other offering mcpherson longterm contracts believing that talking pictures had the potential to transform christianity mcpherson explored hollywood culture and appeared in newsreels alongside other famous individuals such as mary pickford frances perkins and franklin d roosevelt she lost weight cut and dyed her hair began to wear makeup and jewelry and became stylish and wellattired a critic wrote mcpherson can outdress the hollywood stars the solicitation of fame justified to draw audiences to her and hence to christ was more than some in her church organization could accept they yearned for sister aimee in the old time dress referring to her previous trademarked uniform of a navy cape over a white servants dress both purchased inexpensively in bargain basements other members though loved it and her angelus temple services were as popular as ever and remained so throughout her life unless parishioners arrived to a service early frequently they could not get in all seats were taken now that she could afford it mcpherson thought as well she wanted her apparel and display to be the best she could present to jesus in early  mcpherson immediately set out on a vindication tour visiting various cities and taking advantage of the publicity her kidnapping story created to preach the gospel her visit to new york in foxfurs and a finely trimmed yellow suit was noted in the society pages she visited even nightclubs to include a famous speakeasy in new york texas guinan’s three hundred club on th street while mcpherson sipped water at her table guinan asked if she would speak a few words to the patrons delighted mcpherson stood and addressed the jazzed and boozy crowd behind all these beautiful clothes behind these good times in the midst of your lovely buildings and shops and pleasures there is another life there is something on the other side “what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul” with all your getting and playing and good times do not forget you have a lord take him into your hearts the unexpected speech that did not judge and had a conciliatory tone between them and the divine earned a thoughtful moment of silence from the crowd then an applause that went on for much longer than the speech took the revelers were invited to hear her preach at the glad tidings tabernacle on rd street the visits to speakeasies and nightclubs added to mcphersons notoriety newspapers reported heavily on them rumors erroneously conveyed she was drinking smoking and dancing and her mother along with some other church members did not understand mcphersons strategy of tearing down barriers between the secular and religious world between the sinner and the saved problems with mildred kennedyedit without mildred kennedys conservative financial management replacement administrators embarked on a spread of ambitious projects that often failed an example of this was lake tahoe lot deals of which the cover of an alleged prospectus describes not enough parcels of land were purchased and the subsequent lawsuit brought by investors drew unfavorable publicity and the attention of the district attorneys office in the summer of  mildred kennedy mcphersons mother left the angelus temple in an attempt to curtail her daughters influence and officially transfer more power to herself kennedy initiated a staffmember vote of confidence against mcpherson but lost the two had heatedly argued over management polices and mcphersons changing personal dress and appearance for similar reasons  members of the choir left as well the choir could be replaced however kennedys financial and administrative skills had been of crucial importance in growing mcphersons ministry from tent revivals to satellite churches and maintaining its current activities in the temple a series of less able management staff replaced kennedy and the temple became involved in various questionable projects such as hotel building cemetery plots and land sales accordingly the angelus temple plummeted deep into debt in response to the difficulties kennedy came back in late  but because of continued serious disagreements with mcpherson tendered her resignation on july   the following month mcpherson suffered a physical and nervous breakdown for  months she was absent from the pulpit diagnosed in part with acute acidosis resurrecting her careeredit when she gained strength and returned she introduced with renewed vigor her moving attar of roses sermon based on the song of solomon with its rose of sharon as the mystical body of christ while journalists attending her sunday illustrated sermons assumed her language was fit only for slapstick or sentimental entertainment scholars who have studied her work for bible students and small prayer groups found instead the complex discourse of neoplatonic interpretation the old testament book the song of solomon for example she had hundreds of pages written about it each different from one another as snowflakes the october –  revival in boston started out sluggishly and many predicted its failure a los angeles newspaper ran headlines of the flop and expected more of the same in the days to come on opening night mcpherson spoke to fewer than  persons in the seat sports arena and safety pins and rubber bands abundantly cluttered the collection baskets the city had large populations of unitarians episcopalians and catholics venerable denominations traditionally hostile to a pentecostal or fundamentalist message afterwards from her hotel room mcpherson known to be a sports fan asked for the afternoons world series scores and a boston herald reporter sent her a copy of the sunday edition the next day the bring back the bible to boston campaigns tone shifted as mcpherson took greater control and attendance climbed sharply a reporter took note of mcphersons stage presence different from any other evangelist who spoke there gesturing with her white bible for effect as well as preaching answering him as to why she presented a dramatic sermon she stated our god is a dramatic god rolling back the red sea elijah on the mountaintop the crucifixion the resurrection his ascension tongues of fire on the day of pentecost the final day of afternoon and evening services had  persons attending the stadium was full and more than  had to be turned away a total of  people attended the meetings breaking historic attendance records of any nine days of revival services in boston her revival in new york city was not very fruitful as her sensationalistic reputation preceded her the third marriage to david hutton rumored romances and her kidnapping was what its press and citizens wanted to hear about therefore after a brief pause in new york and washington dc she went on philadelphia and other cities traveling to  of them in  states speaking to as much as  of the entire population of the united states a full crew of musicians scene designers and costumers accompanied mcpherson in this her last national revival tour between september  and december   two million persons heard  sermons many more were reached by  radio stations the boston evening traveler newspaper reported aimees religion is a religion of joy there is happiness in it her voice is easy to listen to she does not appeal to the brain and try to hammer religion into the heads of her audience rather she appeals to the hearts of her hearers she radiates friendliness she creates an atmosphere that is warming she is persuasive rather than forceful gracious and kindly rather than compelling fundamentally she takes the whole bible literally from cover to cover nevertheless she was not a radical literalist in an informal meeting with some harvard students mcpherson told them that genesis allowed great latitude of interpretation and that neither she nor the bible insisted the world was created only  years ago in another meeting with students she heard their assertion the teachings of christ have outlived their usefulness education science and cold reasoning were the new saviors of the world thus compelled mcpherson decided to travel and look at the world with new eyes in  mcpherson embarked on a worldwide sixmonth discovery tour to examine the social religious and economic climates of many countries at one point it was earlier reported she wanted to study the womens movement in connection with the campaign for the independence of india and was anxious to have a chat with mahatma gandhi she received an invitation from him and he gave her a sari made from threads woven from his simple spinning wheel impressed with gandhi and his ideas mcpherson thought he might secretly lean towards christianity his dedication possibly coming from catching a glimpse of the cleansing lifting strengthening power of the nazarene other highlights included traversing barefoot in myanmar the lengthy stone path to the great pagoda a goldcovered ft tiered tower enshrining relics of four buddhas which caught and reflected the rays of the sun a vision of breathtaking glory she heard benito mussolini speak in italy and fretted war would again ensue in the rain at verdun france she sat on a wrecked military vehicle in mournful contemplation of the hundreds of thousands who died on the stilluncleared battlefield white bleached bones of the fallen poked out of the earth and nearby laborers toiled carefully at their dangerous iron harvest collecting old munitions for disposal in mid a delegation who had been involved with the  azusa street mission revivals including emma cotton asked if they could use the angelus temple for their th anniversary celebration the original mission building was demolished and its land unavailable african american evangelist emma cotton and mcpherson therefore organized a series of meetings which also marked her enthusiastic reidentification with the pentecostal movement mcphersons experiments of hollywood celebrity ambitions coexisting with her ministry were not as successful as she hoped alliances with other church groups were failing or no longer in effect and she searched for ways to start again therefore she looked to her spiritual origins and allowed for the possibility of reintroducing even the more alarming aspects of the pentecostal experience into her public meetings temple officials were concerned the azusa people might bring in some wildfire and holy rollerism mcpherson indicated she would turn hand springs with them as needed to see the power of god manifest the azusa street revival commemoration events brought numbers of black leaders to her pulpit the original attendees of the azusa revivals filled the angelus temple along with every ethnic minority the saints who were once smelted together with the fires of pentecost were being reunited rewelded and rejuvenated mcpherson recommitted herself to the dissemination of classic pentecostalism and her concern now was that foursquaredom was in the danger of becoming too churchy for the first time since the temple opened mcpherson began to publicly deliver some of her messages in tongues mcpherson traversed the line between cold formality and wildfire and now decided it was easier to cool down a hot fanatic than to resuscitate a corpse future meetings to celebrate the azusa street revivals included guest charles h mason a founder of the churches of god in christ mason an azusa leader was also one of the most significant african american religious figures in united states history and was frequently hosted at the angelus temple roberta star semple left mcphersons daughter aimee semplemcpherson middle and rheba crawford splivalo assistant pastorright at a parade in  problems with the templeedit also in  mcpherson reassigned staff responsibilities in an effort to address the temples financial difficulties this together with other unresolved issues accelerated simmering tensions among various staff members rumors circulated that angel of broadway charismatic evangelist rheba crawford splivalo who had been working extensively with mcpherson for several years planned to take the angelus temple from her mcpherson asked splivalo to leave town in the course of the staff controversy mcphersons lawyer issued a strongly worded press release that upset roberta star semple mcphersons daughter and led her to initiate a  lawsuit against him for slander splivalo also sued mcpherson for  because of alleged statements calling her a ‘jezebel and a judas’ and unfit to stand in the angelus temple pulpit the two lawsuits filed by semple and splivalo were not related but mcpherson did not see it that way she saw both as part of the temple takeover plot mcphersons mother was also involved and sided with semple her granddaughter making unflattering statements about mcpherson to the press in these charged circumstances mcphersons defense of herself and her lawyer in a public trial was dramatic and theatrical she testified tearfully with swoons and faints about how her daughter conspired with others against her her daughters lawyer meanwhile mocked mcpherson by imitating her mannerisms and making faces at her the trial did much to estrange mcpherson from her daughter the judge ruled for semple giving a  judgment in her favor semple then moved to new york splivalo and the temple settled their suit out of court for the cause of religion and the good of the community with kennedy semple and splivalo gone the temple lost much of its talented leadership however mcpherson found a competent and firm administrator in giles knight who was able to bring the temple out of debt dispose of the  or so lawsuits and eliminate the more spurious projects he sequestered mcpherson allowed her to receive only a few personal visitors and carefully regulated her activities outside the temple this period was one of unprecedented creativity for mcpherson no longer distracted by waves of reporters reams of lawsuits and innumerable individuals demanding her attention she became very accomplished in her illustrative sermon style of gospel preaching the irreligious charlie chaplin would secretly attend her services enjoying her sermons she later met and consulted with chaplin on ways to improve her presentations mcpherson who earlier blared across newspaper headlines as many as three times a week in one alleged scandal or another had her public image much improved her adversary reverend robert p shuler who previously attacked her by radio magazine pulpit and pamphlet proclaimed aimees missionary work was the envy of methodists he also expressed his support of her foursquare church application admittance into national association of evangelicals for united action in  her efforts at making interracial revival a reality at angelus temple continued she welcomed blacks into the congregation and pulpit while race riots burned detroit in  mcpherson publicly converted the notorious black former heavyweight champion jack johnson on the temple stage and embraced him “as he raised his hand in worship” war yearsedit views on waredit pacifism which was a component of pentecostalism was evaluated by the foursquare gospel church in the s with official statements and documents which were further revised by mcpherson a press quote attributed to mcpherson in reference to mahatma gandhi appears to explore the concept i want to incorporate the ideals of india with my own additionally clinton howard the chairman of the world peace commission was invited to speak at the angelus temple in  she promoted disarmament if the nations of the world would stop building warships and equipping armies we would be all but overwhelmed with prosperity foursquare leaders alarmed at rapid changes of technology especially sea and air which challenged the united states isolation and security decided to officially draw up an amendment inclusive of varied opinions in regards to military service the idea that one could trust to bear arms in a righteous cause as well as believing the killing of others even in connection to military service would endanger their souls both views were acceptable reaction to waredit mcpherson kept a canny eye on the international events leading up to the second world war citing the probability of a much more terrible conflict than the one that passed  years earlier in a sermon she described a recently conquered country which had the cross and other religious symbols in their schools removed in their place was a portrait of a certain man instead of prayer their school day began with a distinctive salute to this person the destructive apocalypse of john the apostle with its expected high civilian casualties followed by the second coming of christ it seemed was at hand even if submarines were hiding in the depths of the sea they could not escape the terror that would befall them congregation at angelus temple during hour holy ghost service led by aimee semple mcpherson los angeles calif  allnight prayer meetings were held friday nights at the angelus temple starting in  the year when germany was overrunning belgium the netherlands and france she asked other foursquare churches around the country to follow suit she sent president franklin roosevelts secretary mr stephen early as well as some other leaders an outline of her plans prayer to her was even more powerful than the implements of war various officials expressed their appreciation including the governor of california early passed on a reply back from roosevelt a message of thanks for her work a month later roosevelt declared a national day of prayer to beseech the ruler of the universe to bless our republic foursquare leaders thought mcpherson may have inspired it and perhaps the president of the united states was looking to her for spiritual leadership of the nation at the outbreak of world war ii mcpherson rejected the christian pacifism of many in the pentecostal movement including those of her own church her mind was set on doing what ever it took to assist the united states in winning the war it is the bible against mein kampf it is the cross against the swastika it is god against the antichrist of japan this is no time for pacifism the angelus temple itself became a visible symbol of home front sacrifice for the war effort if necessary it was announced the building could be used for an air raid shelter the distinctive white dome was painted over with black paint and its beautiful stainedglass windows were covered up the temple like other buildings in the city had to have any opening or window that could emit visible light at night covered one evening in may  to advertise the need to conserve gasoline and rubber mcpherson herself drove a horse and buggy to the angelus temple rubber and other drives were organized and unlimited airtime on her radio station kfsg was given to the office of war information she asked parishioners and other listeners to donate two hours a day for such tasks as rolling bandages so that a soldiers bandage could be changed and let us give our blood to help every one money was raised to provide local military bases with comfortable furnishings and radios newsweek published an article about mcpherson the worlds greatest living minister on july   noting she had collected  pints of blood for the red cross servicemen in her audience are especially honored and the climax of her church services is when she reads the national anthem mcpherson gave visiting servicemen autographed bibles she observed they often had no religious affiliation and did not even own a bible she wrote what a privilege it was to invite the servicemen present in every sunday night meeting to come to the platform where i greeted them gave each one a new testament and knelt in prayer with them for their spiritual needs and god’s guidance and protection on their lives later when the altar call would be given many of these same servicemen would make another trip to the platform publicly to receive jesus christ as their personal savior she insulted adolf hitler and hideki tōjō and became involved in war bond rallies pershing squares victory house in los angeles never saw a bigger crowd mcpherson sold  worth of bonds in one hour on june   breaking all previous records then repeated the performance again on july   the us treasury awarded her a special citation the army made mcpherson an honorary colonel her wartime activities included sermons that linked the church and american patriotism mcpherson spoke to the men in uniform of her belief that military action against the axis powers was long overdue and more so than in almost any war previously she felt that if they did not prevail churches homes and everything precious and dear to the christian would absolutely be destroyed mcphersons embrace of the total war strategy of the united states left her open to some criticism the line between the church as an independent moral authority monitoring government became blurred perceived instead as complicit with that same governance wrongs being done to japanese americans through their internment in relocation camps were being overlooked for example and she refused to allow her denomination to support christians who remained committed pacifists even if conscientious objectors were willing to participate in noncombat roles more was needed church members and leaders had to be willing to take up arms and fight for the united states the pacifist clause which earlier existed was by her proposal voted upon and eliminated by foursquare gospel church leaders deathedit mcphersons grave on september   mcpherson went to oakland california for a series of revivals planning to preach her popular story of my life sermon when mcphersons son went to her hotel room at  the next morning he found her unconscious with pills and a halfempty bottle of capsules nearby she was dead by  it was later discovered she previously called her doctor that morning to complain about feeling ill from the medicine but he was in surgery and could not be disturbed she then phoned another doctor who referred her to yet another physician however mcpherson apparently lost consciousness before the third could be contacted the autopsy did not conclusively determine the cause of mcphersons death she had been taking sleeping pills following numerous health problems – including tropical fever among the pills found in the hotel room was the barbiturate seconal a strong sedative which had not been prescribed for her it was unknown how she obtained them the coroner said she most likely died of an accidental overdose compounded by kidney failure the cause of death is officially listed as unknown given the circumstances there was speculation about suicide but most sources generally agree the overdose was accidental as stated in the coroners report fortyfive thousand people waited in long lines some until  am to file past the evangelist where for three days her body lay in state at the angelus temple within a mileandahalf  m radius of the church police had to double park cars it later took  trucks to transport the  worth of flowers to the cemetery which itself received more telegrammed floral orders than at any time since will rogers death almost  years earlier a foursquare leader noted that to watch the long line pass reverently by her casket and see tears shed by all types of people regardless of class and color helped give understanding to the farreaching influence of her life and ministry an observer marcus bach who was on a spiritual odyssey of personal discovery wrote roberta who had married an orchestra director flew in from new york ma kennedy was at the grave rheba crawford splivalo had returned to say that there was never a greater worker for god than sister a thousand ministers of the foursquare gospel paid their tearful tribute the curious stood by impressed the poor who had always been fed at angelus were there the lost who had been spiritfilled the healed the faithful here they were eager to immortalize the ontario farm girl who loved the lord here they laid the body of sister aimee to rest in the marble sarcophagus guarded by two great angels on sunrise slope  millions of dollars passed through mcphersons hands however when her personal estate was calculated it amounted to  to her daughter roberta went  the remainder to her son rolf by contrast her mother mildred kennedy had a  severance settlement of as much as  in cash and property the foursquare church itself was worth  million mcpherson is buried in forest lawn memorial park cemetery in glendale california following her death the foursquare gospel church denomination was led for  years by her son rolf mcpherson the church claims a membership of over  million worldwide legacy and influenceedit ministryedit mcphersons ministry continued to flourish even in the face of scandal the newspapers which served to propel mcpherson to fame and advertise her message also were used to highlight her faults real and imagined some modern televangelists who transgressed and faded into obscurity because of highprofile news coverage also learned how quickly modern communication media could hurt as well as help them after her death the largely negative aspect of her media image persisted was cultivated and became the dominant factor in defining mcpherson for many in the public today reverend robert p shuler whose caustic view of mcpherson softened over the years wrote he could not figure out why god chose such a person the flaws he observed in mcpherson were by his opinion many yet she ultimately made a positive impact on christianity long lasting and enduring  he recognized her appeal was a combination of identifying with the average citizen as well as an ability to explain the gospel in simple easily understandable terms drawing them irresistibly to her services while great cathedral churches closed

promise keepers pat robertson john maxwell president of injoy ministries kenneth copeland oliver north and chuck norris according biographer matthew avery sutton in the early s it was expected traditional protestantism would give way to rapidly developing new philosophical ideas and sciences that were being widely taught mcpherson contributed immensely to the forestalling of that predicted inevitability liberal christianity which enjoyed strong growth starting in the late th century regarded many of the miracles of jesus to be superstitious interpretations of what actually occurred or metaphors for his teachings mcphersons faithhealing demonstrations instead gave credence to onlookers her claim was true jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever this bible verse of

in the context of historic church doctrine mainline churches became exposed to the more unusual gifts of the holy spirit they also benefited by borrowing pentecostal revival techniques such as more emotive expression joyful praise worship and testimonials forerunning the charismatic movement mcpherson challenged what was expected from women females as preachers and her status as a divorcee with two failed marriages were of particular concern to many of the fundamentalist churches with which she wanted to work but her success could not be easily ignored meanwhile secular society broadly labeled women as either victorian ladies or whores and she bounced from one category to the other she had her extensive relief charities and along with it titillating scandals atheist charles lee smith remarked publicly of mcpherson just before a debate that she had an extraordinary mind particularly for a woman her continual work at church alliancebuilding finally bore fruit in an official way though she did not live to see it foursquare gospel church leaders were at last able to join the national association of evangelicals in  and from there helped organize the pentecostal world

also known as the foursquare church which continues to spread the foursquare gospel throughout the world to this day the beginning aimee semple mcpherson was born aimee elizabeth kennedy on october   near ingersoll ontario canada and was the only child of james and minnie kennedy although she was reared in a christian home she began to question the bible during her teen years when she was  years old and still in high school she attended a revival service conducted by pentecostal evangelist robert semple where she heard the message of repentance and a bornagain experience she resisted the message at first but the holy spirit continued to speak to her heart convicting her of the sin in her life and of her need for a savior after a threeday struggle with doubt and uncertainty she prayed and asked the lord to save her as soon as she did so the weight of sin was gone and she was filled with amazing joy when aimee heard the evangelist speak also of the baptism with the holy spirit she became consumed with the desire to experience that pentecostal baptism after a time of prayer and seeking the lord she was filled with the holy spirit and began speaking in tongues from that time forward she had a love and compassion for souls and a longing to serve the lord that remained with her throughout her lifetime setting sail the revival meeting that changed her life spiritually also changed her life romantically before long the handsome robert semple had won aimee’s heart and the two were married in august  just shy of aimee’s th birthday their individual desires to serve the lord seemed to fit together perfectly after ministering in chicago and the ingersoll area the semples began preparations to go as missionaries to china in  shortly before aimee turned  she and her husband of less than two years set sail for china it seemed to the young couple that they would have a lifetime together preaching the word of god and ministering to those for whom the lord had so burdened their hearts but that was not to be robert and aimee both contracted malaria within months of arriving in hong kong and robert died only three months after their arrival leaving aimee as a nineteen year old penniless widow awaiting the imminent birth of her first child when her daughter roberta star semple was a month old aimee returned to the united states to face life as a single
