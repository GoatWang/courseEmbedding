medical isotope corporation ami   is a late stage development company engaged primarily in the development of brachytherapy devices and medical isotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic applications  amis focus is on transitioning to full operations upon receipt of fda clearance for its patented y brachytherapy product radiogel™   what is brachytherapy brachytherapy is the use of radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radiation source inside or next to the treatment area  according to global industry analysts by  the us brachytherapy market will reach  billion  it is estimated that the us market represents approximately half of the global market  ami believes there are significant opportunities in prostate breast liver pancreatic head and neck cancers  the  us estimated new cases according to the american cancer society are  prostate cancer  breast cancer and  liver cancer what is radiogel™ the y radiogel™ device is a brachytherapy device comprising highly insoluble y particles delivered by needle injection using a waterpolymer composite for highdose treatment of nonresectable solid tumors that cannot be treated effectively by any other means it is designed for maximum safety to deliver a high purebeta radiation dose to target tumor tissue with comparatively smalltonegligible radiation doses to adjacent normal tissues and with negligible radiation dose to any major organ or tissue in the body two key design characteristics of the y radiogel™ device that influence safety and efficacy are  the ability to place y particles directly into tumor tissue via injection and  yttrium containment within the tumor after injection advanced medical isotope corporation has obtained an exclusive license to eight  patents related to the y radiogel™ device technology for use in highdose radiation therapy the license was granted by battelle pursuant to an option between battelle and ami announced in february  the agreement grants ami an exclusive license to make have made use and sell the y radiogel™ device yttrium is a wellestablished medical isotope with many applications in cancer treatment the combination of insoluble yttrium particles and the polymer gel carrier offers physicians an opportunity to deliver a safe effective treatment option at a low cost what are the advantages of radiogel™ based upon its studies and analyses or general application of experience with current brachytherapy devices and yttrium ami believes that its brachytherapy products are likely to offer the following benefits among others for patients and medical professionals •maximizing therapeutic index the shortrange beta particles emitted by y deliver radiation energy within a tight range this enables radiation to be selectively delivered to target tissues while minimizing radiation dose to nearby normal tissues high therapeutic indices imply that more radiation energy may be imparted to target tissues with less radiation reaching adjacent normal tissues •half life y has a halflife of just  days many traditional brachytherapy products use isotopes with longer halflives such as  days for cesium and sixty days for iodine •optimized delivery method current brachytherapy devices place permanent metal seeds in the prostate by using up to  large needles by contrast ami’s y radiogel™ device is designed to be administered in a minimally invasive procedure with smallgauge needles •no permanent seeds remaining current brachytherapy devices place permanent metal seeds in the tumor ami’s y radiogel™ device utilizes a biodegradable nontoxic polymer that is ultimately absorbed by the body this eliminates the possibility of a longterm seed migration or other problems that may sometimes arise when seeds remain in the body •good safety profile many traditional brachytherapy devices utilize isotopes that emit xrays akin to gamma radiation xrays or gamma radiation travels within and outside of the body and have long halflives ami’s brachytherapy products use the yttrium isotope which is a betaemitter the yttrium betaemissions travel only a short distance and has a short half life of  days •potential lower cost yttrium supplies are readily accessible and are relatively inexpensive the elimination of the metal or glass enclosures used in traditional brachytherapy seeds greatly reduces manufacturing costs what is the market for radiogel™ reliable sources estimate that annual sales of brachytherapy products exceed  billion about half of which are in the united states the size of the us brachytherapy market for prostate cancer brachytherapy is somewhere between  million and  million per year the market for liver and breast cancer combined is comparable what are the steps for fda clearance ami met at the fda offices to discuss next steps expectations and required testing to progress towards obtaining marketing clearance for the y radiogel™ device the fda and ami team are working closely in order to obtain all appropriate data and benchmarks the fda requires in order to proceed with providing final clearance for marketing the device in the united states in august ami announced a partnership with isotherapeutics group a thirdparty radiopharmaceutical rd company to provide commercialization support and conduct additional studies as requested by the fda for the y radiogel™ device isotherapeutics has completed the first stage of the project comprised of tech transfer manufacturing and in vitro testing the next stage comprised of additional in vitro and in vivo testing upon completion of these studies ami anticiptes submittal direct de novo for fda clearance for full commercialization in the us are there other markets for radiogel™  on march th  ami announced the formation of a new whollyowned subsidiary isopet solutions corporation to focus on the vibrant and expanding veterinary oncology market the isopet solutions division will focus on bringing ami’s yttrium brachytherapy products to veterinary oncologists to treat dogs and cats suffering from tumor cancers there are over  million pet dogs and cats with over  of the households in the us owning at least one dog and just under  owning at least one cat  isopet solutions is establishing the infrastructure necessary to provide product to veterinary clinics including regulatory clearances and compliance the division will also provide product awareness and education to veterinary oncologists ami expects the initial treatments to be coordinated through the chair of the company’s veterinary medicine advisory board dr

on our veterinarian market activities isopet i have been asked about the status of our first cat that was injected in november at washington state university to treat feline sarcoma that cat is alive and well after an objective response without any negative side effects this first treatment at a relatively low dose tested our procedures and provided valuable clinical experience on may  we treated a second cat at washington state university with a large sarcoma escalating the therapy dose by about  percent the cat has been returned to her owner and we will monitor the progress on response to therapy over the next several weeks results of these early clinical studies will help us to respond to questions posed by the fda on therapeutic efficacy and safety the detailed procedures that we are refining with these cat therapies are the same that we will be using to treat human skin cancer both are tumors at the surface of the skin we will initiate preclinical tests in surrogate tumor tissue at colorado state university this month to complete their safety review and evaluation requirements for first clinical therapeutic use anticipated in june likewise the independent safety review at university of missouri will be completed in a month with first therapy to follow in june we will next assess the university of california at davis which has the reputation of being a premier veterinary teaching center in the united states on the financial side as discussed in our q we successfully raised additional interim capital to retire some maturing debt and exchanged the remaining maturing debt that was outstanding for debentures that mature in may of  this removes the near term uncertainty and now allows ami to fully focus on execution of our plan for an uplisting later in the

today announced that a new proprietary process has been developed that significantly improves originally licensed technology on the companys y radiogel device after five months of effort the ami team have finalized an improved manufacturing process for our yttrium phosphate particles we conducted more than thirty process development runs to achieve the most costeffective process to reproducibly give us the small particles that we desire small particles perfuse further into the tumor and reduce the number of injections required for dose coverage in large tumors in parallel we concentrated on reducing the time and cost required for manufacturing and increasing the batch yield as an example one production step was reduced from  hours to just an hour product yield increased from  to  the process is elegantly simple but based on fundamental understanding of the underlying chemistry involved isotherapeutics a key manufacturing and testing contractor did a very professional job working with our team to explore all of the key manufacturing variables ami interim ceo and president dr mike korenko stated this is a significant improvement over the technology that was originally licensed to ami from the pacific northwest national laboratory this new proprietary process is an important part of our intellectual property and will reduce our manufacturing costs to position ami to make a profit on future sales the manufacturing process has now been institutionalized in a formal standard operating procedure which is needed to ensure a safe reproducible product for animal and human therapy and it is the protocol required by the food and drug administration dr korenko added this accomplishment required a great deal of effort and is a major step in executing our business plan which i outlined in my first letter to shareholders january  ami previously created the standard operating procedures for the hydrogel radiogel we are now working on the quality assurance and quality control plans and to convert all process activities to gmp good manufacturing processes which is a fda requirement this will complete the entire disciplined manufacturing process requirements about advanced medical isotope corporation the strategic market sector of advanced medical isotope corporation admd is isotope applications currently the company is engaged in the development of radiogeltm an yttrium based brachytherapy device for the treatment of tumors brachytherapy uses radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radioactive isotope inside the treatment area the company is engaging the fda for permission to use radiogel for the treatment of advanced basal and squamous skin cancers the isopet solutions division is focused on demonstrating the safety and therapeutic effectiveness for different animal cancers in four different university veterinary hospitals after this demonstration phase the plan is to sell radiogeltm to the private animal clinics the company currently is outsourcing material aspects of manufacturing of its product in the united states and intends to enter into licensing arrangements outside of the united states for the manufacturing and distribution of radiogeltm in other countries for more information please visit our websites wwwisotopeworldcom and wwwisopetsolutionscom about radiogel ami is developing a brachytherapy and topical cancer treatment product called radiogel radiogel is a hydrogel liquid containing tiny yttrium phosphate particles which may be injected into a tumor this hydrogel liquid is maintained at a temperature below body temperature but begins to gel harden once it is injected into the body and as the temperature increases up to body temperature thereby locking the particles in place the particles emit a very high concentrated and contained beta irradiation to kill the tumor the beta radiation has a short penetration distance so there is minimal collateral damage outside of the injected area radiogel also has a short halflife  after  days only about  of the radiation remains as opposed to other available options that would  after  days this is an outpatient treatment much safer to the personnel treating the patient than competing brands and the patient can go home immediately after with no risk to any family members safe harbor statement this release contains
