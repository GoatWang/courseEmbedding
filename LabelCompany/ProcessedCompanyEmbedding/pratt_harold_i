elemenatary science program in grades  was to be adopted by all schools in the district the district worked to implement the program in  elementary schools and a subset of  schools in which the researchers systematically studied the process during the first  years the study focused on teachers as beginning innovation users and during the next  years it focused on the role of principals as change facilitators the findings indicate staff development and implementation support should begin with more emphasis on the how to do its and delay concentrated presentations of theory for more experienced users in addition the utility of the two concepts for planning and facilitating implementation were demonstrated mlf documenting program adaptation in a districtwide implementation effort

report the first stage in the evolution consisted of the collection of data concerning the degree of implementation of identified components of the new program in several randomly selected schools in the second stage the program developers involved the building principals in the sampled schools in the implementation process obtaining dramatic increases in implementation levels the final stage consisted of refining the processes developed in the first two stages to accommodate the needs and concerns expressed by principals teachers and administrators this report concludes with a discussion
