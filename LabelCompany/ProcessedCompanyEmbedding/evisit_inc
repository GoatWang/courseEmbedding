reviews  recently reviewed simpleincredibly user friendly mar   david feist pac center for dermatology  plastic surgery  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money comments evisit customer service and it support are great i appreciate how responsive and quick they are at answering my questions and ensuring our success with their platform integration with my practices emr was seamless which was one of our big concerns very easy for the patient to see availability and to schedule an appointment my patients feedback has been very positive as well even patients who are far from tech savvy have told me they were able to have someone from evisit support guide them thru the setup process only occasional hiccups have been on the patients end ie not having internet connection or camera etc i have not encountered any problems with sending prescriptions or tailoring my calendaravailability i was once apprehensive and even a little skeptical when i was asked to research telemedicine options by my employers for a large dermatology practice but evisit has made the integration simple evisit has it dialed in nov   paul flatley emergency medicine physician directmd hospital  health care  employees used the software for  years  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros evisit has great customer support for both me as a provider and for my patients the interface is user friendly and intuitive they are constantly updating their product and adding new features cons not much to dislike here as with any it platform like this i just want it to work perfectly every time overall i started a telemedicinevirtual urgent care company last year and literally spoke with and demod at least  different companies before deciding to work with evisit i continue to be very happy with my decision while most of these competing companies offer the essentials like hipaa compliance encrypted video and eprescribe i have found the biggest difference with evisit on the back end lets face it its still new technology and there are going to be it problems some patients and even some providers are going to run into conflicts now and then i certainly have the difference with evisit is when i do have an issue and call for support a human answers the phone not only that its a knowledgeable person that has been able to solve the problem real time and on the rare occasion that they couldnt they put a ticket in that was vigorously addressed the very next day my patients have had the same experience when they have had the need to call and have been personally walked thru the enrollmentset up process this has been a huge difference maker in my practice and definitely where you get great value for your money recommendations to other buyers i think evisit is worth a very serious look while their product is great its the people behind it that make the difference you can talk with them troubleshoot and make suggestions that are actively responded to evisit for telemedicine nov   richard oyler md physician compass urgent care medical practice  employees used the software for less than  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros great functionality patients love it cons some of the more rural areas have to catch up to the fast paced technology overall great customer service and growing with our company as we provide care in a new platform this is an exciting time for medicine and treating patients in a new way we are happy to have evisit as our team member failed on multiple levels nov   lynn murphy physician lynn murphy md medical practice selfemployed used the software for less than  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money pros nothing  the website before purchase seems to have good information about telemedicine so i expected it to be a much more high quality software cons poor function  poor connectivity  missing minor features  silly errors like patients given the wrong date and time for appointment reminders  cannot access prior prescriptions  cannot access patient info from my phone terrible all around overall i have been trying for months to get this system to work but have continual problems with basic features it is not intuitive requires involvement with support to make any changes they make stupid errors like giving out my personal phone number to patients connectivity is always a problem and it misses primary needs like being able to find a patient phone number from the app ridiculous i would not choose evisitcom for your telemedicine platform recommendations to other buyers dont sign up with evisitcom until they get their act together vendor response by evisit on november   dr murphy as a company we welcome all feedback and see it as a gift thank you for taking the time to reach out to us we are taking your feedback to heart and it has been shared with all of our department leaders while your experience with our product is unfortunate it does not represent the experience reported to us by other physicians and practices i understand that you have been working with our customer success team on some of these challenges they will continue to help resolve these issues to your satisfaction in addition i have also left you a voicemail and would love to speak with you personally about your concerns please call me at your convenience as a company we are committed to simplifying healthcare it is disappointing that this has not been your experience to date we will continue to be committed

allows healthcare professionals to deliver health services education or training and health information remotely using telecommunications technology unlike telemedicine solutions which focus more specifically on clinical services telehealth solutions cover a broader range health services health professionals might use a telehealth solution to train healthcare staff engage and educate patients about a preventative health topic online or remotely monitor a patient’s recovery after hospital discharge the key focus of many of these telehealth software solutions leveraging telecommunications technologies to make health and information services more convenient and efficient and of course increasing the quality of patient care and raising patient engagement telehealth tools can be an incredibly powerful way of making widespread healthcare and health education more accessible – especially to remote parts of the us and the world since telehealth can mean so many different things there’s an incredible range of telehealth solutions available to physicians and other healthcare providers in recent years many healthcare specialties have started applying telecommunications technologies to their preventative patient education treatment and patient monitoring services here are some of the most popular telehealth solutions specialties teleradiology telepsychiatry teledermatology telenephrology teleobstetrics teleoncology teleopthamology telepathology telerehabilitation   what are the different types of telehealth solutions some telehealth providers offer software and other tools across many different specialties but many focus on a niche specialty or certain mode of telehealth what do we mean by mode of telehealth well consider how many different ways there are to share health information and engage with patients physicians and other healthcare staff here are just a few of the most common types of telehealth solutions store and forward telehealth solutions store and forward telehealth technology sometimes also called “asynchronous telehealth” allows healthcare professionals to share a patient’s medical images videos or health information with a physician at a different location this allows a medical professional to review a medical case without requiring the patient to be present it’s also a very commonly used telehealth solution in remote areas or places with limited specialists available a secure messaging system is a type of storeandforward telehealth software while storeandforward telehealth solution are popular with almost all medical specialties they’re especially common in radiology dermatology and ophthalmology for example doctors based in small remote hospitals may send xrays to radiologists at other locations it’s also relatively easy for a primary care provider to take a photo of a patient’s skin condition or eyes and forward to a dermatologist or ophthalmologist for quick screenings or further consultation store and forward telehealth is an effective way to boost healthcare efficiency since a physician patient and specialist don’t need to be in the same place at the same time that means lower patient wait times easy access to specialists even in places with shortages of providers and an optimized schedule for the physician who can review the case when they have time remote patient monitoring remote patient monitoring telehealth solutions sometimes also called “home telehealth” or “telemonitoring” allow physicians to track a patient’s health from afar a patient with diabetes for example can use a glucose tracker at home to measure levels of glucose and transmit them to their physician remote monitoring makes it easy for patients and doctors to stay in constant communication with very little effort or coordination many remote monitoring telehealth solutions automate the patient’s data transmission process and either send the doctor a regular report or allow them to “checkin” on the patient on their schedule some rpm telehealth software also lets physicians consult with patients remotely via live video  this means better treatment adherence less appointments less emergency visits because of unforeseen problems and overall better patient outcomes many physicians use remote patient monitoring to followup with patients after discharge from a hospital or other care facility  but rpm telehealth solutions are also becoming an increasingly popular way to monitor highrisk patients and catch problems before patients land in the hospital — especially for those with chronic conditions and patients who have trouble getting to a doctor’s office with the rise of wearable technology and mobile medical devices telehealth providers are starting to offer software and tools that not only connect the patient and physician but actually capture patients’ medical data more mobile medical devices come out every day that monitor vital signs check for ear infections incorporate ecg sensors etc fitness trackers also get patients engaged in their preventative health and keep physicians updated on things like weight loss exercise and general health mobile health solutions mobile health refers to healthcare patient engagement patient education and public health programs offered via mobile devices like cell phones laptops and tablets mhealth makes up a huge part of telehealth software solutions especially since a majority of people now own a smartphone mhealth solutions usually take the form of mobile apps they can be as simple as an app that texts patients reminders to take their medications to a more complex app that connects patients to physicians via live way video like the evisit mobile app some mhealth software focuses on educating users about health issues or better engaging them in their care as far as telehealth solutions go mhealth is one of the fast growing and most varied modes of telehealth realtime telehealth realtime telehealth sometimes called “synchronous telehealth” involves way live communication between a physician and patient usually via video this type is probably what you envision when you hear “telehealth”  realtime telehealth solutions are meant to substitute for an inperson doctorpatient visit whenever possible for example if a patient suspects she has an infection and needs to get quick treatment but cannot get in to see the doctor she could use a realtime telehealth solution to consult hisher doctor remotely and get a necessary prescription synchronous telehealth software can also be used for preventative services or for quick followups after operation or discharge to answer patient questions realtime telehealth providers offer a range of solutions and technology some offer entire telehealth “stations” that need to be installed at both the doctor’s office and in the patient’s home or facility often used in longterm care facilities others let patients logon to a secure website from their homes and see a physician contracted by the telehealth company to provide care the evisit app on the other hand is a realtime telehealth app that connects physicians with their existing patients for preventative care urgent care patient education followup checks and disease management  realtime telehealth software like the evisit app combines the best offerings of telehealth solutions out there – lowcost welldesigned minimal setup and easytouse technology that allows for convenient accessible remote healthcare distance medical consultation and education for providers telehealth software isn’t always made for patients healthcare providers are increasingly using telehealth solutions for remote consultation and medical education a top medical specialist based in california could review a patient case with medical students or a team of providers in florida to share their expertise a primary care provider could consult a specialist at another location about a tough patient case through live video a healthcare provider in the us could share a new medical technique or provide training on a public health issue to a team of doctors in a remote thirdworld country via phone or an online conference the possibilities and telehealth solutions in this case are endless about evisit the evisit app is a realtime telehealth solution that allows healthcare to connect with their existing patients via secure highresolution way video unlike other telehealth providers the evisit app is a physicianfirst tool built for physicians by physicians and was designed to facilitate reimbursement

telehealth you know that it involves using telecommunications technology for a range of health services at a distance but if you’re a healthcare provider or other health professional who wants to start a telehealth program you might not know where to start what kinds of telehealth systems and equipment are required most healthcare professionals and patients already have access to standard telecommunications technology such as an internet connection a personal computer or a telephone but many telehealth systems available require more than that some telehealth providers for example require purchase of telemedicine carts data storage mobile medical devices kits and comprehensive training and support packages the best telehealth systems are as intuitive and simple as possible here’s an overview of some of the basic elements of many telehealth systems telehealth kiosks telehealth systems used by retail clinics and employers sometimes require installation of a telehealth kiosk a telehealth kiosk is a small physical booth think photobooth usually with a curtain or door for privacy each kiosk usually holds a computer a monitor a webcam a microphone and a variety of mobile medical devices for capturing basic medical data like blood pressure or heart rate the idea behind this telehealth system is that patients can go to a convenient location either at their local drugstore or an onsite at work and get access to a range of medical specialists this eliminates the need for patients to purchase or setup any telemedicine equipment themselves webcams and digital cameras telehealth used to be practiced via telephone without any visual medical data now with the accessibility of the internet and highquality cameras telehealth systems rely heavily on remotely sharing medical images realtime telehealth systems for instance require a webcam to connect patients and providers or providers with a referring specialist through way video some systems might incorporate a simple digital camera that allows patients to take a photo of a rash and infection or a skin abnormality and share it securely with their doctor other telehealth systems especially storeandforward solutions depend on hightech cameras embedded into medical scopes to capture and share highresolution patient photos thriveleads id’′ telehealth stations and carts telehealth systems used by larger health systems often require a cart or mobile telehealth station the mobile carts are often stocked with everything physicians need to videoconference a consulting specialist capture and share patient medical data or checkin on a patient at home or in another facility in realtime healthcare providers might bring these carts into a patient’s hospital room to connect with another physician during the patient’s exam in some cases a patient recovering from hospitalization or suffering a chronic illness at home might have a telehealth cart setup so that they have all the equipment they need to connect with their physician remotely telehealth platforms telehealth systems always include a digital platform to access store share and secure patient medical data some telehealth platforms are software that needs to be installed on a practice or health system’s local server and can only be accessed on that network cloudbased telehealth platforms on the other hand live online and can be accessed from any computer or compatible mobile device with the right login information many telehealth platforms also now include a mobile app version that lets users logon via their smartphones while on the go you should always consider what features and functions are included in a telemedicine platform depending on the telehealth system you might need to purchase several different software packages for instance some systems have completely different platforms for realtime telehealth vs storeandforward solutions mobile medical devices mobile medical devices are an important part of many telehealth systems a physician visiting a patient’s home or working in a very remote area may rely on mobile medical devices to capture record and share important patient health information patients that are being remotely monitored usually use some type of mobile medical device in the home whether it’s a glucose tracker home blood press sure monitor or portable ecg monitor some telehealth systems might connect with a handheld console that asks patients questions like “how are you feeling today” and then transmits the patients’ answers to the provider over an internet connection not all telehealth systems require or integrate with mobile medical devices they’re most important for remote patient monitoring systems where patient health information needs to be captured outside a standard medical facility thriveleads id’′ selecting the right telehealth system for you the right telehealth system for you depends on many factors what type of telehealth solution
