vincent mancini in the godfather part iii  personal quotes  what he thinks the best age is im enjoying  old enough to know better young enough not to care my best evenings are at home with my lady i paint abstract expressions with me its always about first impressions i trust my instincts i love to prepare if its something that requires training but i dont like to prepare the psychology too much every day is a surprise there are confirmations of an interconnectivity and synchronicity which inspire titillate and confirm the inherent comedy of the universe on james cameron i had not met jim before auditioning for titanic  and i found him thoroughly charming and a genuine wit my impression of him revolves around his sense of humor which he never gets any credit for i dont think you take on incredible risks without a great sense of humor and titanic was the biggest film that anyone had ever worked on on back to the future  that was my first gig i had the rare and beautiful pleasure of being in town only two weeks before landing that film which set the tone for at least the first half of my career laughs i had auditioned for biff and everyone they liked as a runnerup became his goon squad on dead calm  being his breakout role absolutely i had everything to prove and nothing to lose its a dangerous combination for a yearold actor i remember once the film was in the can thinking if this plane from australia goes down ill at least have that performance i was satisfied and able to demonstrate my abilities as an actor you know after working with those guys i had made a mark and i was content with that honestly on what caused his career to decline one word alimony i was married at  for eight years with no children to a lovely girl lisa collins and were still friends but la law had gouged my assets and required exorbitant ransom for the better part of five years and i chose ultimate freedom and was happy to do anything to pay off a ridiculous monthly alimony dude it was heinous for a young man and this was happening right in the middle of titanic from that point on if you see a nose dip i was basically doing anything that paid to pay that off so it didnt get extended because then theres a penalty on twin peaks  twin peaks was awesome it was an incredible gift playing that role and supposedly getting to deflower audrey horne played by sherilyn fenn on your private jet while saving an endangered species i was like did i win the lottery on zoolander  i swear i get more love for five minutes of playing myself in that than  years of character work laughs i was living in new york at the time and id see ben out and about quite a bit and he called and asked if id do a cameo when i was there it suddenly evolved and all that came out of improv i love that i was the only one in dereks corner but we did so many different versions of that scene stuff it zane put a cork in it zane save it zane the fact that he kept saying my name billy zanes a cool dude he just kept hitting it and i was very embarrassed on the day but have come to be so grateful because im constantly met with strangers who claim billy zane is a cool dude i just hope to live up to it or i hear save it zane its certainly better than youre the asshole from titanic im like come on i wasnt the iceberg i didnt kill  people on the phantom  that film was ahead of its time in a weird way if it came out any later in the glut of superherodom it wouldve been squeezed into the same sociopathic postmodern alltooslick forgettable fare thats out there what fans seem to like about that movie is it has a very sweet heroic heart and it was catherine zetajoness first american film salary  cleopatra   see also other works  publicity listings  official sites  contact info getting started
