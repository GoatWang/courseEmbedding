marks  years at ballantyne strong  film journal international skip to main content advertisement diamond celebration ray boegner marks  years at ballantyne strong apr   tweetfeaturestechnology boegnerfeaturemdpng ray boegner is celebrating  years at omaha nebraskabased ballantyne strong inc—a span of time that has seen dramatic changes for both that cinema equipment company and the entire movie exhibition business but ballantyne strong has skillfully maneuvered through the transition from mm film to the digital world and continues to thrive as a leading force in cinema technology with boegner applying his experience and expertise as senior vp of projection and display film journal international had the pleasure of interviewing this affable and wellliked industry veteran whose life has taken him from the wideopen spaces of montana to vietnam from a service technician at oscarwinning optical radiation corporation to his current tech guru status in omaha so tell us about your beginnings and how you became involved with this industry i was born and raised in a small town in southwestern montana named dillon which oddly enough is the same town where tim warner cinemarks ceo attended college in fact tim used to eat the strawberry pie at the restaurant where my mom worked my career in sales actually started there as a paperboy going in and out of bars trying to get drunken sheepherders to buy the montana standard upon graduating from high school i enlisted in the air force and ended up spending four and half years serving in southeast asia between thailand and vietnam when i completed my military service in  i moved to southern california and went to work for new company called optical radiation corporation who just so happened to win the academy award that year for putting a xenon light source behind a film projector i had worked on airborne illumination systems in the air force the searchlights that would come off the back of an ac gunship optical radiation corporation was a bunch of guys that used to work for electrooptical systems which was part of xerox at the time—they left and started a company which made searchlights when i first went to work there they hired me to be a technician to service the searchlights and the first day i was there they said “you know xenon systems can you go over to consolidated film industries they’re having a problem with this lamphouse that we built” and next thing i knew i was servicing movie projectors instead of searchlights one of my first jobs was installing xenon lamp houses at theatres for the movie the godfather over the next nine years i completed my college education while working full time holding various engineering and sales positions within the company on both the west and east coasts of the us in  i left optical radiation and due to a noncompete clause could only moonlight in the cinema industry so i opted to try selling packaging equipment which ended up being a financial disaster for me personally but i had a lot of fun and learned a lot about other industries in  i went to work for a former coworker at optical radiation ron offerman who had started his own business called cinema film systems my title there was vice president of marketing but that wasnt saying i was important as there were only four employees in the company to begin with and two of them were ron and his wife in january of  i made the move to ballantyne accepting the position of east coast sales manager even though at that time i lived in los angeles i was promoted to vice president in the early ’s when ballantyne tried its hand at providing digital sound systems to the cinema industry when they were unsuccessful in that endeavor my concentration shifted to further developing the companys business in the international marketplace in  i was promoted to senior vice president of ballantyne and the promotion dictated a move from the los angeles area to ballantynes corporate headquarters in omaha a pretty big change from the hustlebustle of southern california but i can honestly say the only things i miss are the weather and the short golf season it is kind of refreshing to have people say hello and thank you and i actually do know my neighbors being in the industry for so many years you’ve seen it all what do you think is the biggest innovation of the past  years i think that far and away the biggest innovation on the equipment side has been the replacement of all the film projectors with digital projectors from a facility standpoint the newer buildings have become a destination that people enjoy going to with marble floors large concession stands comfortable chairs and good sound forty years ago the exhibitor’s mindset was how many screens they could cram into an existing big auditorium to make it a multiplex not really taking into account the comfort of their patrons as a person who started with film what do you think of the new digital technology the overall picture presentation of digital projection is fantastic both day one and three months down the road the changeover to digital has and will have a big effect on the exhibitors overall business model for in the old days they bought a new mm projector when they opened the theatre and they never replaced it until after their grandchildren died—they just kept buying parts to keep it running with the new digital technology they will need to change the system out realistically every ten years or so as the technology changes and the parts to keep it operating are no longer available do you get nostalgic for mm not really the worst part was during the digital conversion we installed every digital projector for regal when they converted—that’s  some machines and part of my installment agreement with them was…okay we’ll install the digital stuff we were leasing not selling and my idea was i’ll take back the mm stuff and if i can sell it for anything we’ll split the difference the sad part about that was to go out into our parking lot and see three or four hundred film projectors and consoles sitting there rusting and to think of the tens of thousands of hours that went into building them the scrap value was nothing—the only things of any value were the copper and the power supplies finally after a couple of thousands of units i reached an agreement with regal to start scrapping them locally rather than bringing them back to omaha i never sold a replacement mm projector never the only cases where i did was when somebody dropped a container or once a hurricane in cancun wiped out the theatre but i never sold one to replace a bad projector we sold a ton of parts and it was a big part of our business what major clients have you done business with in the us over the past  years i have enjoyed both business and personal relationships with both large and small exhibitors ranging from the big five to the small guy with a twin theatre out in central nebraska talk about the changes youve witnessed in the business and at strong i see the exhibitors constantly striving to improve the offerings of their venues the current trend is luxury reclining chairs and a bar in the lobby that serves alcohol twenty some years ago it was stadium seating then it was digital sound then the rebirth of d and it will continue to reinvent itself as technologies and trends dictate from a strong standpoint there have been dramatic changes in the last  years we have gone from the largest manufacturer of mm projectors in the world to one of the largest if not the largest distributor of complete cinema projection equipment in the world personally i preferred the manufacturing era better as i always felt we had more control on our future and related businesses we did make a great acquisition around eight years ago right at the outset of the new d era—we bought a premier screen manufacturing company named mdi and it has melded quite nicely into our overall business and is used around the world by exhibitors when did you start doing business in the international market strong has been in the international arena for many years and i personally have been involved in that market since joining strong my initial concentration was on the latin american market then europe during the ’s and a lot of time in asia over the last several years especially china what do you remember most about the growth of the international market new cinema construction in the us has been rather stagnant for some time it is true that new theatres are opening but on the flip side theatres are closing so the net increase if any is negligible china on the other hand has been opening in excess of  screens a year for the last three to four years if you look at real numbers of screens versus population you would assume that countries like brazil china and india are gold mines when it comes to cinema expansion on paper it looks to be the case but keep in mind that a large percentage of people in these areas cant afford a movie ticket regardless of the price and have never been to a theatre in their lives where in the global arena are you doing the most business while we sell on a global basis china is our largest single country where we are currently doing business and has been for the last five years where is the growth in motion pictures headed in the next five years the cinema exhibition industry is and always has been driven by the quality of the movies that they can offer the public to watch you can have the nicest theatre in the world with reclining seats marble floors and great lobby decorations but if you dont have a movie that someone wants to see they arent coming to your palace movies are still an inexpensive form of entertainment regardless of the price of a popcorn and coke just compare the price of going to a movie to going to a baseball game or other sporting event as the leases on the buildings built back in the ’s start running out the exhibitor is faced with the business decision to renew the lease walk away or build a new complex obviously i prefer the latter but for this to happen we need a few solid years of good movies so that hope can be given to a return on investment how has ballantyne met the needs of this marketplace historically ballantyne has always tried to provide what the cinema industry needed at the time—going back to the ’s when ballantyne manufactured over a halfmillion drivein car speakers in the ’s they tried their hand at selling foodservice equipment to the cinemas specifically chicken fryers only to find out that rats liked chicken bones tossed out of car windows during the early ’s we tried our hand at digital sound only to succumb to that company in san francisco whose name is synonymous with cinema sound when it became inevitable that digital projection was here to stay ballantyne teamed up with nec japan as a master distributor for the americas and later china thus providing a solution for our valued customers in the later part of  ballantyne purchased convergent media systems from sony thus providing our entry into the lobbysignage segment of the cinema ballantyne will continue to adapt to an everchanging cinema environment as they have for the past plus years which i have had the privilege of being part of for the last  years at the company tell us about meeting your wife… in the summer of  upon the completion of cinema expo in amsterdam phil rafnson mel hopland chuck goldwater and i decided we were going to try our hand at playing golf in scotland it was at the westin hotel in turnberry scotland that i ordered a gin and tonic from a young chinese waitress named lulu who would end up becoming my wife nine months later she was in scotland completing her internship in hotel and restaurant management while attending glion institute in switzerland i didnt really golf that well but the trip changed my life forever and only for the good we currently live right off of the th green at pacific springs golf course in omaha along with our dog appropriately named oscar  you see oscar  ran away one night a few years back when lulu was on her way to new york and i was on my way to mumbai india finally will you be at ballantyne for another  years maybe not  but i have every intention of being here for at least another ten i have no desire to leave interview conducted by kevin lally   saluting ray boegner “ray and i have been married for eleven years and life has never been better for us personally he is without a doubt one of the hardestworking individuals i have ever known he loves the challenges in the cinema industry and has passion for what he does i wonder sometimes whether he’d rather spend the rest of his life with btn or with me since i’ve known him his job has always been his top priority yet somehow he finds time for our family and his friends he is a man who has a heart of gold and i am truly blessed to be his wife” —lulu boegner “in all the trade shows we’ve been to from russia to las vegas i’m always amazed to see how many people ray knows in our business and how good his memory is you can be sure you’ll get a funny story if you take the time to share a drink or two with ray i have personally learned a lot on the business by working with ray and i want to thank him for that and for all the english lessons he gave me…” —françois barrette general manager mdi screen systems “i had just started in the industry with a mere two weeks under my belt when i attended my first showeast at merv griffin’s resort in atlantic city in october of  it was my first big meeting with a principal of then united artists theatres the biggest circuit in the world at the time and to say i was a little nervous would be a huge understatement since it was a morning meeting i was still waiting for the coffee to kick in as we boarded the elevator to ride up to the suite where the meeting was to be held who should be in the elevator car but john wilmers and ray boegner of course i knew who they were as they were my biggest competitor and had the lion’s share of the market in our product space i was introduced and john was his gentlemanly self when i was introduced to ray without missing a beat he said ‘so you’re the new mexican they hired’ as i mentioned it’s morning and the caffeine still hadn’t worked it’s magic so with rapierlike wit i answered ‘yes’ little did i know that with that first derogatory slur there would be countless more ray would become one of my best friends and a mentor in an industry that has become my second home congratulations pumpkin head with all the love and respect from your friends at mit” —joe delgado executive vp sales  marketing moving image technologies “ray boegner is a longterm partner of gdc and as such has made a huge contribution to the success of the company words are not enough to express the dedication that he has put into the film industry his industry expertise and business acumen have been invaluable and his largerthanlife personality has brightened the lives of all those he has worked with now as ray celebrates  years with ballantyne strong we would like to offer our sincere congratulations ray we wish you all the very best and look forward to working with you for many more years to come” —dr mannang chong chairman  ceo gdc technology “ray and i were traveling to lake geneva for either the variety or the mid states convention we flew to chicago and rented a car we were carrying our golf clubs because of the tournament at the event we were at the rentalcar place and we were putting our luggage in the car when i hear a loud scream from ray’s direction i hurried over to him and he had closed the car door on his hand he then drove dripping blood all the way to geneva dropped me off at the course and then went to the hospital he had seriously crushed his fingers and had to go through quite a bit of therapy to fix things” —john wilmers former president  ceo ballantyne strong “the first time i met ray as the new general manager of nec’s digital cinema division he came across as gruff brusque and ‘i know everyone in exhibition’ assertive my initial thoughts were mixed between ‘i need to work with this guy’ and ‘how can i work with this guy’ so much for first impressions  from that point in  to now ray and i worked on an amazing array of digitalcinema conversion deals he did indeed know everyone in exhibition and i learned to follow his lead he is one of the most persistent hardworking loyal and creative people in our business i owe a huge part of nec’s success in the north american digitalcinema market to ray boegner he truly changed the game for nec here’s to ray boegner a true friend a loyal colleague a fellow vet and an irrepressible salesman” —jim reisteter general manager digital cinema division nec display solutionsof america “years ago ray and i were both in beijing china at the birtv trade show this little guy with a fu manchu mustache was drawing on a greasy yellow piece of paper the dimensions of the strong projector ray somehow got a great photo of this guy’s face through the lens turret without him knowing ray would have given him the official drawings if he’d have asked while in china our host took us and a bunch of others to the great wall it was a really hot afternoon so when we got on the wall ray and i walked about  to  yards to a snack bar and purchased something cool to drink we sat in the shade staying cool that was the extent of our walk it was way too hot to walk very far those that did walk farther came back dripping with sweat” —clint koch sales director usl inc advertisement search filmjournal articles people industry guides search fb filmjournal film journal
