reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo kenneth j arrow receiving the nobel memorial prize in economic science in stockholm in  credit associated press kenneth j arrow one of the most brilliant economic minds of the th century and at  the youngest economist ever to win a nobel died on tuesday at his home in palo alto calif he was his son david confirmed the deathpaul a samuelson the first american to win the nobel memorial prize in economic science called professor arrow “the most important theorist of the th century in economics” when professor arrow received the award in  professor samuelson wrote “the economics of insurance medical care prescription drug testing — to say nothing of bingo and the stock market — will never be the same after arrow”professor arrow — a member of an extended family of distinguished economists including professor samuelson and lawrence h summers the former treasury secretary and adviser to president barack obama — generated work that was technically forbidding even to mathematically oriented colleaguesbut over the decades economists have learned to apply his ideas to the modern design of insurance products financial securities employment contracts and much more advertisement continue reading the main story markets and majoritiesthe backdrop for professor arrow’s influential early work was the centurieslong recognition that majority voting can produce arbitrary outcomes continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story consider a legislature choosing its leader from among three candidates alice betty and harry if the legislature were to vote first on alice versus betty with the winner running against harry it could come to a different decision than had it first started by voting on alice versus harry because the order with which the legislature takes votes is arbitrary the ultimate winner of this system of majority voting becomes arbitrary that puts politics in an awkward cornerin search of nonarbitrary outcomes social scientists proffered different ways to conduct votes for example the legislature could run all three candidates in the initial round and structure some type of runoff or the legislature could give each member multiple votes to be assigned to the three candidates in proportion to the intensity of the member’s preferencesbut no voting system however cleverly designed resolved the problems associated with majority voting in a theorem of stunning generality professor arrow proved that no system of majority voting worked satisfactorily according to a carefully articulated definition of “satisfactory” which social scientists generally acceptwhat professor arrow proved in his book “social choice and individual values”  was far more sweeping not only would majorityvoting rules prove unsatisfactory so too would nonvoting systems of making social choices if as was fundamental to his way of thinking those choices were based on the preferences of the individuals making up the society professor arrow’s rules did not allow for dictatorsthe arrow “impossibility theorem” ricocheted around the social sciences noteworthy for its use of abstract mathematical concepts to generate a conclusion of sweeping applicabilityprofessor arrow’s research opened the academic field of social choice — a literature that ranges from countries picking presidents to corporate boards picking business strategies having learned from him that no system works entirely well academics turned to challenging followup questions like whether some voting systems were better than othersprofessor arrow’s next major contributions for which he shared the  nobel memorial prize in economic science with the british economist john r hicks were published later in the s they took a bird’seye “general equilibrium” view of market economies setting out equations to capture the interplay between consumers and producers advertisement continue reading the main story the basic equations had been set out a halfcentury earlier by the french economist leon walras but professor arrow and his coauthors extended the walrasian system to capture important complexities like the fact that markets exist well into the future posing risk for consumers and producersprofessor arrow proved that their system of equations mathematically cohere prices exist that bring all markets into simultaneous equilibrium whereby every item produced at the equilibrium price would be voluntarily purchased and market competition puts society’s resources to good use competitive markets are efficient in the language of economistsprofessor arrow’s theorems set out the precise conditions under which adam smith’s famous conjecture in “the wealth of nations” holds true that the “invisible hand” of market competition among selfserving individuals serves society wellrelevance over decadesas was true of his earlier work on social choice the magnitude of professor arrow’s theoretical insight was staggering but he made clear his powerful conclusions about the workings of competitive markets held true only under ideal — that is to say unrealistic — assumptionshis assumptions for example ruled out the existence of thirdparty effects the sale of a product by harry to joe was assumed not to affect the wellbeing of sally — an assumption routinely violated in the real world by for example the sale of products that harm the environmentthe mathematics behind the general equilibrium proofs of professor arrow and his coauthors were daunting few economists mastered the details but franklin m fisher who taught graduate courses on general equilibrium at the massachusetts institute of technology acknowledged in a  interview with the new york times that all academic economists were in professor arrow’s intellectual debt professor arrow proved that the economists’ workaday tools of supplyanddemand equations are built on a logically coherent foundationhis later research translated commonsense ideas into elegant mathematics once the ideas were translated other economists could extend them in unanticipated directions photo president george w bush presenting professor arrow with the national medal of science at the white house in 6 credit pablo martinez monsivaisassociated press take “learning by doing” a notion that professor arrow examined in the early 6s the basic idea is straightforward the more that a company produces the smarter it gets decades later economists incorporated this idea into sophisticated theories of “endogenous growth” which have a country’s rate of economic growth depending on internal policies that promote innovation and education — the very forces that professor arrow’s writings anticipated advertisement continue reading the main story professor arrow also created mathematical concepts by which economists could measure and analyze risk william f sharpe who won a nobel in  for analyzing the relationship between financial risk and return credited professor arrow with helping to formulate the basis for modern theories of financial investment and corporate financeprofessor arrow he said belonged in the “pantheon” of investment management his ideas have worked their way into the design of complicated financial securities known as derivatives like options which give the owner the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified asset at a specified price on or before a specified date businesses buy and sell financial derivatives to protect themselves from financial turmoil and investors

us anytime professor arrow anticipated the modern analysis of markets in which buyers and sellers do not share accurate information now known as markets with asymmetric information in a strikingly prescient article published in the early 6s he teased apart the complexities that asymmetric information creates in the market for health insurance he pointed to incentives for patients and their physicians to agree to medical procedures of questionable value when a third party the insurer pays the billsprofessor arrow’s work spawned the modern treatment of “moral hazard” whereby the fact of the purchase of insurance systematically affects the behavior of the parties to the contractthe problems that professor arrow flagged a halfcentury ago figured prominently in the design of the affordable care act president barack obama’s  health care legislation including its controversial “individual mandate” which required everyone to buy coverage whether they expected to need medical care or notjoseph stiglitz who won the nobel in  for formalizing the study of markets with incomplete information traces his work to professor arrow’s initial foraysthe upshot the theorist who in the s proved that perfectly competitive markets could exist as a matter of mathematical logic spent much of the rest of his career showing how far short of perfection actual markets falla lifetime of learningkenneth joseph arrow was born on aug   in new york city after graduating from townsend harris high school in manhattan he raced through city college finishing with a bachelor’s degree in social science and in mathematics — what he called later “a paradoxical combination that was prognostic of my future interests”he did his graduate work at columbia university interrupting it to serve as a weather officer rising to captain in the army air corps during world war ii his first published paper “on the optimal use of winds for flight planning” drew on this experience advertisement continue reading the main story early in his career he worked at the rand corporation the research and development organization in santa monica calif in what he described as “the heady days of emerging game theory and mathematical programming”professor arrow spent the bulk of his career at stanford university except for a teaching stint at harvard from 6 to  he also served briefly on the staff of president john f kennedy’s council of economic advisershe retired from stanford in  but continued to accept shortterm appointments in europe and to serve on the external faculty and the science board of the santa fe institute a research center in new mexico focused on the interplay of the social and physical scienceshe led the american economic association served on the intergovernmental panel on climate change and in  was awarded the national medal of science the nation’s highest scientific honor presented in 6 by president george w bush“his politics are liberal definitely” said robert m solow a longtime friend and fellow nobel laureate in economics “with other people this might rub the right half of the economics profession the wrong way but it doesn’t with kenneth”professor arrow’s family members with ties to academic economics include his sister anita summers a professor emerita at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania her husband robert summers who died in  was also a noted professor of economics thererobert summers was the brother of paul samuelson and the father of lawrence summers who at  became a tenured economics professor at harvard and later served as the treasury secretary under president bill clinton as well as president of harvard and senior adviser to mr obamaprofessor arrow’s wife the former selma schweitzer whom he married in  died in  besides his sister and son david he is survived by another son andrew and a grandson advertisement continue reading the main story professor arrow was widely hailed as a polymath possessing prodigious knowledge of subjects far removed from economics eric maskin a harvard economist and fellow nobel winner told of a goodnatured conspiracy waged by junior faculty to get the better of professor arrow even if artificially they all agreed to study the breeding habits of gray whales — a suitably abstruse topic — and gathered at an appointed date at a place where professor arrow would be sure to visitwhen as expected he showed up they were talking out loud about the theory by a marine biologist — last name turner — which purported to explain how gray whales found the same breeding spot year after year as professor maskin recounted the story “ken was silent” and his junior colleagues amused themselves that they had for once bested their formidable professorwell not so fastbefore leaving professor arrow muttered “but i thought that turner’s theory was entirely discredited by spencer who showed that the hypothesized homing mechanism couldn’t possibly work”
