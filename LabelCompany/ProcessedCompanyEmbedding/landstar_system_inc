customer service and are delivered through a network of independent commission sales agents and third party capacity providers linked together by a series of technological applications which are provided and coordinated by the company the nature of the companys business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue landstar markets its integrated transportation management solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport customers freight landstars independent commission sales agents enter into contractual arrangements with the company and are responsible for locating freight making that freight available to landstars capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers the companys third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company under exclusive lease arrangements the bco independent contractors unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the company under nonexclusive contractual arrangements the truck brokerage carriers air cargo carriers ocean cargo carriers and railroads through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by landstars information technology systems landstar operates an integrated transportation management solutions business primarily throughout north america with revenue of  billion during the most recently completed fiscal year the company reports the results of

companys consolidated revenue for the twentysixweek period ended june   changes in financial condition and results of operations management believes the companys success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent commission sales agents and to safely and efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers management believes the most significant factors to the companys success include increasing revenue sourcing capacity and controlling costs including insurance and claims while customer demand which is subject to overall economic conditions ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue the company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities managements emphasis with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate  million or more of landstar revenue million dollar agents management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by million dollar agents and the number of million dollar agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents during the  fiscal year  independent commission sales agents generated  million or more of landstar revenue and thus qualified as million dollar agents during the  fiscal year the average revenue generated by a million dollar agent was  and revenue generated by million dollar agents in the aggregate represented  of consolidated revenue management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads volume and revenue per load by mode of transportation revenue per load can be influenced by many factors other than a change in price those factors include the average length of haul freight type special handling and

administering its business operations management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the company and establishes annual cost budgets which in general are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis purchased transportation represents the amount a bco independent contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight the amount of purchased transportation paid to a bco independent contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreedupon percentage of revenue generated by delivered loads the bco independent contractor hauled purchased transportation paid to a truck brokerage carrier is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or to a lesser extent a contractually agreedupon fixed rate per load purchased transportation paid to railroads is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreedupon fixed rate purchased transportation paid to air cargo carriers is generally based on a negotiated rate for each load hauled and purchased transportation paid to ocean cargo carriers is generally based on contractually agreedupon fixed rates purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage rail intermodal and ocean cargo services is normally higher than that of bco independent contractor and air cargo services purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and on a consolidated basis increases or decreases as a percentage of consolidated revenue in proportion to changes in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated through bco independent contractors and other third party capacity providers and external revenue from the insurance segment consisting of reinsurance premiums purchased transportation as a percent of revenue also increases or decreases in relation to the availability of truck brokerage capacity and with changes in the price of fuel on revenue hauled by truck brokerage carriers purchased transportation costs are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery    table of contents commissions to agents are based on contractually agreedupon percentages of revenue or net revenue defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation or net revenue less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by landstar commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation and reinsurance premiums and with changes in net revenue margin defined as net revenue divided by revenue on services provided by truck brokerage carriers railroads air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers commissions to agents are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery the company defines gross profit as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents gross profit divided by revenue is referred to as gross profit margin the companys operating margin is defined as operating income divided by gross profit in general gross profit margin on revenue hauled by bco independent contractors represents a fixed percentage of revenue due to the nature of the contracts that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to both the bco independent contractors and independent commission sales agents for revenue hauled by truck brokerage carriers gross profit margin is either fixed or variable as a percent of revenue depending on the contract with each individual independent commission sales agent under certain contracts with independent commission sales agents the company retains a fixed percentage of revenue and the agent retains the amount remaining less the cost of purchased transportation the retention contracts gross profit margin on revenue hauled by railroads air cargo carriers ocean cargo carriers and truck brokerage carriers other than those under retention contracts is variable in nature as the companys contracts with independent commission sales agents provide commissions to agents at a contractually agreed upon percentage of net revenue for these type of loads approximately  of the companys consolidated revenue in the twentysixweek period ended june   was generated under contracts that have a fixed gross profit margin while  was under contracts that have a variable gross profit margin maintenance costs for companyprovided trailing equipment and bco independent contractor recruiting costs are the largest components of other operating costs also included in other operating costs are trailer rental costs the provision for uncollectible advances and other receivables due from bco independent contractors and independent commission sales agents and gainslosses if any on sales of companyowned trailing equipment with respect to insurance and claims cost potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable for commercial trucking claims landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence the company also retains liability of up to  for each general liability claim  for each workers compensation claim and up to  for each cargo claim the companys exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by truck brokerage carriers railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents cargo claims or workers compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on landstars cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations during the twentysixweek period ended june   employee compensation and benefits accounted for over sixty percent of the companys selling general and administrative costs depreciation

discussion of indirect costs as a percentage of gross profit is useful and meaningful to potential investors for the following principal reasons  disclosure of these relative measures ie each indirect operating cost line item as a percentage of gross profit allows investors to better understand the underlying trends in the companys results of operations  due to the generally fixed nature of these indirect costs other than insurance and claims costs these relative measures are meaningful to investors evaluations of the companys management of its indirect costs attributable to operations  management considers this financial information in its decisionmaking such as budgeting for infrastructure trailing equipment and selling general and administrative costs and  this information facilitates comparisons by investors of the companys results to the results of other nonasset or assetlight companies in the transportation and logistics services industry who report net revenue in management discussion and analysis which represents revenue less the cost of purchased transportation the difference between the companys use of the term gross profit and use of the term net revenue by other companies in the transportation and logistics services industry is due to the direct cost of commissions to agents under the landstar business model whereas other companies in this industry generally have no commissions to agents also as previously mentioned the company reports two operating segments the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment external revenue at the insurance segment representing reinsurance premiums has historically been relatively consistent on a yearoveryear basis at less than  of consolidated revenue and generally corresponds directly with the number of trucks provided by bco independent contractors the discussion of indirect cost line items in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations considers the companys costs on a consolidated basis rather than on a segment basis management believes this presentation format is the most appropriate to assist users of the financial statements in understanding the companys business for the following reasons  the insurance segment has no other operating costs  discussion of insurance and claims at either segment without reference to the other may create confusion amongst investors and potential investors due to intercompany arrangements and specific deductible programs that affect comparability of financial results by segment between various fiscal periods but that have no effect on the company from a consolidated reporting perspective  selling general and administrative costs of the insurance segment comprise less than  of consolidated selling general and administrative costs and have historically been relatively consistent on a yearoveryear basis and  the insurance segment has no depreciation and amortization twenty

was primarily due to increased rail intermodal loads the decrease in revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers was primarily due to a decreased revenue per load on rail intermodal loads and an increase in intermodal loads as a percentage of multimode loads as intermodal loads generally generate a lower revenue per load compared to loads hauled by ocean or air cargo

matters the company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business many of these claims are covered in whole or in part by insurance based on knowledge of the facts and in certain cases opinions of outside counsel management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome after provisions therefor will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year critical accounting policies and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents managements estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected historically managements estimates for uncollectible receivables have been materially correct although management believes the amount of the allowance for both trade and other receivables at june   is appropriate a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of these receivables in addition liquidity concerns andor unanticipated bankruptcy proceedings at any of the companys larger customers in which the company is carrying a significant receivable could result in an increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables and have a significant impact on the companys results of operations in a given quarter or year however it is not expected that an uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from an individual customer would have a significant impact on the companys financial condition conversely a more robust economic environment or the recovery of a previously provided for uncollectible receivable from an individual customer may result in the realization of some portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables landstar provides for the estimated costs of selfinsured claims primarily on an actuarial basis the amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date the ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management the company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim historically the company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior years claims estimates during the  and  twentysixweek periods insurance and claims costs included  and  of net unfavorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates respectively the unfavorable development of prior years claims in the  fiscal period primarily related to a single claim for which the company incurred a pretax charge of  it is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims reserve at june   the company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes if the company were to be subject to an audit it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes certain of these tax planning strategies result in a level of uncertainty as to whether the related tax positions taken by the company would result in a recognizable benefit the company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to such tax positions due to the corresponding level of uncertainty with respect to the amount of income tax benefit that may ultimately be realized management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the uncertainty in certain income tax positions is appropriate to date the company has not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the companys past provisions for exposures related to the uncertainty of such income tax positions are not appropriate significant variances from managements estimates for the amount of uncollectible receivables the ultimate resolution of selfinsured claims and the provision for uncertainty in income tax positions could each be expected to positively or negatively affect landstars earnings in a given quarter or year however management believes that the ultimate resolution of these items given a range of reasonably likely outcomes will not significantly affect the longterm financial condition of landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations    table of contents effects of inflation management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of landstar in the past five years however inflation in excess of historic trends might have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations in the future seasonality landstars operations

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could
