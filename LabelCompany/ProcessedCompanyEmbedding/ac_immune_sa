for the treatment of alzheimers disease is huge and ac immune looks like a compelling speculative buy amyloid hypothesis the leading hypothesis for the cause and treatment of alzheimers disease is the amyloid hypothesis betaamyloid is a microscopic brain protein fragment that can accumulate in the brain disrupt communication between brain cells and eventually kill them some researchers believe that flaws in the processes governing production accumulation or disposal of betaamyloid are the primary cause of alzheimer’s according to the alzheimers association many drugs are in development based on this hypothesis but they have faced some high profile setbacks in the past year in late november of  eli lillys nyselly solanezumab failed to meet its primary objective in its phase  trial but as the data from the trial was released two weeks later hopes were renewed from an article in marketwatch eli lilly’s solanezumab didn’t meet its primary endpoint which was for patients to show less of a cognitive decline but secondary endpoints — which showed the drug’s effect on other measures of function and cognition — were statistically significant leaving “hope in the betaamyloid hypothesis for remaining candidates” said leerink partners’ paul matteis “amyloid hypothesis lives to see another day” proclaimed jp morgan’s cory kasimov matteis went on to rate the odds of success for ac immunes crenezumab at  in late february merck nysemrk pulled the plug on trials of their own candidate verubecestat after an outside committee concluded that it had virtually no chance of helping patients with the disease while the eli lilly results were mixed the failure by merck was a clear negative for the amyloid hypothesis according to an article appearing in business insider though there is growing belief that some of these trials may have failed because they have been treating patients too late research has determined that years — even decades — before a person might start showing symptoms amyloid beta deposits in the brain that are characteristic of alzheimers disease can start to accumulate the current suggestion is to begin treatment of the disease in its early stages while patients are still presymptomatic this new focus offers some hope to a scientific approach that has produced many failures thus far one recently completed study of a population in eastern finland with a genetic mutation offers support for the amyloid hypothesis and for potential preventive treatments and made news at the end of june according to science daily the findings from the population cohort in eastern finland show that a lifelong decrease in betaamyloid levels is not associated with detrimental effects on lipid or glucose metabolism or on any other metabolically relevant events furthermore the findings also provide support for the amyloid cascade hypothesis a hypothesis which is key in alzheimers research and which has recently been heavily questioned due to failed betaamyloid based drug trials and treatment experiments so despite the setbacks of other drugs based on the amyloid hypothesis the hypothesis lives on while there is significant dissent in the scientific community it remains the leading hypothesis on the cause and potential treatment of alzheimers disease ac immune ac immune is a swissbased pharmaceutical company that was founded in  and had its ipo in september  they have partnered with genentech a subsidiary of roche on their leading candidate for treating and preventing alzheimers disease the latest update from their st quarter  financial results showed chf  million in cash and cash equivalents all results are reported in swiss francs which are at close to parity with us dollars at the moment with their high cash balance the company appears well positioned for further development of its pipeline in addition to their partnership with genentech they have partnerships with janssen of johnson  johnson nysejnj biogen nasdaqbiib and piramal healthcare on other candidates in each financial statement ac immune prefaces the discussion of revenues with our revenues experience significant fluctuations as a result of securing new collaboration agreements the timing of milestone achievements and the size of each milestone payment the lumpiness of the revenues and the variability of the rd costs make it difficult to determine precisely how long the cash runway is in  for instance the company had positive earnings as it received chf  million in revenues primarily from its collaboration with genentech and had chf  million in expenses in  they raised chf  million from their ipo and increased their spending on rd they had total revenues of only chf  million from four different collaborations while expenses rose to chf  million in the first quarter of  the company reported revenues of chf  million and expenses of chf  million ac immune priced a secondary offering of  million shares at  per share on march  and that  million does not appear to be reflected in the cash balance of their st quarter results this should bring them up to roughly chf  million in cash at the beginning of the nd quarter even if we assumed a relatively high burn rate of chf  million per year based on the st quarter  results this would get them into  well beyond the expected end date of the phase  trials of crenezumab source investor presentation while much is made of their leading candidate they also have multiple candidates based on the competing tau hypothesis of ad treatment as well as candidates designed to treat down syndrome glaucoma and parkinsons disease this added diversification provides some downside protection in the event that crenezumab fails in phase  high reward this infographic from the alzheimers association makes clear the large potential market for treatment and prevention of the disease there are currently only a handful of drugs cleared by the fda to treat alzheimers disease and they are focused on treating the symptoms the current market for alzheimers treatment is estimated to be several billion dollars but could grow considerably if a drug that successfully treats or prevents the disease is approved while odds are against any given candidate the potential payoff is huge ac immunes ipo price was  in september of  and it soared  on the first day in recent months however ac immune has fallen below its ipo price and continues to struggle in the markets it is now down  from its ipo and secondary offering prices aciu data by ychartswith no negative news coming out of the companys own drug trials and with the stock trading at a significant discount to its ipo price this looks like it could be a good entry point while the stock has been trading lower on skepticism about the amyloid hypothesis and the results of other drug companies ac immune and genentech remain optimistic about crenezumab crenezumab is significantly different from other candidates as the ac immune ceo andrea pfeifer described in a recent article published in march pfeifers optimism around crenezumab stems from its safety profile – it can be safely dosed up to  mgkg thats four times the dose that was employed in two phase ii trials which failed to demonstrate statistically significant efficacy in the overall study population but which showed a clear separation between drug and placebo in a subgroup of patients with mild disease see bioworld today july   jefferies analyst peter welford supports ac immunes rationale unlike other prominent abeta antibodies such as aducanumab and sola that have an igg backbone crenezumab contains an igg backbone he wrote in a research note this week importantly this igg backbone results in clearance of abeta without inducing an inflammatory response enabling use of higher doses and a better sideeffect profile higher doses should result in increased brain exposure and therefore potentially greater efficacy this is not an assumption or a hypothesis we have shown it pfeifer said the ongoing phase iii cread trial is employing that high dose so too will the second phase iii trial which like the first will also recruit  patients with early stage disease with less side effects allowing for higher doses and with trials comprised of patients in earlier stages of the disease there is a compelling argument for success where other companies have failed genentech is optimistic enough to begin conducting a second phase  trial in addition to these there is also a phase  preventive trial on a group with genetic susceptibility to early onset alzheimers that should provide some preliminary results later in the year high risk while the upside in royalty payments is large if they succeed in creating an fda approved treatment for alzheimers disease there is significant risk as well ac immune is a young company that has never taken a candidate through to commercialization so there is execution risk the science of alzheimers disease is uncertain so it is entirely possible that increases in betaamyloid in the brain of alzheimers patients is a side effect and not a cause of the disease or its symptoms if this turns out to be the case then ac immunes leading candidate will amount to nothing there is also a risk that even if the amyloid hypothesis holds true that crenezumab could fail to deliver the promised results investing in ac immune is definitely a gamble but at the current depressed prices with a promising differentiated candidate for treating alzheimers disease and a strong business model i like the odds it is a speculative investment with high risk and high potential reward so while i have recently bought shares in the company my allocation is small at slightly over  of my portfolio conclusion despite the recent failures of other candidates to successfully treat alzheimers disease crenezumab remains a promising candidate ac immune has strong partnerships a broadening pipeline and a significant cash balance trading at  below its ipo price it looks like a good speculative investment disclosure i amwe are long aciu i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am
