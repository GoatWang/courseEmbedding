methods for testing household biomass cookstoves are required to develop standards needed by international policy makers donors and investors application of consistent test practices allows emissions and energy efficiency performance to be benchmarked and enables meaningful comparisons among traditional and advanced stove types in this study  cookstoves burning six fuel types wood charcoal pellets corn cobs rice hulls and plant oil at two fuel moisture levels were examined under laboratorycontrolled operating conditions as outlined in the water boiling test wbt protocol version  pollutant emissions carbon dioxide carbon monoxide methane total hydrocarbons and ultrafine particles were continuously monitored fine particle mass was measured gravimetrically for each wbt phase additional measurements included cookstove power energy efficiency and fuel use emission factors are given on the basis of fuel energy cooking energy fuel mass time and cooking task or activity the lowest pm
