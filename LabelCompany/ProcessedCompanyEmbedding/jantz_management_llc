privacy legal home strategy products value portfolios esg portfolios  and fossil free portfolios people company contact homestrategyproducts    value portfolios    esg portfolios     and fossil free portfoliospeoplecompanycontact investment strategyhome  investment strategy jantz management’s investment strategy is to develop quantitative models that synthesize fundamental financial principles and market dynamics to estimate a firm’s longterm value using these models investment opportunities are detected where current market price and a company’s value are misaligned by holding an appropriate number of these opportunities the aggregate portfolio’s performance will be greater than the relevant index but with similar risk characteristics gains are harvested on a prescribed periodic basis and no fund will be allowed to grow beyond its efficient size quantitative methodology fundamental to the firm’s approach is the use of system dynamics developed by jay w forrester professor emeritus mit system dynamics is a powerful tool for modeling complex systems where feedback time delays and qualitative information are important in understanding the system’s dynamic behavior this discipline provides the methodological framework allowing the integration of key financial concepts and market structures into models that can be tested and improved over time dynamic probabilistic parameterization is used to calibrate a handful of important factors within the system dynamics models with great care taken to avoid data mining each company’s current and historic financial data is put through the model to determine if its stock is mispriced in the marketplace systematic application across an asset class results in a rigorous and dispassionate process that leaves no opportunity undiscovered discipline jantz management distinguishes itself through its disciplined adherence to the models and processes – investment decisions are made based on the sound fundamentals embodied in the models not hype or emotion values jantz management seeks to provide its clients with choice in the values they wish to have reflected in their investment portfolios for that reason the set of values reflected in the firm’s various portfolios are distinct nonetheless all the firm’s portfolios have at their core models developed using our quantitative methodology  and

as others have demonstrated that on average value investing outperforms growth investing where “value” is synonymous with “cheap” and “growth” is synonymous with “expensive” in this context “value” is often defined by a low ratio of stock price to the book value of the company while “growth” is identified as a high price to book ratio jantz management improves and redefines “value” as valuation jm’s dynamic valuation methodology simulates future growth in its estimates of the value of each stock in the investable universe jm’s forecast of stock value is used to estimate the expected rate of return and dispersion risk relative to its current market price in general jm uses a statistical technique to optimize the proportion of each stock held in the portfolio such that the expected portfolio risk is minimized for given portfolio requirements portfolio requirements including a required level for the portfolio’s expected rate of return are entered into the optimization process as constraints the resulting model folios are used to change the portfolio weights for a target portfolio jm’s strategy emphasizes adherence to the quantitative models and processes and it is designed to remove many of the human cognitive limitations and biases that inhibit portfolio performance management for total return rather than to a benchmark also increases the performance capabilities of the firm’s portfolios consequently the portfolio does not track the benchmark and for short periods can even underperform it nevertheless the result is a potentially higher average level of return at a level of risk designed to be approximately that of the comparable index fund benchmark further jm’s quantitative optimization approach to portfolio construction is sector agnostic allowing the fund to capture the full benefit of market inefficiencies that cause securities to be underpriced or overpriced without regard to industry sector risk is reduced through diversification by holding positions in a substantial number of equities – ranging from  to  depending on the portfolio the size of each position is weighted to enhance the riskadjusted return to the portfolio with target weights at the time of portfolio rebalance of no greater than  finally profits are taken based on monthly reevaluations of the entire set of index constituents value portfolios seek to significantly outperform the
