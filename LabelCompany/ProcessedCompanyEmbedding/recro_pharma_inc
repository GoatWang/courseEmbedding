therapeutics market  recro pharma inc reph home therapeutics market therapeutics market postoperative pain market overview based upon statistics from the national center for health statistics it is estimated that there are over  million surgeries performed in the united states each year of these surgeries we believe at least  million procedures as referenced by the national center for health statistics require postoperative pain medication while opioids are generally considered the most effective treatment for postoperative pain they raise serious concerns due to addiction illicit use respiratory depression and other side effects including constipation nausea vomiting and intolerance due to their addictive potential opioids are regulated as controlled substances and are listed on schedule ii and iii by the dea as a result of these side effects pain sufferers or their treating physicians tend to limit their use of opioids resulting in as many as  of postoperative patients reporting inadequate pain relief this reduces the quality of life for individuals and creates an economic burden estimated to be at least  to  billion a year in medical costs and lost productivity according to a january  article in the new england journal of medicine overdose deaths from prescription painkillers defined to mean opioid or narcotic pain relievers has increased significantly over the past  years it notes the following trends prescription painkiller overdoses killed  people in the united states in  in  about  million americans age  or older reported nonmedical use of prescription painkillers in the past year and emergency department visits involved with misusing or abusing prescription opioid painkillers increased  between  and  we believe that injectable meloxicam offers an attractive alternative for pain relief without the risks associated with opioids accordingly we believe that physicians and thirdparty payors including medicare and medicaid are highly interested in new nonopioid pain therapies that provide effective pain relief without the adverse issues associated with opioids overview  recro pharma inc reph home product pipeline overview

november   is a clinicalstage specialty pharmaceutical company the company is engaged in developing products for hospitals and ambulatory care settings that is developing nonopioid products for treatment of serious acute pain the companys lead product candidate is an injectable form of meloxicam the companys product candidates for pain indications include injectable meloxicam a product candidate in development for the treatment of acute postoperative pain dexin a product candidate under development for the treatment of postoperative pain dexsl a product candidate for the treatment of chronic pain and fadolmidine fado a product candidate used by injection into the spine for pain associated with surgery or certain types of chronic pain and which the company pursues as a topical product for local application to treat serious pain associated with nerve damage to local tissues neuropathies especially of the lower extremities which can occur in diabetic patients the companys manufacturing and development capabilities include formulation through process development scaleup and fullscale commercial manufacturing and specialized capabilities for the development and manufacturing of controlled substancesmeloxicamthe companys meloxicam is a longacting preferential cox inhibitor that possesses antiinflammatory analgesic and antipyretic activities which are believed to be related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase cox and subsequent reduction in prostaglandin biosynthesis meloxicam has been marketed by boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals inc as an oral agent mobic mobic tablets and suspension are indicated for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and the relief of the signs and symptoms of pauciarticular or polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients over two years meloxicam has a slow onset of action orally the oral form has a prolonged absorption time with the time of maximum observed plasma concentration or tmax being approximately  hours following oral administration which is consistent with its poor aqueous solubility its injectable form of the drug which utilizes nanocrystal technology provides a faster onset of action of meloxicam thus providing a rapid and sustained treatment of acute pain via the intravenous iv or intramuscular im administration routes meloxicam has completed multiple phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe paindexmedetomidinethe companys dex is a selective alpha adrenergic agonist that has demonstrated sedative analgesic and anxiolytic properties the dex effect on alpha sub receptors differs from clonodine resulting in lower propensity to lower blood pressure in its clinical trials completed todate the company has observed some hypotensive activity on hypotension dex has demonstrated a safe intravenous use in acute and surgical settings utilizing its sedative properties the company has formulated dex at a lower dose perhaps as low as th for its intranasal product than the recommended iv dosage levels the companys dex has completed phase ii trialsfadolmidinethe companys second compound under development fado also belongs to the alpha adrenergic agonist receptor class fado is similar to dex and different from clonidine in that it is a full agonist of all subtypes of alpha adrenoreceptor fado does not cross the blood brain barrier and this accounts for the targeting of fado use for either it administration for pain or anesthesia or potentially for topical use to treat pain associated with regional nerve pain from underlying nerve damage also called neuropathies various preclinical models of pain have been employed and have demonstrated fados potential as an analgesic including its potential for use in neuropathies and postoperative pain the safety and efficacy of fado had been assessed in one phase i study and in one phase ii studythe company competes with johnson  johnson purdue pharma lp endo
