present same  center noi as a supplemental measure of our performance we define noi as total operating revenues adjusted to exc lude lease buy  out income and non  cash revenue items less property operating expenses and real estate taxes same  center noi represents the noi for the   properties for peco i and  for pelp that were owned and operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods except for those proper tie s we currently classify as redevelopment a property is removed from the same  center pool and classified as redevelopment when it is being repositioned in the market and such repositioning is expected to have a significant impact on property operating income while there is judgment surrounding chan ges in designations once a redevelopment property has stabilized it is typically moved to the same  center pool the following year currently we have iden tified five properties that we classify as redevelopment properties we believe that noi and same  center noi provide useful information to our investors about our financial and operating performanc e because each provides a performance measure of the revenues and expenses directly involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provides a per spective not immediately apparent from net income because same  center noi excludes the change in noi from properties acquired after december   and those considered redevelopment properties it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels rental rates and operating costs on properties that wer e o perational for both comparable periods other reits may use different methodologies for calculating same  center noi and accordingly our same  center noi may not be com parable to other reits same  center noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it does not reflect the operat ions of our entire portfolio nor does it reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses acquisition

chief operating officer of phillips edison grocery center reit one thank you for joining us on today’s webinar to discuss phillips edison grocery center reit one’s proposed acquisition of phillips edison limited partnership   before we begin i would like to remind you that statements made during this call may contain forwardlooking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties please refer to slides  and  for additional disclosure and direction on where you can find more information regarding potential risks in addition we will also refer today to certain nongaap financial

results are available in our sec filings as well as the end of this presentation   for more information please refer to the form k which will be filed with the sec today which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forwardlooking statements   also please note that during this call we will be referring to phillips edison grocery center reit one as “peco one” and we will be referring to phillips edison limited partnership as “pelp”   slide  outlines today’s agenda we will start with a review of the transaction then move to an overview of pelp then speak to the pro forma combined company and finally i will address how all of this impacts our liquidity   turning to slide  on may   peco one announced that it entered into a definitive contribution agreement to acquire the real estate assets and the asset management business of its sponsor and external advisor pelp in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately  billion this strategic acquisition will result in the largest internallymanaged nontraded groceryanchored shopping center reit in the us   pelp was founded in  and since its inception has been focused on groceryanchored shopping centers currently there are two major parts to pelp’s business – one part owns shopping centers and the other provides real estate asset management services to pelp’s wholly owned properties as well as to a number of third parties including peco one a snapshot of the company is provided on slide    when the transaction is complete as you will see on slide  peco one will own  shopping centers and also own an asset manager which will provide services to peco one’s wholly owned properties as well as additional third party properties   slide   provides some details on the two entities before the merger peco i is currently an externally managed nontraded reit with estimated  billion total enterprise value it owns  shopping centers with  million square feet of gross leasable area it’s ipo closed in  raising b   pelp is a vertically integrated owner and operator of  shopping centers that has been exclusively focused on groceryanchored shopping centers since inception in  pelp also has an asset management platform which advises approximately b of groceryanchored shopping center assets including peco one   as you will see on slide   the resulting company will have a total enterprise value of approximately  billion and will be exclusively focused on groceryanchored shopping centers – just like we are in peco one   the combined company will own a highquality nationallydiversified portfolio of  shopping centers located in  states with over  million square feet of gross leasable area or gla           additionally we are acquiring pelp’s asset management business which manages over  billion of third party real estate and which generates annual revenue of approximately  million   the transaction which is expected to close during the fourth quarter of  will provide for meaningful synergies including   • a projected accretion of  to  percent for pro forma ffo per share for the first quarter of  compared to standalone peco one for the same period   • secondly our estimated pro forma dividend coverage is expected to exceed  percent on an ffo to total dividends basis which would be up from  percent for standalone peco one for the first quarter of     • importantly now that we will be an internally managed reit we will be much better positioned for capital market opportunities which include a potential future liquidity event   now turning to slide  in exchange for pelp’s  shopping centers and asset management business pelp will receive approximately  million operating partnership units or “op units” in peco one’s operating partnership phillips edison grocery center operating partnership one lp as well as  million in cash additionally peco one will assume or refinance  million of pelp’s debt this brings the total value of the transaction to approximately  billion   it is important to note that this transaction does not include any internalization fees meaning that no fees will be paid in respect of ongoing management advisory services provided by pelp to peco one additionally peco one’s management is not receiving any cash consideration  in fact  percent of the cash will be used to retire certain minority partnership interests in order to ensure that the combined company maintains its qualification as a reit   in addition to the equity consideration due at the closing of the transaction there are two major performancebased earnouts which incentivize future action and performance   the first earnout which can potentially be valued at  million additional op units will be earned if a liquidity event for peco one is achieved   the second earnout which can potentially be valued at  million additional op units can be earned based on achievement of certain fundraising targets for peco three which we believe will be assisted to a degree by a successful liquidity event   post transaction company management will own  million units of the combined company before any earnouts and will be peco one’s largest equity holder once the transaction closes management will be subject to a significant lockup period   as you can see this equitybased consideration aligns management with stockholders and preserves capital for future investments   although a stockholder vote is not required for this transaction we do intend to receive stockholder approval before proceeding with the transaction it is our goal to provide our investors with the appropriate approval opportunity and transparency around this transaction as such more information will be provided to you via a definitive proxy statement which we expect to be mailed to you as well as filed with the sec during july   the board of directors of the company has recommended that you to vote in favor of the transaction and believe it is in the best interest of the company          now let’s turn to slide   as i touched on earlier one of the main benefits to this transaction is that it is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings again we expect an accretion of  to  percent for pro forma ffo per share for the first quarter of  compared to standalone peco one for the same period   our estimated pro forma dividend coverage is expected to exceed  percent on an ffo to total dividends basis which is up from  percent for standalone peco i for the first quarter of    upon the closing of the transaction we expect there to be  million equity shares of peco one common stock and  million pelpowned peco one op units outstanding both the common stock and the op units are valued at  per share   peco one stockholders are expected to own  percent of the combined company and pelp stockholders are expected to own  percent of the combined company   additionally the combined company will have a total debt of  billion which includes peco one’s  billion of debt and pelp’s  million of debt which will be assumed and or refinanced in this transaction   this will result in a company with a total enterprise value of approximately  billion   we anticipate our leverage on a debt to total enterprise value basis will be approximately  percent which is a figure we are comfortable with   of the outstanding debt  percent will be fixed rate debt and  percent will be floating rate debt the weighted average interested rate will fall between  percent and  percent with a weighted average term that includes options of  to  years   now i would like to provide you some details on the real estate which we are acquiring from pelp on slide     peco one is acquiring  retail shopping centers in  states which total  million square feet these shopping centers are highly complementary to the shopping centers that we own in peco one as they have a similar anchor lineup a high level of exposure to national and regional tenants and a preference for necessity based service providers like grocers these properties have demonstrated a stable growing cash flow profile over the company’s history   further pelp and peco one share four out of five top grocers by abr – these include kroger safewayalbertsons ahold delhaize and giant eagle   the resulting company’s gla profile will be over  percent grocery anchored and its overall portfolio will benefit from a strong mix of national and regional tenants   as we have mentioned the resulting combined company is expected to see an estimated increase in its pro forma ffo per share of approximately  to  percent for the first quarter of  compared to standalone peco one for the same period   turning to slide  pelp has a total of b of real estate assets under management as of december     these assets generate regular fees for pelp which totaled approximately  million for  this consistent asset management fee stream is generated from our nontraded reits and necessity retail partners a valueadded joint venture between phillips edison grocery center reit two and tpg real estate            further pelp has sponsored  third party funds since  which have raised over  billion of equity capital from a variety of sources including high net worth investors institutional investors and public nontraded reits   the chart below illustrates the growth in both pelp’s total real estate assets under management as well as its fee stream back in  pelp had approximately  million of assets under management and generated annual fee income of approximately  million since then pelp has grown significantly and now has approximately  billion of assets and generates annual fee income of over  million   slide  provides a quick snapshot of the pro forma real estate portfolio the combined company will own a highquality nationallydiversified portfolio of  shopping centers located in  states totaling over  million square feet these properties have a leased occupancy of  percent and generate  percent of their abr from grocers national tenants and regional tenants   additionally the top three anchor tenants of the combined company are all grocers – kroger publix and albertsons – safeway these three tenants combine for approximately  percent of our total abr and account for  stores   turning to slide  for the next step in this transaction a proxy statement will be mailed to you which we expect to occur in july this statement will include detailed pro forma financials on the combined company as well as the proxy which will allow you to submit your vote to approve this transaction assuming we get approval and receive the necessary debt consents during september the transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of    turning to slide  in summary we believe the strategic acquisition of pelp will create the largest internallymanaged groceryanchored shopping center reit   this transaction includes a number of benefits which are as follows   • it is expected to be immediately accretive to ffo per share and is expected to improve our dividend coverage   • it will strengthen our balance sheet and increase our future earnings growth potential   • cost synergies will be realized through our internal management structure and   • it will improve our valuation potential with our increased earnings larger scale and internalized manager   now on slide    • the transaction does not have internalization fees meaning that no fees will be paid in respect of ongoing management advisory services provided by pelp to peco one   • the asset management fees will provide consistent predictable income through market cycles   • equitybased transaction enhances reit i’s capital position and better aligns management with the shareholders   • management will own over  million shares of the combined company excluding the earnout and will be the biggest shareholder of reit one and   • and our managed portfolios provide an embedded acquisition pipeline with increased opportunities for growth   turning to slide  our goal is to provide liquidity to our stockholders and we believe this transaction is a major step toward that event we remain one of the only public reits that has an exclusive focus on groceryanchored shopping centers which we believe is the most attractive space in shopping center real estate the transaction clearly reflects that our integrated veteran management team is vested in the success of peco one this is a very positive step toward a liquidity event for peco i stockholders   and as a reminder it remains our intention to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event not later than three to five years after the termination of our primary offering which was in february           we encourage you to read the press release that was issued today as well as the related sec filings which are both available on our website grocery center reit numeral  com   if you have further questions we

settlements of pre  existing relationships  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and impairment charges and after related adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships joint ventures
