assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized   any deferred tax asset is considered immaterial and has been fully offset by a valuation allowance

classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the company cannot continue as a going concern management anticipates that it will be able to raise additional working capital

which relate to future operations strategies financial results or other developments forwardlooking statements are based upon estimates forecasts and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control and many of which with respect to future business decisions are subject to change these uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf we disclaim any obligation to update forwardlooking statements   overview   we were incorporated under the name greenwind nrg inc in the state of nevada on february   we are a developmentstage company and we have no revenues and no assets as a result we have incurred losses since inception our limited operations to date have consisted of the formation of the company the raising of capital maintaining our public company reporting requirements on march   a registration statement on form s was declared effective for the registration of  shares of our common stock as of october   we had sold  shares pursuant to this registration statement and the offering has been completed   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months this is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we implement our business plan   as a result of the current difficult economic environment and our lack of funding to implement our business plan our board of directors has begun to analyze strategic alternatives available to our company to continue as a going concern such alternatives include raising additional debt or equity financing or consummating a merger or acquisition with a partner that may involve a change in our business plan   although our board of directors preference would be to obtain additional funding to implement our business plan the board believes that it must consider all viable strategic alternatives that are in the best interests of our shareholders such strategic alternatives include a merger acquisition share exchange asset purchase or similar transaction in which our present management will no longer be in control of our company and our business operations will be replaced by that of our transaction partner we believe we would be an attractive candidate for such a business combination due to the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered company thereby providing a transaction partner access to the public marketplace to raise capital   plan of operation   in order to begin executing on our business plan we must raise  in equity financing through a private placement in the current year we intend to concentrate the majority of our efforts on raising capital during this period   the table below sets forth the use of proceeds assuming that  of the securities offered for sale in the equity financing are sold management believes these costs will

we complete the financing our specific business plan for the next  months is as follows      table of contents     develop our website   we will procure a web designer to complete a corporate website and credit card payment processing services   initial marketing campaign   once our website is fully operational we intend to market our products aggressively through web print and other mediums   web marketing search engine optimization services will be used to assure that we are found using key words associated with wind energy ireland off the grid and more we intend to make our website a

liquidity and capital resources   as of july   and october   the company had cash of  and total assets of    as of july   the company had total liabilities of  compared with total liabilities of  as of october   the increase in total liabilities is due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as the company had limited cash flows to repay outstanding obligations as they became

public offering the offering as of october   the company issued  registered shares for a total of  in proceeds and the offering has been completed   in order to execute on our business strategy we will require additional working capital commensurate with the operational needs of our planned marketing and development efforts accordingly we expect to use debt andor equity financing to fund operations for the foreseeable future   we anticipate that we will incur the following expenses over the next twelve months       in connection with the development of our website and marketing efforts and           in operating expenses including professional legal and accounting expenses associated with our company being a reporting issuer under the securities exchange act of    we require

capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months we plan to complete private placement sales of our common stock in order to raise the funds necessary to pursue our plan of operation and to fund our working capital deficit in order to enable us to pay our accounts payable and accrued liabilities we currently do not have any arrangements in place for the completion of any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any private placement financings   any future sale of additional equity and debt securities will result in dilution to current stockholders we may also seek additional loans where the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require the company to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to expand business operations and could harm our overall business prospects   cash flows from operating activities   during the nine months ended july   the company used  of cash for operating activities compared with  for the nine months ended july   the decrease in the cash used for operating activities was attributed to the fact that the company paid less accounts payables that were coming due for outstanding operating activities   cash flows from financing activities   during the nine months ended july   the company received  from financing activities compared with  for the nine months ended july   the proceeds received from financing activities were financings provided by management to support the companys

analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q forwardlooking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations strategies financial results or other developments forwardlooking statements are based upon estimates forecasts and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control and many of which with respect to future business decisions are subject to change these uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf we disclaim any obligation to update forwardlooking statements overview we were incorporated under the name greenwind nrg inc in the state of nevada on february   we are a developmentstage company and we have no revenues and no assets as a result we have incurred losses since inception our limited operations to date have consisted of the formation of the company the raising of capital maintaining our public company reporting requirements on march   a registration statement on form s was declared effective for the registration of  shares of our common stock as of october   we had sold  shares pursuant to this registration statement and the offering has been completed our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months this is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we implement our business plan as a result of the current difficult economic environment and our lack of funding to implement our business plan our board of directors has begun to analyze strategic alternatives available to our company to continue as a going concern such alternatives include raising additional debt or equity financing or consummating a merger or acquisition with a partner that may involve a change in our business plan although our board of directors preference would be to obtain additional funding to implement our business plan the board believes that it must consider all viable strategic alternatives that are in the best interests of our shareholders such strategic alternatives include a merger acquisition share exchange asset purchase or similar transaction in which our present management will no longer be in control of our company and our business operations will be replaced by that of our transaction partner we believe we would be an attractive candidate for such a business combination due to the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered company thereby providing a transaction partner access to the public marketplace to raise capital plan of operation in order to begin executing on our business plan we must raise  in equity financing through a private placement in the current year we intend to concentrate the majority of our efforts on raising capital during this period the table below sets forth the use of proceeds assuming that  of the securities offered for sale in the equity financing are sold management believes these costs will cover the necessary expenses for the company to continue to develop our operations to the point that we may begin delivering services gross proceeds   offering expense   net proceeds   net proceeds to be used inventory   website development   marketing and advertising   audit accounting and filing fees   working capital   repayment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities     note the offering expense will be paid through the sale of equity or debt and not with the proceeds if any raised from this offering if we complete the financing our specific business plan for the next  months is as follows table of contents develop our website we will procure a web designer to complete a corporate website and credit card payment processing services initial marketing campaign once our website is fully operational we intend to market our products aggressively through web print and other mediums web marketing search engine optimization services will be used to assure that we are found using key words associated with wind energy ireland off the grid and more we intend to make our website a marketing piece in itself with maps showing wind speed locations in ireland and the uk as well as other information on the benefits of wind energy products print media advertising we intend to market our products in magazines and other print media that target an environmentally conscious consumer base we intend to spend up to  on marketing efforts the marketing budget is not a set cost but will be based on the amount raised in the financing results of operations for the period from february   date of inception to july   the company did not earn any revenues comparison of three months ended july   and  during the three months ended july   the company incurred  of operating expenses compared with  of operating expenses during the three months ended july   the decrease in operating expenses was attributed to a decrease in general and administrative costs the company incurred a net loss of  or  per share for the three months ended july   compared with a net loss of  or  per share for the three months ended july   comparison of nine months ended july   and  during the nine months ended july   the company incurred  of operating expenses compared with  of operating expenses during the nine months ended

october   the company had cash of  and total assets of  as of july   the company had total liabilities of  compared with total liabilities of  as of october   the increase in total liabilities is due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as the company had limited cash flows to repay outstanding obligations as they became due table of contents on march   a registration statement on form s was declared effective by the sec registering a total of  shares of our common stock the registered shares in an initial public offering the offering as of october   the company issued  registered shares for a total of  in proceeds and the offering has been completed in order to execute on our business strategy we will require additional working capital commensurate with the operational needs of our planned marketing and development efforts accordingly we expect to use debt andor equity financing to fund operations for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will incur the following expenses over the next twelve months   in connection with the development of our website and marketing efforts and   in operating expenses including professional legal and accounting expenses associated with our company being a reporting issuer under the securities exchange act of  we require a minimum of approximately  to proceed with our plan of operation over the next twelve months as we had cash and working capital in the amount of  as of july   we do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months we plan to complete private placement sales of our common stock in order to raise the funds necessary to pursue our plan of operation and to fund our working capital deficit in order to enable us to pay our accounts payable and accrued liabilities we currently do not have any arrangements in place for the completion of any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any private placement financings any future sale of additional equity and debt securities will result in dilution to current stockholders we may also seek additional loans where the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require the company to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to expand business operations and could harm our overall business prospects cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended july   the company used  of cash for operating activities compared with  for the nine months ended july   the decrease in the cash used for operating activities was attributed to the fact that the company paid less accounts payables that were coming due for

condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q  forwardlooking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations strategies financial results or other developments  forwardlooking statements are based upon estimates forecasts and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control and many of which with respect to future business decisions are subject to change  these uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf  we disclaim any obligation to update forwardlooking statements overview   we were incorporated under the name greenwind nrg inc in the state of nevada on february   we are a developmentstage company and we have no revenues and no assets as a result we have incurred losses since inception  our limited operations to date have consisted of the formation of the company the raising of capital maintaining our public company reporting requirements   on march   a registration statement on form s was declared effective for the registration of  shares of our common stock  as of october   we had sold  shares pursuant to this registration statement and the offering has been completed our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months this is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we implement our business plan as a result of the current difficult economic environment and our lack of funding to implement our business plan our board of directors has begun to analyze strategic alternatives available to our company to continue as a going concern such alternatives include raising additional debt or equity financing or consummating a merger or acquisition with a partner that may involve a change in our business plan   although our board of directors’ preference would be to obtain additional funding to implement our business plan the board believes that it must consider all viable strategic alternatives that are in the best interests of our shareholders such strategic alternatives include a merger acquisition share exchange asset purchase or similar transaction in which our present management will no longer be in control of our company and our business operations will be replaced by that of our transaction partner we believe we would be an attractive candidate for such a business combination due to the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered company thereby providing a transaction partner access to the public marketplace to raise capital plan of operation in order to begin executing on our business plan we must raise  in equity financing through a private placement in the current year  we intend to concentrate the majority of our efforts on raising capital during this period the table below sets forth the use of proceeds assuming that  of the securities offered for sale in the equity financing are sold management believes these costs will cover the necessary expenses for the company to continue to develop our operations to the point that we may begin delivering services gross proceeds

print media advertising we intend to market our products in magazines and other print media that target an environmentally conscious consumer base we intend to spend up to  on marketing efforts the marketing budget is not a set cost but will be based on the amount raised in the financing results of operations for the period from february   date of inception to april   the company did not earn any revenues comparison of three months ended april   and  during the three months ended april   the company incurred  of operating expenses compared with  of operating expenses during the three

accrued liabilities we currently do not have any arrangements in place for the completion of any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any private placement financings   any future sale of additional equity and debt securities will result in dilution to current stockholders we may also seek additional loans where the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require the company to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to expand business operations and could harm our overall business prospects   cash flows from operating activities during the six months ended april   the company used  of cash for operating activities compared with  for the six
