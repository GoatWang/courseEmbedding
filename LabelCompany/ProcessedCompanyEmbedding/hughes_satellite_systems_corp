equipment has to be returned hughesnet will send instructions on how to deinstall equipment but a thirdparty technician may do it for a fee determined by the technician the most notable difference in performance between a hughesnets gen broadband service and most cable and dsl internet services is the latency issue also referred to as high ping times the gen ping times average ms to ms as compared to ms to ms from cable dsl and fiber services for example comcast xfinity ping measured on average ms and verizon fios was ms the reason for this is that data must travel approximately  miles with satellite internet — from dish to satellite and back again this creates a fraction of a second delay in internet responsiveness while browsing for a website or downloading content this delay goes unnoticed but during realtime multiplayer games this delay creates game latency high ping and an unreliable connection with the gaming server many game servers will autokick players who have a high ping as it creates “lag” and disrupts gameplay for others in some situations realtime multiplayer game play is possible but this is the exception also voip services eg skype google talk suffer from the high ping times however they generally tolerate the ping delays better than realtime multiplayer game play does twoway low quality video calls can be performed hughesnet gen is the latest generation of satellite internet service from hughes network systems at its launch on march   hughesnet gen became the first satellite internet service to offer fccdefined broadband speeds from

the brand under which hughes network systems provides its oneway and twoway satellite internet access technology and service in united states and europe hughesnet provides satellite internet access cross the contiguous united states in areas with a clear view of their satellites from the united states these satellites are located in the southern sky originally branded as direcpc and later direcway it originally marketed to business customers as a side venture to the consumer product directv in october  operating as an independent entity hughes communications expanded into the consumer market primarily targeting workathome consumers who might otherwise use isdn it officially changed its name on march   hughesnet services are sold directly throughout north america and in brazil europe and india from authorized service providers and resellers hughesnet gen service offers customers twoway satellite internet downstream speeds of up to  mbits mbits and upload speeds of up to  mbits however it is common to see download speeds of  mbits data allowances are split between two time slots during a hour period the anytime data allowance time slot is from  am to  am and the bonus bytes data allowance time slot is from  am –  am in  the fcc ranked hughesnet  in the nation among all internet providers for providing speeds that they advertise even during peak times depending on the customers service plan anytime data allowances are gb to gb per month all plans have  gb per month of bonus bytes data allowance hughesnet pricing plans also include monthly data allowances which when reached or exceeded will result in data transfer speed reductions to speeds of  kbits until the next billing cycle actual costs andor data plans and monthly limits may change and are updated on their website hughesnet has a month contract period there are high cancellation fees if the contract is ended early at the end of service the equipment has to be returned hughesnet will send instructions on how to deinstall equipment but a thirdparty technician may do it for a fee determined by the technician the most notable difference in performance between a hughesnets gen broadband service and most cable and dsl internet services is the latency issue also referred to as high ping times the gen ping times average ms to ms as compared to ms to ms from cable dsl and fiber services for example comcast xfinity ping measured on average ms and verizon fios was ms the reason for this is that data must travel approximately  miles with satellite internet — from dish to satellite and back again this creates a fraction of a second delay in internet responsiveness while browsing for a website or downloading content this delay goes unnoticed but during realtime multiplayer games this delay creates game latency high ping and an unreliable connection with the gaming server many game servers will autokick players who have a high ping as it creates “lag” and disrupts gameplay for others in some situations realtime multiplayer game play is possible but this is the exception also voip services eg skype google talk suffer from the high ping times however they generally tolerate the ping delays better than realtime multiplayer game play does twoway low quality video calls can be performed hughesnet gen is the latest generation of satellite internet service from hughes network systems at its launch on march   hughesnet gen became the first satellite internet service to offer fccdefined broadband speeds from coasttocoast hughesnet gen delivers download speeds of  mbps and
