director stephen kessler sets out to profile the prolific singersongwriteractor who seemed ubiquitous in the s and s only to disappear from the spotlight following a protracted battle with drugs and alcohol convinced that the onceprolific paul williams has passed away as he scours the internet to purchase one of his albums kessler discovers to his surprise that not only is williams alive and well but hes also still performing regularly to adoring fans around the world like many teens of the s and s kessler connected with williams pensive poetic songs about love and loneliness and upon learning that he would be performing at a winnipeg screening of phantom of the paradise panned by critics the notorious brian de palma bomb was a massive hit in just two cities winnipeg and paris the filmmaker convinces williams to be profiled in a documentary at first williams is somewhat aloof yet kessler persists and in time makes a breakthrough by bonding with the performer over his favorite seafood meanwhile as kessler begins exploring the highs and lows of williams career the subject pulls the storyteller into the film and a close friendship begins to develop later kessler tags along with williams for a concert in the philippines where their bond is cemented during a tense bus ride through the mindanao jungle as a result the filmmaker gets the one thing hes craved since one of his earliest meetings with williams though when it seems to go awry he fears that he may have betrayed his new friends trust  rovi read more disc   paul williams still alive  i always thought he died too
