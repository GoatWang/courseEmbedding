molding technology and why is it better positive molding technology is a key performanceenhancing feature of monroe® premium brake pads this presscuring process the same used by leading oe manufacturers guarantees that full frictionmaterial density is reached on every part most aftermarket competitors utilize the flash mold process requiring high resin content to make the friction material flow high resin creates fade which can increase stopping distances up to  back to top what are the differences between the ceramics and dynamics formulations to maintain the braking performance of any vehicle its generally recommended to follow the oe manufacturers choice of friction material replacing semimetallic with semimetallic organic with organic etc there are however options for improving braking performance thats why monroe® offers choices to assist in making the best selection for each vehicle monroe ceramics® brake pads feature a nonferrous formulation to

for most applications back to top do monroe brakes® include noise elimination clips total solution™ pads shims clips and lubrication are packaged together in a single box to ensure you have all of the parts you need for a perfect repair for most applications back to top how do monroe® pads help reduce brake fade monroes positive molding technology oespecified constant pressure molding process for bonding the pad to the backing plate reduces resin content by resulting in more active ingredient in the friction material this denser material performs better lasts longer produces less dust and is quieter back to top how are the monroe® backing plates better the monroe® pads qlock textured backing plate holds friction material better than conventional stampedsteel for less pad separation less vibration and less noise back to top what is the noise reduction system this includes the abutment hardwareclips and molybased silicone lubricant included with each set of monroe® brake pads to ensure satisfaction back to top why is integrally molded better than riveted backing plates integrally molded or molded directly to the backing plate results in much more strength and less flex than the riveting process back to top why should the brake rotors be washed when installing new pads the quality of todays drums and rotors requires removal of any and all dust particles andor residues residual contaminants may be present from reconditioning or shipping monroe® recommends removing contaminants with detergent warm water and a clean cloth caution shop towels are chemically treated and may leave a residue that will result in glazing back to top what should i use to wash brake rotors monroe® recommends removing contaminants with detergent warm water and a clean cloth caution shop towels are chemically treated and may leave a residue that will result in glazing back to top should i turn my new rotors prior to installation the cnc lathe used during rotor manufacturing creates a surface roughness ra that meets or exceeds the oe standard it is difficult to obtain this ra when reconditioning or turning new rotors so monroe® does not recommend turning new rotors back to top can i use semi metallic pads on a vehicle that originally came with ceramic pads to maintain the braking performance of any vehicle the generally accepted recommendation is to follow the manufacturers

choices to assist in making the best selection to meet vehicle braking requirements back to top i recently had new brakes installed on my vehicle and now experience pedal pulsations why pedal pulsation may occur when rotors or drums have been overheated or incorrectly machined rotor run out and thickness variations are often the result of incorrect torquing of wheel lug nuts back to top i recently had new brakes installed on my vehicle and now experience a pull why disc brakes do not have return springs a sticky piston or dirty or rusty sliding surface may prevent the pads from sufficiently releasing allowing them to drag on the rotor brake pull may also be caused by worn a wheel bearing suspension components or tires of unequal sizes generating different levels of leverage back to top i recently had new brakes installed on my vehicle and now experience a soft pedal why a soft pedal could indicate an internal master cylinder leaking air in system or drum brakes out of adjustment back to top how often should a brake lath be indexed refer to manufacturers manual for service and calibration or indexing schedule back to top what should i use to clean the surface of the brake pads as a rule nothing should ever be applied to the surface of the brake pad in the event that the surface becomes contaminated clean with detergent and warm water brake clean may be used to remove heavy soiling but must be followed with detergent and warm water back to top what causes my wheels to be constantly covered with brake dust as the friction material wears the brake lining material becomes airborne the rotation of the wheel assembly causes a magnetic field that may attract ferrous metals from the lining material monroe ceramics® are a genuine ceramic formulation with virtually no ferrous metal content and monroe® dymanics are formulated to have the least ferrous metal content of any semimetallic friction material available back to top are monroe® pads chamfered

runs cooler holes and slots also expel water for optimal pad contact in the rain and they vent gasses from the brake pads to reduce brake fade and increase pad life we offer rotors in standard and larger than stock sizes in onepiece design and twopiece with lightweight aluminum center construction most have curved and directional internal vanes to maximize airflow for cooling our brake pads come in a myriad of organic ceramic and metallic compounds so you can get the friction material that’s ideally suited to your needswe offer both direct replacement calipers and for the ultimate in performance fixed calipers with multiple opposed pistons on each side of the brake disc both are made from lightweight aluminum fixed calipers transfer pressure to the brake pads more efficiently than the typical oe floating calipers and multiple pistons apply more even pressure to the pads performance calipers often have larger pistons which can provide more clamping pressure many calipers with  or more pistons have bore sizes that increase in size from front to rear to keep the brake pad flat against the rotor and prevent pad taperone of the easiest upgrades you can make to your brake system is replacing the stock rubber brake hoses with stainless steel stainless steel brake hoses have a teflon inner hose with a braided stainless steel covering this construction prevents expansion when the hose is pressurized eliminating the mushy pedal feel that you can experience with ordinary rubber hoses especially when the brake fluid temperature is elevated under performance driving conditions the stainless steel also provides better protection against debris and abrasion and provides a much better appearance as well when building a race car and using calipers with different piston bores the master cylinder bore diameter may also need to be changed to maintain proper pedal travel space is often at a premium on racing vehicles and the master cylinder may have to be smaller in size or mounted in a different location we offer a large selection of master cylinders so you can get the one that’s best for your application including tandem master cylinders compact remote flange mount master cylinders high volume master cylinders and master cylinders designed for remote reservoirsdisc brakes are the gold standard of braking but if your vehicle is afflicted with drum brakes our drumtodisc brake conversion kits are the performance remedy their ineffective drum brakes were the weakness of classic muscle cars but with our conversion kits you can upgrade to disc brakes and enjoy stopping power that matches the go power we offer everything from basic kits with front spindles backing plates and caliper brackets that allow you to build your own system to complete front and wheel kits that include the above plus calipers rotors bearings hoses master cylinder and booster we also have rear disc brake conversion kits to upgrade many late model pickups to wheel disc brakes brake fluid is one of the most important components of a high performance brake system ordinary dot  fluid does not have a high enough boiling point for performance use and even lesser grades of dot  fluid can be too hygroscopic and attract moisture which lowers the boiling point the high performance fluid we offer has been tested to °f it has low moisture affinity and resists aeration and compressibility to maintain firm pedal feel we also offer dot  silicone fluid for classic and show cars which won’t harm paint if spilled dot  should not be used for racingfeatured videospower stop z

their ferocity under the hood drums at all  wheels made classic muscle cars weaklings in the brake department their neck snapping acceleration is legendary but getting them hauled down from speed in enough time could be just as hair raising unequal shoetodrum clearance caused by dodgy selfadjusters could result in pull and an unexpected lane change in a panic stop and repeated use such as would be experienced driving on curvy roads and mountainous terrain would result in brake fade and even worse performance although disc brakes at the front are a vast improvement over wheel drum brakes you can do better front discsrear drums were original equipment on millions of cars and trucks and many are still produced with this brake arrangement today but rear drums can suffer the same fading from aggressive driving or hauling heavy loads or towing resulting in extended stopping distances rear drum brake selfadjusters are just as problematic and you can end up with a low pedal when they fail or don’t work properly and drum brakes are much more time consuming and tedious to service in addition to brake shoes they often require brake hardware replacement due to the extreme heat buildup that occurs inside the brake drum our disc brake conversion kits are the remedy for ineffective and troublesome drum brakes disc brakes naturally run cooler because their friction surface is exposed to the air unlike the enclosed friction surface on drum brakes cooling is further improved on vented rotors that have cooling fins cast in between the friction surfaces this ability to dissipate heat virtually eliminates the high brake temperatures that can cause brake fade disc brakes are also inherently selfadjusting and because the clearance between brake pads and rotors is consistent you get better pedal feel and more predictable braking with its exposed components a disc brake system is also much easier to inspect and service than a drum brake system we offer kits to replace the front drum brakes on most popular classic and muscle cars as well as wheel conversion kits and kits that convert the rear drum brakes to discs on many late model cars trucks and suvs each kit is designed for the specific application and a bolton installation without the need for any fabrication rear conversions retain parking brake functionality via caliper activated or internal expanding shoe parking brakes and if your budget only allows a front disc brake conversion right now we offer rear only conversion kits for wheel drum brake vehicles so you can complete the conversion to wheel disc brakes in the future with our selection of kits you can do more than just convert to disc brakes you can also upgrade your brake system to beyond oe level performance choose from basic kits that include spindles backing plates and caliper brackets allowing you to build your own conversion kit to wheel kits that in addition to the above include rotors calipers hoses and bearings to complete kits that add a master cylinder and booster these components will be a marked improvement over drum brakes but if you want more we have kits that feature multipiston calipers drilled and slotted rotors and braided steel lines with rotor sizes that will fit inside standard wheels to sizes that require an increase in wheel diameter related categories brake kitshigh performance  racing kitsbrake padsbrake

performanceheatshieldbig end performancesurrwhen you’re driving at speed things happen fast and you need brakes that will instantly respond to avoid a crash hydraulic pressure that’s wasted expanding rubber brake hoses instead of doing the more important work of applying caliper pistons and brake pads will result in longer stopping distances this condition gets even worse when original equipment fabric reinforced rubber hoses get soft and swell with age our performance brake hoses are constructed from ptfe teflon® tubing covered by woven stainless steel braid they’ve been tested at pressures far greater than the average master cylinder can exert so you can be assured that all the hydraulic pressure your brake system develops will go to apply the caliper pistons and nothing else braided steel hoses are also much tougher than their rubber counterparts and better able to resist impacts and abrasions so they’re perfect for severe duty conditions like offroading and braided steel hoses have the hightech highperformance look that will set off your machine it’s easy to get this performance durability and appearance upgrade no matter what you drive we have application specific kits for most cars truck and suvs these hoses are the proper length and have the right fittings to connect right into your system without the need for any fabrication but if you’re building a custom or race car with other than stock brake and suspension components we also offer universal and competition hoses in a range of lengths with straight banjo and  degree steel fittings or if you want to construct your own hoses we have bulk hose ready to cut to size and hose ends for assembly another common reason for upgrading from original brake hoses is when they’re not long enough to work with suspension modifications this is especially common on lifted trucks you can order individual hoses in longer lengths but we’ve made it much easier by offering application specific hoses and kits designed to work with particular lift heights these hoses come ready to connect into your oe brake system but with the longer length you need to accommodate increased suspension travel in addition to the above we also have a large selection of clamps brackets hardware and proportioning valves to complete the jobrelated categories brake kitshigh performance  racing kitsbrake padsbrake pads pad sets pad shimsbrake

runs cooler holes and slots also expel water for optimal pad contact in the rain and they vent gasses from the brake pads to reduce brake fade and increase pad life we offer rotors in standard and larger than stock sizes in onepiece design and twopiece with lightweight aluminum center construction most have curved and directional internal vanes to maximize airflow for cooling our brake pads come in a myriad of organic ceramic and metallic compounds so you can get the friction material that’s ideally suited to your needswe offer both direct replacement calipers and for the ultimate in performance fixed calipers with multiple opposed pistons on each side of the brake disc both are made from lightweight aluminum fixed calipers transfer pressure to the brake pads more efficiently than the typical oe floating calipers and multiple pistons apply more even pressure to the pads performance calipers often have larger pistons which can provide more clamping pressure many calipers with  or more pistons have bore sizes that increase in size from front to rear to keep the brake pad flat against the rotor and prevent pad taperone of the easiest upgrades you can make to your brake system is replacing the stock rubber brake hoses with stainless steel stainless steel brake hoses have a teflon inner hose with a braided stainless steel covering this construction prevents expansion when the hose is pressurized eliminating the mushy pedal feel that you can experience with ordinary rubber hoses especially when the brake fluid temperature is elevated under performance driving conditions the stainless steel also provides better protection against debris and abrasion and provides a much better appearance as well when building a race car and using calipers with different piston bores the master cylinder bore diameter may also need to be changed to maintain proper pedal travel space is often at a premium on racing vehicles and the master cylinder may have to be smaller in size or mounted in a different location we offer a large selection of master cylinders so you can get the one that’s best for your application including tandem master cylinders compact remote flange mount master cylinders high volume master cylinders and master cylinders designed for remote reservoirsdisc brakes are the gold standard of braking but if your vehicle is afflicted with drum brakes our drumtodisc brake conversion kits are the performance remedy their ineffective drum brakes were the weakness of classic muscle cars but with our conversion kits you can upgrade to disc brakes and enjoy stopping power that matches the go power we offer everything from basic kits with front spindles backing plates and caliper brackets that allow you to build your own system to complete front and wheel kits that include the above plus calipers rotors bearings hoses master cylinder and booster we also have rear disc brake conversion kits to upgrade many late model pickups to wheel disc brakes brake fluid is one of the most important components of a high performance brake system ordinary dot  fluid does not have a high enough boiling point for performance use and even lesser grades of dot  fluid can be too hygroscopic and attract moisture which lowers the boiling point the high performance fluid we offer has been tested to °f it has low moisture affinity and resists aeration and compressibility to maintain firm pedal feel we also offer dot  silicone fluid for classic and show cars which won’t harm paint if spilled dot  should not be used for racingfeatured videospower stop z
