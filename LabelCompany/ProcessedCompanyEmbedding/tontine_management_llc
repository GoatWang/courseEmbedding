south dakota tennessee texas utah vermont virginia washington west virginia wisconsin wyoming   zip code   what is an llc like a corporation a limited liability company or llc is a separate and distinct legal entity  this means that an llc can have its own tax identification number and bank account  the primary advantage of an llc is that its owners have limited liability meaning that under most circumstances the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the llc  for example if an llc is forced into bankruptcy the owners will not be required to pay the llcs debts with their own money  if the assets of the llc are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities the creditors generally cannot look to the owners managers or officers for relief an llc can be taxed either as a passthrough entity like a sole proprietorship or partnership or as a regular corporation  by default an llc is taxed as a passthrough entity where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the llc at their individual tax rates  this is different from a regular c corporation which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders the owners as dividends  when the corporation distributes profits the stockholders also must pay income tax on these dividends  most llc owners choose to have the profits passthrough so that taxes are only paid once on the profits totallegal™ has helped over  million people nationwide make essential personal and business legal documents themselves   pro se planning inc all rights reserved home  terms of use
