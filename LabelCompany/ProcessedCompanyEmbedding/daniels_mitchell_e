interest congress repealed the thimerosal provision following expressions of public displeasure shortly after the invasion of afghanistan daniels gave a speech to the national press club in which he challenged the view of those who wanted to continue typical spending while the nation was at war “the idea of reallocating assets from less important to more important things especially in a time of genuine emergency makes common sense and is applied everywhere else in life” he said conservative columnist ross douthat stated in a column about daniels time at omb that daniels carried water as director of the office of management and budget for some of the bush administration’s more egregious budgets but douthat while calling daniels “america’s best governor” defended daniels against accusations that daniels inaccurately assessed the costs of the iraq war in the final days of  when an invasion of iraq was still a hypothetical question daniels told the new york times that the cost of war with iraq “could be” in the range of  to  billion it was not clear whether daniels was referring to the cost of a short invasion or a longer war but he did indicate the administration was budgeting for both he also described the “backoftheenvelope” estimate by bush economic advisor lawrence b lindsey that it would cost  to  billion as much too high two days later after the new years holiday an omb spokesperson clarified daniels’ remarks adding that the  to  billion figure was not a hard white house estimate and “it is impossible to know what any military campaign would ultimately cost the only cost estimate we know of in this arena is the persian gulf war and that was a  billion event three months later on march   five days after the start of the invasion president bush requested  billion through an emergency supplemental appropriation to cover operational expenses in iraq until september  of that year according to the congressional budget office military operations in iraq for  cost  billion less than the amount projected by daniels and omb douthat and other daniel’s defenders accuse daniels critics of mischaracterizing the sixmonth supplemental appropriation as a request to fund the entire war between september  and october  lawmakers appropriated about  trillion for operations in both the war in iraq and afghanistan governoredit election campaignedit main

sixteen years or so it had been  years since indiana had had a republican governor his opponent in the general election was the incumbent joe kernan who had succeeded to the office upon the death of frank obannon campaign ads by kernan and the democratic party attempted to tie daniels to number of issues—his jail time for marijuana use a stock sale leading to speculations of insider trading and

and he did not indicate whether he would sign or veto the law until after it passed the general assembly daniels signed the bill on may   planned parenthood and the aclu subsequently brought a lawsuit against the state alleging it was being targeted unfairly that the state law violated federal medicaid laws and that their fourteenth amendment rights were violated a may  ruling allowing the case to move forward but denied the request from the petitioners to grant a temporary injunction to restore the funding however a june  ruling prohibited the state from enforcing the law immigrationedit on may  daniels signed into law two immigration bills one denying instate tuition prices to illegal immigrants and another creating fines for employers that employed illegal immigrants several protestors at least five of whom were illegal immigrants were arrested while protesting the law at the statehouse when they broke into daniels office after being denied a meeting student leaders called for their release while some state legislators called for their deportation state democratic party leaders accused daniels and the republicans of passing controversial legislation only to enhance daniels image so he could seek the presidency daniels however denied the charges saying he would have enacted the same agenda years earlier had the thendemocratic majority permitted him to do so budget cutsedit the state forecast continued revenue declines in  that would result in a  billion budget shortfall if the state budget grew at its normal rate daniels submitted a twoyear  billion spending plan to the general assembly which would result in a  million surplus that would be used to rebuild the state reserve funds to  billion he proposed a wide range of budget austerity measures including employee furloughing spending reductions freezing state hiring freezing state employee wages and a host of administrative changes for state agencies the state had already been gradually reducing its workforce by similar freezes and by  indiana had the fewest state employees per capita than any other state—a figure daniels touted to say indiana had the nations smallest government daniels backed the creation of additional toll roads expanding on his  overhaul of the indiana toll road system known as major moves in an attempt to secure an additional source of revenue for the state but opposition from within his own party led to the bill being withdrawn by its republican sponsor sen tom wyss which resulted in danielss only significant legislative defeat during the  session the legislative walkouts delayed progress on the budget passage for nearly two months but the house of representatives was able to begin working on it in committee in april the body made several alterations to the bill including a reapportionment of education funding based more heavily on the number of students at a school and removing some public school funding to finance the new voucher system and charter schools energyedit daniels announced in october  that a substitute natural gas company intended to build a facility in southern indiana that would produce pipeline quality substitute natural gas sng the lead investor was leucadia national which proposed a  billion plant in rockport indiana under the terms of the deal endorsed by daniels the state would buy almost all the rockport gas and resell it on the open market throughout the country if the plant made money from the sale excess profits would be split between leucadia nationals indiana subsidiary indiana gassification and the state if it lost money from the sale then  of the losses would be passed onto indiana consumers leucadia agreed to reimburse the state for any losses up to  million over  years gas from the plant would make up about  percent of the states supply critics feared that if gas prices fell over the next  years the costs of the lost profits would be passed onto the bills of residents once the  million guarantee by leucadia was used up the deal also received criticism due to government intrusion in the energy markets questions were also raised due to leucadia national hiring mark lubbers to promote the deal lubbers is a former aide and close friend of daniels the daniels administration maintained that the plant would create jobs in an economically depressed part of the state and offer environmental benefits through an instate energy source the project was ultimately panned by the state legislature in  right to workedit indiana became the first state in a decade to adopt right to work legislation indiana is home to many manufacturing jobs the indiana economic development corp has reported that  firms said the new law was an important factor in deciding to move to indiana gov daniels signed the legislation on feb   without much fanfare in the hopes of dispersing labor protesters before the super bowl in indianapolis  presidential speculationedit although daniels had claimed to be reluctant to seek higher office many media outlets including politico the weekly standard forbes the washington post cnn the economist and the indianapolis star began to speculate that daniels may intend to seek the republican nomination for president in  after he joined the national debate on cap and trade legislation by penning a response in the wall street journal to policies espoused by the democraticmajority congress and the white house in august  the speculation has included daniels record of reforming government reducing taxes balancing the budget and connecting with voters in indiana despite his signing into law of bills that toughened drug enforcement regulated abortion and a defense of marriage act he has angered some conservatives because of his call for a truce on social issues so the party can focus on fiscal issuescitation needed his willingness to consider tax increases to rectify a budget deficit has been another source of contention in august  the economist praised daniels reverence for restraint and efficacy and concluded that he is in short just the kind of man to relish fixing a broken state—or country nick gillespie of reason called daniels a smart and effective leader who is a serious thinker about history politics and policy and wrote that daniels like former new mexico gov gary johnson is a republican who knows how to govern and can do it well in february  david brooks of the new york times described daniels as the partys strongest would be candidate predicting that he couldnt match obama in grace and elegance but he could on substance on december   daniels suggested in a local interview that he would decide on a white house run before may  different groups and individuals pressured daniels to run for office in response to early speculation daniels dismissed a presidential run in june  saying ive only ever run for or held one office its the last one im going to hold however in february  he told a washington post reporter that he was open to the idea of running in  on march   daniels was the winner of an oregon republican party straw poll daniels drew  of the vote besting second place finisher mitt romney  and third place finisher sarah palin  and was the winner of a similar straw poll in the state of washington on may   daniels told an interviewer that he would announce within weeks his decision of whether or not to run for the republican presidential nomination he said he felt he was not prepared to debate on all the national issues like foreign policy and needed time to better understand the issues and put together formal positions later in may as the republican field began to resolve with announcements and withdrawals of other candidates time said even setting aside his somewhat unusual family situation daniels would need to hurry to put together an organization and raise enough money if he intended to run daniels announced he would not seek the republican nomination for the presidency on the night of may   via an email to the press citing family constraints and the loss of privacy the family would experience should he become a candidate  presidential speculationedit in january  the republican national committee sent an email to subscribers asking them to pick their top three presidential choices the poll included thirty two potential candidates including daniels in march  fortune magazine named daniels no  on its list of the worlds  greatest leaders generating a new round of calls for daniels to consider his options in  daniels was the only american university president and the only national political figure excluding detroit mayor mike duggan to make the global list purdue universityedit purdue university president mitch daniels talks with agriculture secretary tom vilsack in  selectionedit the purdue university board of trustees unanimously elected mitch daniels president of purdue university on june   as governor daniels had appointed  of the  board members and had reappointed the other two which critics claimed was a conflict of interest a state investigation released in october  found that the circumstances did not violate the indiana code of ethics other critics of his selection pointed out that unlike previous purdue presidents he lacked a background in academia his term as president began upon completion of his term as governor in january  in preparation for his term as president of purdue university daniels stopped participating in partisan political activity during the  election cycle and focused instead on issues related to higher education and fiscal matters in order to avoid the financial cost of a formal inauguration daniels instead wrote an open letter to the people of purdue in which he documented the challenges facing higher education and outlined his initial priorities such as affordability academic excellence and academic freedom daniels has continued this practice opting to send open letters to the purdue community instead of giving a formal state of the university speech as is more common in higher education student interactionsedit daniels works out daily at the student gym and eats frequently with students in student dining facilities in march  he joined forces with a group of engineering students to create a viral music video promoting engineering and purdue university within  hours the video had received over  views purdue home football games feature a segment entitled wheres mitch in which the stadium video board shows the camera panning the crowd and eventually finding daniels sitting among the fans sometimes in the student section former purdue presidents rarely left their suite in the pressbox structure tuition freezes and cost reductionsedit the total cost of attending purdue has fallen since daniels assumed purdue’s presidency despite a trend at big ten institutions of rising costs total loan debt among the student body has also fallen  or  million tuition at purdue prior to daniels’ arrival had increased every year since  two months after daniels assumed his role as president purdue announced it would freeze tuition for two years eventually extending the freeze for six years through  as a result multiple graduating classes have become the first in at least  years to leave purdue having never experienced a tuition increase instate tuition is more than  lower than if the university had raised rates at the national average and students and families have saved more than  million in educational expenses daniels announced the first tuition freeze before the state had determined purdues funding for the next biennium amidst questions about the timing daniels argued that he didnt need to wait because it doesnt matter what the general assembly does this is the right thing to do and we are going to do itthe same way families do the same way some governments do and all businesses do we are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue i know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend and i just think weve reached the point where we ought to break that pattern the first tuition freeze required the university to find  million in savings or new revenue in order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes daniels and the purdue board of trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers investing cash reserves and switching to a consumerdriven health plan for employees daniels also reduced meal plan rates for students by  percent froze housing costs and cut the universitys cooperative education fees which had increased every year prior on record in fall  daniels announced a deal with amazon to save students on textbooks and provide students faculty and staff with free one day shipping to locations on campus daniels has stated that the amazon partnership saves students more than  a semester and has provided purdue with  in new scholarship funds agendaedit in september  daniels announced the major priorities of his administration known as purdue moves the plan continued daniels’ focus on affordability but also called for new investments such as the hiring of  new faculty in stem disciplines expansion of flipped classrooms growing summer enrollment investments in plant science and drug discovery research and the creation of competencybased degree programs and some year degree options the purdue moves also emphasized commercialization of research under daniels leadership purdue increased the number of affiliated startup companies by more than  percent and broke the university record for patents in  daniels announced plans to start the purdue polytechnic indianapolis high school designed to be a bridge for innercity students to purdue by admitting graduates directly to purdue daniels described the high school as an attempt to increase the number of lowincome firstgeneration and minority students who are prepared for purdue the high school will not open until  but purdue reported record levels of minority and underrepresented students in the fall  semester daniels also has emphasized free speech and inquiry by becoming the first public institution to adopt the chicago principles for free speech and inquiry and one of roughly two dozen universities to receive the highest rating from the foundation for individual rights in education in  daniels and the purdue board of trustees announced its intention to acquire kaplan university for the purpose of transforming it into an online purdue program compensationedit when daniels was hired by purdue he requested that his salary be less than his predecessors maximum salary and that  percent of his take home be based on the results of biannual performance reviews daniel’s base salary of  is  less than the prior president’s salary under the contract his salary can grow to a maximum of  based on the results of a performancebonus system—still less than his predecessor and the rd lowest in the member big ten in november  daniels earned  percent of his at risk pay receiving the grade of a b from the trustees board serviceedit in february  daniels was asked to cochair a national research council committee to review and make

daniels carried water as director of the office of management and budget for some of the bush administration’s more egregious budgets but douthat while calling daniels “america’s best governor”

after the new years holiday an omb spokesperson clarified daniels’ remarks adding that the  to  billion figure was not a hard white house estimate and “it is impossible to know what any military

election cycle and focused instead on issues related to higher education and fiscal matters in order to avoid the financial cost of a formal inauguration daniels instead wrote an open letter to the people of purdue in which he documented the challenges facing higher education and outlined his initial priorities such as affordability academic excellence and academic freedom daniels has continued this practice opting to send open letters to the purdue community instead of giving a formal state of the university speech as is more common in higher education student interactionsedit daniels works out daily at the student gym and eats frequently with students in student dining facilities in march  he joined forces with a group of engineering students to create a viral music video promoting engineering and purdue university within  hours the video had received over  views purdue home football games feature a segment entitled wheres mitch in which the stadium video board shows the camera panning the crowd and eventually finding daniels sitting among the fans sometimes in the student section former purdue presidents rarely left their suite in the pressbox structure tuition freezes and cost reductionsedit the total cost of attending purdue has fallen since daniels assumed purdue’s presidency despite a trend at big ten institutions of rising costs total loan debt among the student body has also fallen  or  million tuition at purdue prior to daniels’ arrival had increased every year since  two months after daniels assumed his role as president purdue announced it would freeze tuition for two years eventually extending the freeze for six years through  as a result multiple graduating classes have become the first in at least  years to leave purdue having never experienced a tuition increase instate tuition is more than  lower than if the university had raised rates at the national average and students and families have saved more than  million in educational expenses daniels announced the first tuition freeze before the state had determined purdues funding for the next biennium amidst questions about the timing daniels argued that he didnt need to wait because it doesnt matter what the general assembly does this is the right thing to do and we are going to do itthe same way families do the same way some governments do and all businesses do we are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue i know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend and i just think weve reached the point where we ought to break that pattern the first tuition freeze required the university to find  million in savings or new revenue in order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes daniels and the purdue board of trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers investing cash reserves and switching to a consumerdriven health plan for employees daniels also reduced meal plan rates for students by  percent froze housing costs and cut the universitys cooperative education fees which had increased every year prior on record in fall  daniels announced a deal with amazon to save students on textbooks and provide students faculty and staff with free one day shipping to locations on campus daniels has stated that the amazon partnership saves students more than  a semester and has provided purdue with  in new scholarship funds agendaedit in september  daniels announced the major priorities of his administration known as purdue moves the plan continued daniels’ focus on affordability but also called for new investments such as the hiring of  new faculty in stem disciplines expansion of flipped classrooms growing summer enrollment investments in plant science and drug discovery research and the creation of competencybased degree programs and some year degree options the purdue moves also emphasized commercialization of research under daniels leadership purdue increased the number of affiliated startup companies by more than  percent and broke the university record for patents in  daniels announced plans to start the purdue polytechnic indianapolis high school designed to be a bridge for innercity students to purdue by admitting graduates directly to purdue daniels described the high school as an attempt to increase the number of lowincome firstgeneration and minority students who are prepared for purdue the high school will not open until  but purdue reported record levels of minority and underrepresented students in the fall  semester daniels also has emphasized free speech and inquiry by becoming the first public institution to adopt the chicago principles for free speech and inquiry and one of roughly two dozen universities to receive the highest rating from the foundation for individual rights in education in  daniels and the purdue board of trustees announced its intention to acquire kaplan university for the purpose of transforming it into an online purdue program compensationedit when daniels was hired by purdue he requested that his salary be less than his predecessors maximum salary and that  percent of his take home be based on the results of biannual performance reviews daniel’s base salary of  is  less than the prior president’s salary under the contract his salary can grow to a maximum of  based on the results of a performancebonus system—still less than his predecessor and the rd lowest in the member big ten in november  daniels earned  percent of his at risk pay receiving the grade of a b from the trustees board serviceedit in february  daniels was

still a hypothetical question daniels told the new york times that the cost of war with iraq “could be” in the range of  to  billion it was not clear whether daniels was referring to the cost of a short invasion or a longer war but he did indicate the administration was budgeting for both he also described the “backoftheenvelope” estimate by bush economic advisor lawrence b lindsey that it would cost  to  billion as much too high two days later after the new years holiday an omb spokesperson clarified daniels’ remarks adding that the  to  billion figure was not a hard white house estimate and “it is impossible to know what any military campaign would ultimately cost the only cost estimate we know of in this arena is the persian gulf war and that was a  billion event three

church of scientology in one interview in  daniels said of the organization that it is no church and that people on prozac were less likely to become victims of the organization the church of scientology responded by suing daniels in a libel suit for  million a judge dismissed the case eli lilly experienced dramatic growth during daniels tenure at the company prozac sales made up – of lillys income during the midtolate s and lilly doubled its assets to  billion and doubled its revenue to  billion during the same period when daniels later became governor of indiana he drew heavily on his former lilly colleagues to serve as advisers and agency managers during the same period daniels also served on the board of directors of the indianapolis power  light ipl he resigned from the ipl board in  to join the federal government and sold his ipl stock for  million later that year the value declined when virginiabased aes corporation bought ipl the indiana securities division subsequently investigated the sale and found no wrongdoing but opponents brought up the sale and questioned it during his later election campaign daniels has said his time in the private sector at eli lilly was the experience that most helped him to serve as an effective governor i probably learned more there daniels said in  i’ll say this i’ve enjoyed each opportunity but frequently i was asked later what previous experiences helped most to be an effective governor that sort of thing people would always expect me to name something from public life but probably the experience in business trying to manage for results trying to get large numbers of people aligned and headed in a common direction these were probably the most valuable days i spent  office of management and budgetedit in january  daniels accepted president george w bushs invitation to serve as director of the office of management and budget omb he served as director from january  through june  in this role he was also a member of the national security council and the homeland security council during his time as the director of the omb bush referred to him as the blade for his noted acumen at budget cutting the  trillion budget daniels submitted to congress in  would have made deep cuts in many agencies to accommodate the tax cuts being made but few of the spending cuts were actually approved by congress during daniels month tenure in the position the projected federal budget surplus of  billion declined to a  billion deficit due to an economic downturn and failure to enact spending cuts to offset the tax reductions following the september   attacks congress passed legislation authorizing the creation of the department of homeland security just before the legislation was signed by bush republican lawmakers inserted language into the bill that authorized protection from liability corporations that manufactured thimerosal a controversial vaccine preservative that has been the subject of multiple lawsuits eli lilly was once the largest maker of thimerosal and is a major target of the lawsuits daniels was the budget director at the time of the bills passing and some  have raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest congress repealed the thimerosal provision following expressions of public displeasure shortly after the invasion of afghanistan daniels gave a speech to the national press club in which he challenged the view of those who wanted to continue typical spending while the nation was at war “the idea of reallocating assets from less important to more important things especially in a time of genuine emergency makes common sense and is applied everywhere else in life” he said conservative columnist ross douthat stated in a column about daniels time at omb that daniels carried water as director of the office of management and budget for some of the bush administration’s more egregious budgets but douthat while calling daniels “america’s best governor” defended daniels against accusations that daniels inaccurately assessed the costs of the iraq war in the final days of  when an invasion of iraq was still a hypothetical question daniels told the new york times that the cost of war with iraq “could be” in the range of  to  billion it was not clear whether daniels was referring to the cost of a short invasion or a longer war but he did indicate the administration was budgeting for both he also described the “backoftheenvelope” estimate by bush economic advisor lawrence b lindsey that it would cost  to  billion as much too high two days later after the new years holiday an omb spokesperson clarified daniels’ remarks adding that the  to  billion figure was not a hard white house estimate and “it is impossible to know what any military campaign would ultimately cost the only cost estimate we know of in this arena is the persian gulf war and that was a  billion event three months later on march   five days after the start of the invasion president bush requested  billion through an emergency supplemental appropriation to cover operational expenses in iraq until september  of that year according to the congressional budget office military operations in iraq for  cost  billion less than the amount projected by daniels and omb douthat and other daniel’s defenders accuse daniels critics of mischaracterizing the sixmonth supplemental appropriation as a request to fund the entire war between september  and october  lawmakers appropriated about  trillion for operations in both the war in iraq and afghanistan governoredit election campaignedit main article indiana gubernatorial election  daniels decision to run for governor of indiana led to most of the rest of republican field of candidates to drop out of

he traveled in a donated white rv nicknamed rv and covered with signatures of supporters and his campaign slogan my man mitch my man mitch was a reference to a phrase once used by president george w bush to refer to daniels bush campaigned with daniels on two occasions as daniels hoped that bushs popularity would help him secure a win in his many public stops he frequently used the phrase every garden needs weeding every sixteen years or so it had been  years since indiana had had a republican governor his opponent in the general election was the incumbent joe kernan who had succeeded to the office upon the death of frank obannon campaign ads by kernan and the democratic party attempted to tie daniels to number of issues—his jail time for marijuana use a stock sale leading to speculations of insider trading and because of his role at eli lilly the high cost of prescription drugs the  election was the costliest in indiana history up until that time with the candidates spending a combined us million daniels won the election garnering about  of the vote compared to kernans  kernan was the first incumbent governor to lose an election in indiana since  first termedit mitch

daylight a lot of excrement” though teresa lubbers the state commissioner of higher education was mentioned in the emails regarding the statewide review of courses she later said that she was never asked to conduct the survey of courses described in the email exchanges and that her office did not conduct such a survey in one of the emails daniels expressed contempt for zinn upon his death this terrible antiamerican academic has finally passed awaythe obits and commentaries mentioned his book ‘a people’s history of the united states’ is the ‘textbook of choice in high schools and colleges

gas from the plant would make up about  percent of the states supply critics feared that if gas prices fell over the next  years the costs of the lost profits would be passed onto the bills of residents once the  million guarantee by leucadia was used up the deal also received criticism due to government intrusion in the energy markets questions were also raised due to leucadia national hiring mark lubbers to promote the deal lubbers is a former aide and close friend of daniels the daniels administration maintained that the plant would create jobs in an economically depressed part of

journal to policies espoused by the democraticmajority congress and the white house in august  the speculation has included daniels record of reforming government reducing taxes balancing the budget and connecting with voters in indiana despite his signing into law of bills that toughened drug enforcement regulated abortion and a defense of marriage act he has angered some conservatives because of his call for a truce on social issues so the party can focus on fiscal issuescitation needed his willingness to consider tax increases to rectify a budget deficit has been another source of contention in august  the economist praised daniels reverence for restraint and efficacy and concluded that he is in short just the kind of man to relish fixing a broken state—or country nick

doesnt matter what the general assembly does this is the right thing to do and we are going to do itthe same way families do the same way some governments do and all businesses do we are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue i know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend and i just think weve reached the point where we ought to break that pattern the first tuition freeze required the university to find  million in savings or new revenue in order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes daniels and the purdue board of trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology

scientology responded by suing daniels in a libel suit for  million a judge dismissed the case eli lilly experienced dramatic growth during daniels tenure at the company prozac sales made up – of lillys income during the midtolate s and lilly doubled its assets to  billion and doubled its revenue to  billion during the same period when daniels later became governor of indiana he drew heavily

lilly was the experience that most helped him to serve as an effective governor i probably learned more there daniels said in  i’ll say this i’ve enjoyed each opportunity but frequently i was asked later what previous experiences helped most to be an effective governor that sort of thing people would always expect me to name something from public life but probably the experience in business trying to manage for results trying to get large numbers of people aligned and headed in a common direction these were probably the most valuable days i spent  office of management and budgetedit in january  daniels accepted president george w bushs invitation to serve as director of the office of management and budget omb he served as director from january  through june  in this role he was also a member of the national security council and the homeland security council during his time as the director of the omb bush referred to him as the blade for his noted acumen at budget cutting the  trillion budget daniels submitted to congress in  would have made deep cuts in many agencies to accommodate the tax cuts being made but few of the spending cuts were actually approved by congress during daniels month tenure in the position the projected federal budget surplus of  billion declined to a  billion deficit due to an economic downturn and failure to enact spending cuts to offset the tax reductions following the september   attacks congress passed legislation authorizing the creation of the department of homeland security just before the legislation was signed by bush republican lawmakers inserted language into the bill that authorized protection from liability corporations that manufactured thimerosal a controversial vaccine preservative that has been the subject of multiple lawsuits eli lilly was once the largest maker of thimerosal and is a major target of the lawsuits daniels was the budget director at the time of the bills passing and some  have raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest congress repealed the thimerosal provision following expressions of public displeasure shortly after the invasion of afghanistan daniels gave a speech to the national press club in which he challenged the view of those who wanted to continue typical spending while the nation was at war “the idea of reallocating assets from less important to more important things especially in a time of genuine emergency makes common sense and is applied everywhere else in life” he said conservative columnist ross douthat stated in a column about daniels time at omb that daniels carried water as director of the office of management and budget for some of the bush administration’s more egregious budgets but douthat while calling daniels “america’s best governor” defended daniels against accusations that daniels inaccurately assessed the costs of the iraq war in the final days of  when an invasion of iraq was still a hypothetical question daniels told the new york times that the cost of war with iraq “could be” in the range of  to  billion it was not clear whether daniels was referring to the cost of a short invasion or a longer war but he did indicate the administration was budgeting for both he also described the “backoftheenvelope” estimate by bush economic advisor lawrence b lindsey that it would cost  to  billion as much too high two days later after the new years holiday an omb spokesperson clarified daniels’ remarks adding that the  to  billion figure was not a hard white house estimate and “it is impossible to know what any military campaign would ultimately cost the only cost estimate we know of in this arena is the persian gulf war and that was a  billion event three months later on march   five days after the start of the invasion president bush requested  billion through an emergency supplemental appropriation to cover operational expenses in iraq until september  of that year according to the congressional budget office military operations in iraq for  cost  billion less than the amount projected by daniels and omb douthat and other daniel’s defenders accuse daniels critics of mischaracterizing the sixmonth supplemental appropriation as a request to fund the entire war between september  and october  lawmakers appropriated about  trillion for operations in both the war in iraq and afghanistan governoredit election campaignedit main article indiana gubernatorial election  daniels decision to run for governor of indiana led to most of the rest of republican field of candidates to drop out of the race the only challenger who did not do so was conservative activist and lobbyist eric miller miller worked for the phoenix group a christian rights defense group daniels campaign platform centered on cutting the state budget and privatizing public agencies he won the primary with  of the vote while campaigning in the general election daniels visited all  counties at least three times he traveled in a donated white rv nicknamed rv and covered with signatures of supporters and his campaign slogan my man mitch my man mitch was a reference to a phrase once used by president george w bush to refer to daniels bush campaigned with daniels on two occasions as daniels hoped that bushs popularity would help him secure a win in his many public stops he frequently used the phrase every garden needs weeding every sixteen years or so it had been  years since indiana had had a republican governor his opponent in the general election was the incumbent joe kernan who had succeeded to the office upon the death of frank obannon campaign ads by kernan and the democratic party attempted to tie daniels to number of issues—his jail time for marijuana use a stock sale leading to speculations of insider trading and because of his role at eli lilly the high cost of prescription drugs the  election was the costliest in indiana history up until that time with the candidates spending a combined us million daniels won the election garnering about  of the vote compared to kernans  kernan was the first incumbent governor to lose an election in indiana since  first termedit mitch daniels visits camp arifjan in kuwait on his first day in office daniels created indianas first office of management and budget to look for inefficiencies and cost savings throughout state government

improve the states fiscal situation indiana has a biennial budget and had a projected twoyear deficit of  million daniels called for strict controls on all spending increases and reducing the annual growth rate of the budget he also proposed a oneyear  tax increase on all individuals and entities earning over  the taxing proposal was controversial and the republican speaker of the house brian bosma criticized daniels and refused to allow the proposal to be debated the general assembly approved  million in spending cuts and daniels renegotiated  different state contracts for a savings of  million resulting in a budget of  billion annual spending growth for future budgets was cut to  from the  that had been standard for many years increase in revenues coupled with the spending reductions led to a  million budget surplus indiana is not permitted to take loans as borrowing was prohibited in its constitution following the  state bankruptcy the state therefore had financed its deficit spending by reallocating  million in revenue that belonged to local government and school districts over the course of many years the funds were gradually and fully restored to the municipal governments using the surplus money and the state reserve fund was grown to  billion two of daniels other tax proposals were approved a tax on liquor and beverages to fund the construction of the lucas oil stadium and a tax on rental cars to expand the indiana convention center the new source of funding resulted in a state takeover of a project initially started by the city of indianapolis and led to a bitter feud between daniels and the city leadership over who should have ownership of the project the state ultimately won and took ownership of the facilities from the city in  daniels continued his effort to reduce state operating costs by signing into law a bill privatizing the enrollment service for the states welfare programs indianas welfare enrollment facilities were replaced with call centers operated by ibm in mid after complaints of poor service daniels canceled the contract and returned the enrollment service to the public sector daylight saving timeedit one of the most controversial measures daniels successfully pushed through was the state adoption of daylight saving time which daniels argued would save the state money on energy costs although the state is in the eastern time zone indianas counties had adopted their own time zone practices and in practice the state effectively observed two different times and the central part of the state maintained a single time—eastern standard—year round interests for both est and cst time zones had prevented the official adoption of daylight saving since the s and had led to decades of debate daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to central time but the general assembly could not come to terms ultimately after a long debate they adopted eastern daylight saving time in april  the measure passing by one vote putting all but northwestern and southwestern indiana on the same time for the first time highwaysedit a controversial plan known as the major moves plan was passed in  the indiana toll road was leased to statewide mobility partners a joint venture company owned by spanish firm cintra and australias macquarie infrastructure group for  years in exchange for a one time payment of  billion the measure was opposed by most democrats who began an advertising campaign accusing daniels of selling the road to foreign nations the income from the lease was used to finance a backlog of public transportation projects and create a  million trust fund to generate revenue for the maintenance of the highway system daniels support for such controversial legislation led to a rapid drop in his approval rating in may  a poll showed an point drop in support and that only  of hoosiers approved of the way he was doing his job in the following months many of his reforms began to have a positive effect and his ratings began to improve and his approval rebounded economic developmentedit main article indiana economic development corporation governor daniels addresses state and federal

already possess another type of state id a coalition of civil rights groups began a court challenge of the bill in indiana state courts and the daniels administration defended the government in the case the indiana supreme court ruled in favor of the state in late  the petitioners appealed the bill to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit and that body upheld the state

in the indiana house of representatives in the  and  elections this caused indiana to have a divided government with democrats controlling the indiana house of representatives and the republicans controlling the governors office and the indiana senate this also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate which caused mitch daniels call a special session of the indiana general assembly the state was faced with a  billion shortfall in revenue for the – budget years daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and costsaving measures in his budget proposal the general assembly approved some of his proposals but relied heavily on the states reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall daniels signed the  billion twoyear budget into law  legislative walkoutedit see also  indiana legislative walkouts in the  midterm elections republican supermajorities regained control of the house and took control of the senate giving the party full control of general assembly for the first time in daniels tenure as governor the  indiana general assemblys regular legislative session began in january and the large republicans majorities attempted to implement a wideranging conservative agenda largely backed by daniels most of the agenda had been dormant since daniels election due to divided control of the assembly in february republican legislators attempted to pass a right to work bill in the indiana house of representatives the bill would have made it illegal for employees to be required to join a workers union republicans argued that it would help the state attract new employers unable to prevent the measure from passing democratic legislators fled the state to deny the body quorum while several hundred protesters staged demonstrations at the capital minority walkouts are somewhat common in the state occurring as recently as  while daniels supported the legislation he believed the republican lawmakers should drop the bill because it was not part of their election platform and deserved a period of public debate republicans subsequently dropped the bill but the democratic lawmakers still refused to return to the capital demanding additional bills be tabled including a bill to create a statewide school voucher program their refusal to return left the indiana general assembly unable to pass any legislation until three of the twelve bills they objected to were dropped from the agenda on march  the minority subsequently returned to the statehouse to resume their duties daniels was interviewed in february  about the similar  wisconsin budget protests in madison while supporting the wisconsin republicans he said that in indiana were not in quite the same position or advocating quite the same things they are up in madison educationedit following the legislative walkouts the assembly began passing most of the agenda and daniels signed the bills into law written in collaboration with indiana superintendent of public instruction tony bennett a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools a statewide school voucher program was enacted children in homes with an income under  could receive vouchers equal to  of the cost of their public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school it provides lesser benefits to households with income over  the program will be gradually phased in over a threeyear period and would be available to all state residents by  other funds were redirected to creating and expanding charter schools and expanding college scholarship programs the

collective bargaining rights of teachers wgu indiana was established through an executive order on june   by daniels as a partnership between the state and western governors university in an effort to expand access to higher education for indiana residents and increase the percentage of the state’s adult population with education beyond high school curriculum and fundingedit in july  the associated press obtained emails under indiana open record laws in which daniels asked for assurances that a textbook the peoples history of the united states written by historian howard zinn is not in use anywhere in indiana daniels wrote in  this crap should not be accepted for any credit by the state daniels emails were addressed to scott jenkins his education adviser and david shane a top fundraiser and state school board member daniels and his aides came to agreement and the governor wrote to them “go for it disqualify propaganda  part of shanes input was that a statewide review “would force to daylight a lot of excrement” though teresa lubbers the state commissioner of higher education was mentioned in the emails regarding the statewide review of courses she later said that she was never asked to conduct the survey of courses described in the email exchanges and that her office did not conduct such a survey in one of the emails daniels expressed contempt for zinn upon his death this terrible antiamerican academic has finally passed awaythe obits and commentaries mentioned his book ‘a people’s history of the united states’ is the ‘textbook of choice in high schools and colleges around the country’ it is a truly execrable antifactual piece of disinformation that misstates american history on every page can someone assure me that it is not in use anywhere in indiana if it is how do we get rid of it before more young people are forcefed a totally false version of our history three years later in the wake of the revelations  of purdues roughly  professors issued an open letter expressing their concern over daniels commitment to academic freedom daniels responded by saying that if zinn were alive and a member of the purdue faculty he would defend his free speech rights and right to publish in a letter responding to the professors daniels wrote in truth my emails infringed on no ones academic freedom and proposed absolutely no censorship of any person or viewpoint in a separate and unrelated round of emails composed in  indiana education officials shared concerns with daniels about the lobbying resources and activities of the indiana urban schools association daniels asked that the administration examine cutting them out at least of the funding surge we are planning for the next couple yrs the executive director of iusa is charles little an indiana universitypurdue university indianapolis professor of education who had criticized him it wasn’t immediately clear if the audit went through daniels said he had never heard of charles little abortionedit on april   the indiana legislature passed a bill authored by state rep eric turner that prohibited taxpayer dollars from supporting organizations that performed abortions the legislation also prohibited abortions for women more than  weeks pregnant four weeks sooner than the previous law although daniels would later say he supported the bill from the outset it was not part of his legislative agenda and he did not indicate whether he would sign or veto the law until after it passed the general assembly daniels signed the bill on may   planned parenthood and the aclu subsequently brought a lawsuit against the state alleging it was being targeted unfairly that the state law violated federal medicaid laws and that their fourteenth amendment rights were violated a may  ruling allowing the case to move forward but denied the request from the petitioners to grant a temporary injunction to restore the funding however a june  ruling prohibited the state from enforcing the law immigrationedit on may  daniels signed into law two immigration bills one denying instate tuition prices to illegal immigrants and another creating fines for employers that employed illegal immigrants several protestors at least five of whom were illegal immigrants were arrested while protesting the law at the statehouse when they broke into daniels office after being denied a meeting student leaders called for their release while some state legislators called for their deportation state democratic party leaders accused daniels and the republicans of passing controversial legislation only to enhance daniels image so he could seek the presidency daniels however denied the charges saying he would have enacted the same agenda years earlier had the thendemocratic majority permitted him to do so budget cutsedit the state forecast continued revenue declines in  that would result in a  billion budget shortfall if the state budget grew at its normal rate daniels submitted a twoyear  billion spending plan to the general assembly which would result in a  million surplus that would be used to rebuild the state reserve funds to  billion he proposed a wide range of budget austerity measures including employee furloughing spending reductions freezing state hiring freezing state employee wages and a host of administrative changes for state agencies the state had already been gradually reducing its workforce by similar freezes and by  indiana had the fewest state employees per capita than any other state—a figure daniels touted to say indiana had the nations smallest government daniels backed the creation of additional toll roads expanding on his  overhaul of the indiana toll road system known as major moves in an attempt to secure an additional source of revenue for the state but opposition from within his own party led to the bill being withdrawn by its republican sponsor sen tom wyss which resulted in danielss only significant legislative defeat during the  session the legislative walkouts delayed progress on the budget passage for nearly two months but the house of representatives was able to begin working on it in committee in april the body made several alterations to the bill including a reapportionment of education funding based more heavily on the number of students at a school and removing some public school funding to finance the new voucher system and charter schools energyedit daniels announced in october  that a substitute natural gas company intended to build a facility in southern indiana that would produce pipeline quality substitute natural gas sng the lead investor was leucadia national which proposed a  billion plant in rockport indiana under the terms of the deal endorsed by daniels the state would buy almost all the rockport gas and resell it on the open market throughout the country if the plant made money from the sale excess profits would be split between leucadia nationals indiana subsidiary indiana gassification and the state if it lost money from the sale then  of the losses would be passed onto indiana consumers leucadia agreed to reimburse the state for any losses up to  million over  years gas from the plant would make up about  percent of the states supply critics feared that if gas prices fell over the next  years the costs of the lost profits would be passed onto the bills of residents once the  million guarantee by leucadia was used up the deal also received criticism due to government intrusion in the energy markets questions were also raised due to leucadia national hiring mark lubbers to promote the deal lubbers is a former aide and close friend of daniels the daniels administration maintained that the plant would create jobs in an economically depressed part of the state and offer environmental benefits through an instate energy source the project was ultimately panned by the state legislature in  right to workedit indiana became the first state in a decade to adopt right to work legislation indiana is home to many manufacturing jobs the indiana economic development corp has reported that  firms said the new law was an important factor in deciding to move to indiana gov daniels signed the legislation on feb   without much fanfare in the hopes of dispersing labor protesters before the super bowl in indianapolis  presidential speculationedit although daniels had claimed to be reluctant to seek higher office many media outlets including politico the weekly standard forbes the washington post cnn the economist and the indianapolis star began to speculate that daniels may intend to seek the republican nomination for president in  after he joined the national debate on cap and trade legislation by penning a response in the wall street journal to policies espoused by the democraticmajority congress and the white house in august  the speculation has included daniels record of reforming government reducing taxes balancing the budget and connecting with voters in indiana despite his signing into law of bills that toughened drug enforcement regulated abortion and a defense of marriage act he has angered some conservatives because of his call for a truce on social issues so the party can focus on fiscal issuescitation needed his willingness to consider tax increases to rectify a budget deficit has been another source of contention in august  the economist praised daniels reverence for restraint and efficacy and concluded that he is in short just the kind of man to relish fixing a broken state—or country nick gillespie of reason called daniels a smart and effective leader who is a serious thinker about history politics and policy and wrote that daniels like former new mexico gov gary johnson is a republican who knows how to govern and can do it well in february  david brooks of the new york times described daniels as the partys strongest would be candidate predicting that he couldnt match obama in grace and elegance but he could on substance on december   daniels suggested in a local interview that he would decide on a white house run before may  different groups and individuals pressured daniels to run for office in response to early speculation daniels dismissed a presidential run in june  saying ive only ever run for or held one office its the last one im going to hold however in february  he told a washington post reporter that he was open to the idea of running in  on march   daniels was the winner of an oregon republican party straw poll daniels drew  of the vote besting second place finisher mitt romney  and third place finisher sarah palin  and was the winner of a similar straw poll in the state of washington on may   daniels told an interviewer that he would announce within weeks his decision of whether or not to run for the republican presidential nomination he said he felt he was not prepared to debate on all the national issues like foreign policy and needed time to better understand the issues and put together formal positions later in may as the republican field began to resolve with announcements and withdrawals of other candidates time said even setting aside his somewhat unusual family situation daniels would need to hurry to put together an organization and raise enough money if he intended to run daniels announced he would not seek the republican nomination for the presidency on the night of may   via an email to the press citing family constraints and the loss of privacy the family would experience should he become a candidate  presidential speculationedit in january  the republican national committee sent an email to subscribers asking them to pick their top three presidential choices the poll included thirty two potential candidates including daniels in march  fortune magazine named daniels no  on its list of the worlds  greatest leaders generating a new round of calls for daniels to consider his options in  daniels was the only american university president and the only national political figure excluding detroit mayor mike duggan to make the global list purdue universityedit purdue university president mitch daniels talks with agriculture secretary tom vilsack in  selectionedit the purdue university board of trustees unanimously elected mitch daniels president of purdue university on june   as governor daniels had appointed  of the  board members and had reappointed the other two which critics claimed was a conflict of interest a state investigation released in october  found that the circumstances did not violate the indiana code of ethics other critics of his selection pointed out that unlike previous purdue presidents he lacked a background in academia his term as president began upon completion of his term as governor in january  in preparation for his term as president of purdue university daniels stopped participating in partisan political activity during the  election cycle and focused instead on issues related to higher education and fiscal matters in order to avoid the financial cost of a formal inauguration daniels instead wrote an open letter to the people of purdue in which he documented the challenges facing higher education and outlined his initial priorities such as affordability academic excellence and academic freedom daniels has continued this practice opting to send open letters to the purdue community instead of giving a formal state of the university speech as is more common in higher education student interactionsedit daniels works out daily at the student gym and eats frequently with students in student dining facilities in march  he joined forces with a group of engineering students to create a viral music video promoting engineering and purdue university within  hours the video had received over  views purdue home football games feature a segment entitled wheres mitch in which the stadium video board shows the camera panning the crowd and eventually finding daniels sitting among the fans sometimes in the student section former purdue presidents rarely left their suite in the pressbox structure tuition freezes and cost reductionsedit the total cost of attending purdue has fallen since daniels assumed purdue’s presidency despite a trend at big ten institutions of rising costs total loan debt among the student body has also fallen  or  million tuition at purdue prior to daniels’ arrival had increased every year since  two months after daniels assumed his role as president purdue announced it would freeze tuition for two years eventually extending the freeze for six years through  as a result multiple graduating classes have become the first in at least  years to leave purdue having never experienced a tuition increase instate tuition is more than  lower than if the university had raised rates at the national average and students and families have saved more than  million in educational expenses daniels announced the first tuition freeze before the state had determined purdues funding for the next biennium amidst questions about the timing daniels argued that he didnt need to wait because it doesnt matter what the general assembly does this is the right thing to do and we are going to do itthe same way families do the same way some governments do and all businesses do we are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue i know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend and i just think weve reached the point where we ought to break that pattern the first tuition freeze required the university to find  million in savings or new revenue in order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes daniels and the purdue board of trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers investing cash reserves and switching to a consumerdriven health plan for employees daniels also reduced meal plan rates for students by  percent froze housing costs and cut the universitys cooperative education fees which had increased every year prior on record in fall  daniels announced a deal with amazon to save students on textbooks and provide students faculty and staff with free one day shipping to locations on campus daniels has stated that the amazon partnership saves students more than  a semester and has provided purdue with  in new scholarship funds agendaedit

hiring of  new faculty in stem disciplines expansion of flipped classrooms growing summer enrollment investments in plant science and drug discovery research and the creation of competencybased degree

percent and broke the university record for patents in  daniels announced plans to start the purdue polytechnic indianapolis high school designed to be a bridge for innercity students to purdue by admitting graduates directly to purdue daniels described the high school as an attempt to increase the number of lowincome firstgeneration and minority students who are prepared for purdue the high school will not open until  but purdue reported record levels of minority and underrepresented students in the fall  semester daniels also has emphasized free speech and inquiry by becoming the first public institution to adopt the chicago principles for free speech and inquiry and one of roughly two dozen universities to receive the highest rating from the foundation for individual rights in education in  daniels and the purdue board of trustees announced its intention to acquire kaplan university for the purpose of transforming it into an online purdue program compensationedit when

of florida your daily briefing presidential pay leadership  governance mitch daniels finds good food and a willingness to change at purdue leadership  governance mitch daniels finds good food and a willingness to change at purdue mitchell e daniels jr purdue university by eric kelderman october   video produced by carmen mendoza and julia schmalz purdues president began his job in january  with no leadership experience in academe what he has learned since then is that small but meaningful changes can lead to big savings for students   eric kelderman were here today with mitch daniels currently the president of purdue university since january  and before that a very long career in politics and business most notably as the governor of indiana welcome to the chronicle mr daniels mitchell e daniels jr i appreciate being here eric kelderman yeah were glad you could make it you have become i would say something of a poster boy in news stories about university leaders that have come from outside academic backgrounds and i want to know from your point of view after almost three years on the job when you look back what are some of the most surprising or shocking or interesting things that youve learned about the university that you didnt know when you were say governor mitchell e daniels jr oh there are a lot of those first of all its not that unusual and im certainly not campaigning to be on anybodys poster theres a lot of people many of whom i conferred with before i took up my duties david boren bob gates lots and lots of people out there who came from other than a life in academia but still plenty of surprises sometimes i start that answer by saying the food its an extraordinary quality and variety of food that college students eat i eat with students on a fairly frequent basis and i always tease them about the fact that college foods not supposed to be like this related content mitch daniels isnt rebuilding purdues engine hes tuning it  premium former governors first year of leading purdue brings him a few surprises a faculty’s stand on trigger warnings stirs fears among students  premium but likewise i think ive been pleasantly surprised by the receptiveness at least on the purdue campus of people to try some new things and to commit in our case particularly to keeping a purdue education while still rigorous and undiluted affordable eric kelderman before you took over the job you said you were pleasantly surprised at peoples willingness to change were you under the impression that change would be much more difficult at purdue than it has been say mitchell e daniels jr oh i didnt know what rate to expect and dont get me wrong higher ed moves pretty slowly relative to other realms but everybody knows that there are jokes about it and books about it and i guess im just saying that ive found purdue in this and other respects relatively a more congenial place to the sort of changes but also just the sort of emphases that i think are important in higher ed today affordability rigor accountability and so forth eric kelderman before you even started your job as you know there was a lot of concern there were critics out there that were worried that you would come to the university that the budget cuts you would make would be draconian that might be targeted for instance at humanities or other large programs that your past or your conservative political views might also somehow influence the direction or academic appointments things like that what have you done over the past three years to sort of quell those concerns and do you feel confident that youve sort of won over your critics at this point mitchell e daniels jr all i can say is there wasnt that much noise at the beginning there hasnt been any for a long time so i hope that anybody who was laboring under complete misperceptions like that or misconceptions has been pleasantly surprised no i mean we are serious about affordability purdue you would know were midway through at least a fouryear freeze on tuition in and out of state but we had a  salary increase or pool for salary increases last year largest in our peer group and maybe one of the largest anywhere so were very committed to investing heavily in the university making major investments expansion of our engineering college computer science school our socalled purdue polytechnic institute which is an interesting transformation of traditional pedagogy in that area deep investments in research in highly specific and selected areas so these things can coexist and were committed to all of them those folks who had apprehensions in the beginning i hope are feeling a little differently now and as for the liberal arts im a product of the liberal arts eric kelderman oh you are mitchell e daniels jr im an advocate for the liberal arts ive raised substantial money for endowed chairs and the like and i see a bigger role frankly for them in purdues future so working on all these fronts eric kelderman right when you talk about the savings for students and youve frozen tuition for four years and youve made i believe it was initially a  reduction in room and board costs for students and thats remained stable right mitchell e daniels jr yeah well we did two of those eric kelderman right mitchell e daniels jr in board costs eric kelderman oh excellent when you were poring over the budget what were the areas that you found i guess most right for cuts mitchell e daniels jr yeah well there have been some significant steps forward a good example is the health care plan which was i would say very outmoded and by modernizing it making it more consumerist first of all weve seen rapid adoption from one quarter to three quarters of our faculty and staff have adopted a consumerist hsatype model and they have lowered their premiums substantially but the school has exceeded expectations in lowering the overall cost that were occurring so that was one big stroke but the point ive made eric very often learned it in business seen it elsewhere seen it government there are only so many places i like to say where you can take a cleaver and take a great big piece of fat out the issue and i really see it in higher ed is the fat is marbled throughout the animal and so you have to be willing to look everywhere and you have to try to get others in the act not do this topdown so for instance when we first froze tuition we asked the campus everybody please participate we created an account to offset what would otherwise have been a th consecutive year of tuition increase and asked people to submit ideas for reductions small or large and we also asked people if they wanted to to forgo a pay increase and many did this year a variation on that when we announced  increase its fair to say this was a positive surprise but i did say every department every college every unit gets  regardless to get the extra half percent we need you to come forward with a plan that will help us become a little more efficient a plan for spending reductions and in particular a plan for better space utilization could you schedule more classes on slow periods than we currently have this sort of thing so by the way every unit every college and every administrative unit chose to earn the half a point eric kelderman yeah mitchell e daniels jr and have more for everyones salary and we got as i say a lot of improvements across the campus that could not have been spotted by somebody sitting at the center eric kelderman right great well thank you very much for your time today mitchell e daniels jr yeah sure eric kelderman its great having you here to the chronicle   eric kelderman writes about money and accountability in higher education including such areas as state
