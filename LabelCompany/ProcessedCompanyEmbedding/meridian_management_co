important part of apartment living is protecting your property and guarding your personal liability if any of your personal property is damaged destroyed or stolen due to occurrences such as natural disasters accidents smoke vandalism theft water damage and more renter’s insurance will typically cover repair or replacement of your personal property if your home is made unlivable by one of these occurrences renter’s insurance will pay for the associated expenses such as temporary residence meals etc coverage is usually limited to a percentage of the total policy value renter’s insurance gives you the security of knowing that if you lost everything today you wouldn’t have to start from scratch we strongly suggest that you discuss the advantages of renter’s insurance also known as multiperil risk insurance coverage with your insurance agent renter’s insurance is relatively inexpensive and often the insurer offers a discount if you carry both auto and renter’s insurance policies with the
