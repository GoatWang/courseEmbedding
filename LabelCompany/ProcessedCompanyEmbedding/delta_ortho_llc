adjustments worthwhilebe sure to scroll to the bottom of this page to check out our instructional video eating with braces what can you eat lets talk about what you shouldnt eat if youve been wanting to drop a few pounds the first week wearing braces is just your chance for the first day or so stick to soft foods avoid tough meats hard breads and raw vegetables before long youll be able to bite a cucumber again but youll need to protect your orthodontic appliances when you eat for as long as youre wearing braces foods to avoid chewy foods bagels hard rolls licorice crunchy foods popcorn ice chips sticky foods caramels gum hard foods nuts candy foods you have to bite into corn on the cob apples carrots chewing on hard things for example pens pencils or fingernails can damage the braces damaged braces will cause treatment to take longer general soreness when you get your braces on you may feel general soreness in your mouth and teeth may be tender to biting pressures for three to five days this can be relieved by rinsing your mouth with a warm saltwater mouthwash dissolve one teaspoonful of salt in  ounces of warm water and rinse your mouth vigorously if the tenderness is severe take aspirin or whatever you normally take for headache or similar pain the lips cheeks and tongue may also become irritated for one to two weeks as they toughen and become accustomed to the surface of the braces you can put wax on the braces to lessen this well show you how loosening of teeth this is to be expected throughout treatment dont worry its normal teeth must loosen first so they can be moved the teeth will again become rigidly fixed in their new corrected positions loose wire or band dont be alarmed if a wire or band comes loose this happens occasionally if wire protrudes and is irritating use a blunt instrument back of a spoon or the eraser end of a pencil and carefully gently push the irritating wire under the archwire simply get it out of the way if irritation to the lips or mouth continues place wax or wet cotton on the wire to reduce the annoyance call our office as soon as possible for an appointment to check and repair the appliances if any piece comes off save it and bring it with you to the office care of appliances to successfully complete the treatment plan the patient must work together with the orthodontist the teeth and jaws can only move toward their corrected positions if the patient consistently wears the rubber bands headgear or other appliances as prescribed damaged appliances lengthen the treatment time brushing its more important than ever to brush and floss regularly when you have braces so the teeth and gums are healthy after orthodontic treatment patients who do not keep their teeth clean may require more frequent visits to the dentist for a professional cleaning adults who have a history of gum disease should also see a periodontist during orthodontic treatment
