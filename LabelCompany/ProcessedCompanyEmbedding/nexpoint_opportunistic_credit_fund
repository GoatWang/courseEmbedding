loans or other securities that are rated below investment grade and unrated senior loans deemed by highland to be of comparable quality securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “high yield securities” or “junk securities” they are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company’s continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments investments in high yield senior loans and other securities may result in greater nav fluctuation than if the fund did not make such investments currency risk the risk that the values of foreign investments may be affected by changes  in the currency rates or exchange control regulations debt securities risk the fund’s ability to invest in highyield debt securities generally subjects the fund to greater risk than securities with higher ratings derivatives risk  derivatives such as futures and options are subject to the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index derivatives also expose the fund to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty derivative contracts may expire worthless and the use of derivatives may result in losses to the fund nondiversification risk as a nondiversified fund the fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in the securities of one or a few issuers than a diversified fund nonpayment risk senior loans like other corporate debt obligations are subject to the risk of nonpayment of scheduled interest andor principal nonpayment would result in a reduction of income to the fund a reduction in the value of the senior loan experiencing nonpayment and a potential decrease in the nav of the fund senior loans risk the risks associated with senior loans are similar to the risks of below investment grade securities in that they are considered speculative in addition as with any debt instrument senior loans are also generally subject to the risk of price declines and to increases in prevailing interest rates senior loans are also subject to the risk that as interest rates rise the cost of borrowing increases which may also increase the risk and rate of default in addition the interest rates of floating rate loans typically only adjust to changes in shortterm interest rates long term interest rates can vary dramatically from short term interest rates therefore senior loans may not mitigate price declines in a rising longterm interest rate environment glossary click for important terms and definitions source state street bank and trust

general partner of the advisor as of february   none of the independent trustees or their immediate family members owned beneficially or of record any securities issued by the adviser the principal underwriter or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser or principal underwriter role of the board of trustees leadership structure and risk oversight the role of the board of trustees the board oversees the management and operations of the fund like most registered investment companies the daytoday management and operation of the fund is performed by various service providers to the fund such as the adviser and the distributor administrator custodian and transfer agent the board has appointed senior employees of certain of these service providers as officers of the fund with responsibility to monitor and report to the board on the funds operations the board receives regular reports from these officers and service providers regarding the funds operations for example the treasurer provides reports as to financial reporting matters and investment personnel report on the performance of the fund the board has appointed a chief compliance officer who administers the funds compliance program and regularly reports to the board as to compliance matters some of these reports are provided as part of formal inperson board meetings which are typically held quarterly in person and involve the boards review of among other items recent fund operations the board also periodically holds telephonic meetings as part of its review of the funds activities from time to time one or more members of the board may also meet with management in less formal settings between scheduled board meetings to discuss various topics in all cases however the role of the board and of any individual trustee is one of oversight and not of management of the daytoday affairs of the fund and its oversight role does not make the board a guarantor of the funds investments operations or activities board structure and leadership the board has structured itself in a manner that it believes allows it to perform its oversight function effectively the board currently consists of five trustees four of whom are not interested persons as defined in the  act and are independent as defined in rule a of the new york stock exchange listed company    manual the remaining trustee mr powell is currently treated as an interested person of the fund an interested trustee mr powell is treated as an interested trustee because of his previous positions with affiliates of the adviser and the possibility that he may provide consulting services to affiliates of the adviser mr powell also serves as chairman of the board the board believes that it is in the best interests of the fund for mr powell to lead the board because of his familiarity with the fund complex from his former positions with affiliates of the adviser and his broad experience in the investment industry and with the daytoday management and operation of other investment funds as described below the trustees meet periodically throughout the year in person and by telephone to oversee the funds activities review contractual arrangements with service providers for the fund and review the funds performance during the fiscal year ended december   the board convened ten times each trustee attended at least  of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the board and committees on which he served during the periods that he served the board does not have a lead independent trustee as noted below the boards leadership structure features each of the independent trustees serving as a member of one or more board committees inclusion of independent trustees in the committees allows them to participate in the full range of the boards oversight duties including oversight of the risk management process in addition although the independent trustees recognize that having a lead independent trustee may in some circumstances help coordinate communications with management and otherwise assist a board in the exercise of its oversight duties the independent trustees believe that because of the relatively small size of the board the ratio of independent trustees to the interested trustee and the good working relationship among the board members it has not been necessary to designate a lead independent trustee the board periodically reviews its leadership structure including the role of the chairman the board also completes an annual selfassessment during which it reviews its leadership and committee structure and considers whether its structure remains appropriate in light of the funds current operations the board believes that its leadership structure including the current percentage of the board who are independent trustees is appropriate given its specific characteristics these characteristics include i the extent to which the work of the board is conducted through the standing committees each of whose meetings are chaired by an independent trustee ii the extent to which the independent trustees meet as needed together with their independent legal counsel in the absence of members of management and any member of the board who is considered an interested person of the fund and iii mr powells previous positions with affiliates of the adviser and the possibility that he may provide consulting services to affiliates of the adviser and mr honis previous position with an affiliate of the adviser both of which enhance the boards understanding of the operations of the adviser board oversight of risk management  the boards role is one of oversight rather than active management this oversight extends to the funds risk management processes these processes are embedded in the responsibilities of officers of and service providers to the fund for example the adviser and other service providers to the fund are primarily responsible for the management of the funds investment risks the board has not established a formal risk oversight committee however much of the regular work of the board and its standing committees addresses aspects of risk oversight for example the trustees seek to understand the key risks facing the fund including those involving conflicts of interest how management identifies and monitors these risks on an ongoing basis how management develops and implements controls to mitigate these risks and how management tests the effectiveness of those controls in the course of providing that oversight the board receives a wide range of reports on the funds activities from the adviser and other service providers including reports regarding the funds investment portfolio the compliance of the fund with applicable laws and the funds financial accounting and reporting the board also meets periodically with the funds chief compliance officer to receive reports regarding the compliance of the fund with the federal securities laws and the funds internal compliance policies and procedures and meets with the funds chief compliance officer periodically including at least annually to review the chief compliance officers annual report including the chief compliance officers riskbased analysis for the fund the boards    audit and qualified legal compliance committee the audit committee also meets regularly with the treasurer and the funds independent registered public accounting firm to discuss among other things the internal control structure of the funds financial reporting function the board also meets periodically with the portfolio managers of the fund to receive reports regarding the management of the fund including its investment risks the board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the fund can be identified that it may not be practical or costeffective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks that it may be necessary to bear certain risks such as investmentrelated risks to achieve the funds goals that reports received by the trustees with respect to risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant information and that the processes procedures and controls employed to address risks may be limited in their effectiveness as a result of the foregoing and other factors risk management oversight by the board and by the committees is subject to substantial limitations committees of the board the board conducts much of its work through certain standing committees the board has five committees the audit and qualified legal compliance committee the governance committee the compliance committee the distribution oversight committee and the alternatives oversight committee which are

dr bob froehlich independent trustee of the fund based solely on a review of copies of such reports of ownership furnished to the fund the fund believes that during the past fiscal year all other officers trustees and greater than  beneficial holders of the fund complied with all applicable filing requirements proposal  approval of a change to the funds fundamental policy regarding concentration the funds board has approved and recommends that shareholders of the fund approve a proposal to change the funds fundamental policy regarding concentration currently the funds fundamental investment policy regarding concentration provides that the fund may not invest  or more of the value of its total assets in any single industry or group of industries the current policy the current policy may not be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common shares and preferred shares if any voting together as a single class and of the holders of a majority of the outstanding preferred shares if any voting as a separate class the board approved a change in the fundamental policy regarding concentration for the fund based upon the recommendation of the funds adviser that the fund would be better able to pursue its investment objectives to provide both current income and capital appreciation if it were to concentrate its investments in the real estate industry the adviser noted that due to the funds current fundamental investment policy the funds is currently precluded from investing additional assets in the real estate industry and therefore cannot take advantage of certain investment opportunities the adviser believes would be beneficial to the fund the board considered nexpoints expertise and the breadth of opportunities available in the real estate industry noting that in the three years ended december   nexpoint and its affiliates highland have completed approximately  billion of commercial real estate transactions the board also considered that highland manages various investment vehicles that primarily invest in real estate related assets including two whollyowned real estate investment trust reit subsidiaries of the fund a real estate focused closedend interval fund overseen by the board nresf a nontraded multifamily reit and a publically traded multifamily reit the board further noted that although past performance is no guarantee of future results the funds investments in the real estate industry have performed well during the past five years with preferred equity real estate positions in one of the funds reit subsidiaries contributing meaningfully to the funds performance for the fiscal year ended december   the board considered that the proposed change to the funds fundamental policy would better position the fund to take advantage of highlands experience in the real estate sector and could provide additional opportunities for the fund to fulfill its investment objectives though there is no guarantee that any of the funds investments in the real estate industry or otherwise will be successful or that the fund will achieve its investment objectives the board also considered the risks inherent in the proposed change including that increasing the percentage of the funds total assets that can be invested in the securities of issuers in the real estate industry increases the risk that the fund will be adversely affected by events impacting the real estate industry additionally a concentrated fund would be more significantly affected by events impacting the real estate industry than would a fund that was not so concentrated financial economic business and other developments affecting issuers in the real estate industry will have a greater effect on the fund and if securities of the real estate industry fall out of favor the fund could underperform or its net asset value may be more volatile than funds that have greater industry diversification issuers principally engaged in the real estate industry including reits may be subject to risks similar to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate including i changes in general economic and market conditions ii changes in the value of real estate properties iii risks related to local economic conditions overbuilding and increased competition iv increases in property taxes and operating expenses v changes in zoning laws vi casualty and condemnation losses vii variations in rental income    neighborhood values or the appeal of property to tenants viii the availability of financing and ix changes in interest rates and leverage for these reasons the board recommends that shareholders of the fund approve the following as a new fundamental investment policy for the fund the new policy replacing the current policy described above the fund will under normal market conditions invest at least  of the value of its total assets at the time of purchase in the securities of issuers conducting their principal business activities in the real estate industry including obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government any state or territory of the united states or any of their agencies instrumentalities or political subdivisions and investments by any territory of the united states or any of their agencies instrumentalities or political subdivisions for which the underlying collateral is real estate if shareholders approve the new policy for the fund the new policy will take effect shortly after the annual meeting if shareholders do not approve the new policy the fund will continue to operate with its current fundamental investment policy regarding concentration vote required for approval of change to the funds fundamental policy regarding concentration approval of the new policy requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the common shares of the fund represented in person or by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote for the approval of the new policy abstentions and broker nonvotes ie shares held in street name by brokers that indicate on their proxies that they do not have discretionary authority to vote such shares as to the approval of the new policy are counted as present at the annual meeting but assuming the presence of a quorum will have the effect of a vote against the new policy the board including all of the independent trustees unanimously recommends that shareholders vote for the approval of a change to the funds fundamental policy regarding concentration independent registered public accounting firm at a meeting held on december   the funds audit committee approved and the funds board including a majority of the independent trustees ratified the selection of pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc as the funds independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending december   representatives of pwc will not be present

any entity controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the fund that are related to the operations and financial reporting of the fund in some circumstances when certain services were not recognized at the time of the engagement to be nonaudit services the preapproval requirement may be    waived if the aggregate amount of the fees for such nonaudit services constitutes less than five percent of the total amount of revenues paid to pwc by the fund during the fiscal year in which the nonaudit services are provided pwc provided nonaudit services to the adviser during the funds last two fiscal years but these services did not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the fund and therefore were not subject to preapproval pursuant to rule cii of regulation sx pwc did not provide any nonaudit services to any entity controlling controlled by or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing

recommended for investment by all investment companies and private funds participating in a coinvestment transaction exceeds the amount of the actual investment opportunity then the investment

the amount proposed to be invested by each party an investment companys capital available for investment will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand existing commitments and reserves if any the targeted leverage level targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set from time to time by such investment companys board of directors or board of trustees as applicable or imposed by applicable laws rules regulations or interpretations likewise a private funds capital available for investment is determined based on the amount of cash on hand existing commitments and reserves if any the targeted leverage level targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set by the private funds adviser or imposed by applicable laws rules regulations or interpretations any party that desires to make a  followon investment   ie  an additional investment in an existing portfolio company including through the exercise of warrants conversion privileges or other rights to acquire securities of the portfolio company in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired by an investment company in a coinvestment transaction or that desires to sell exchange or otherwise dispose of an investment acquired in a coinvestment transaction will adhere to the conditions contained in this application the coinvestment program requires that the terms conditions price class of securities settlement date and registration rights applicable to any party be the same as those applicable to any investment companys investment with respect to pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  the investment companies may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of such investment company and each other investment company or private fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of directors or board of trustees as applicable of the investment company has approved such investment companys participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the investment company if such board does not so approve any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to    the directors of the investment company who are eligible to vote under section  of the  act the eligible directors  the board of directors or board of trustees as applicable of an investment company may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors of such investment company      reasons for coinvesting it is expected that coinvestment in portfolio companies by the investment companies and the private funds will increase favorable investment opportunities for each participant the coinvestment program will be effected for an investment company only if it is approved by the required majority of such investment companys board of directors or board of trustees as applicable on the basis that it would be advantageous for the investment company to have the additional capital from other investment companies or from the private funds available to meet the funding requirements of attractive investments in portfolio companies registered investment companies and business development companies that make investments of the type contemplated by the investment companies typically limit their participation in any one transaction to a specific dollar amount which may be determined by legal or internally imposed prudential limits on exposure in a single investment in view of the foregoing in cases where an ic adviser identifies investment opportunities requiring larger capital commitments it must seek the participation of other entities with similar investment styles the availability of the other investment companies and the private funds as investing partners of such investment company may alleviate some of that necessity in certain circumstances an investment company could lose some investment opportunities if it is unable to provide onestop financing to a potential portfolio company portfolio companies may reject an offer of funding arranged by an ic adviser due to the applicable investment companys inability to commit the full amount of financing required by the portfolio company in a timely manner  ie  without the delay that typically would be associated with obtaining singletransaction exemptive relief from the commission by reducing the number of occasions on which an investment companys individual or aggregate investment limits require an ic adviser to arrange a syndication with unaffiliated entities such investment company will likely be required to forego fewer suitable investment opportunities with the assets of other investment companies and the private funds available for coinvestment there should be an increase in the number of opportunities accessible to each investment company the ic advisers and the board of directors or board of trustees as applicable of each investment company believe that it would be advantageous for such investment companies to coinvest with the other investment companies and the private funds and that such investments would be consistent with the investment objective investment policies investment position investment strategies investment restrictions regulatory and tax requirements capital available for investment and other pertinent factors applicable to such investment company the ic advisers also believe that coinvestment by the investment companies with the other investment companies and the private funds will afford each investment company the ability to achieve greater diversification and together with the private funds the opportunity to exercise greater influence on the portfolio companies in which the investment companies and the private funds coinvest     b applicable law      sections d a and i of the  act and rule d thereunder section d and section a of the  act make it unlawful for any person

by section a or section b as applicable of the  act the respective ic adviser of each investment company and any other investment company or private fund that it advises could be deemed to be persons related to such investment company in a manner described by section a or section b as applicable and therefore prohibited by section d or section a as applicable and rule d from participating in the

procedures and presumptions for coinvestment transactions to protect the interests of public investors in the registered investment companies and business development company applicants than those described in this application the applicants submit that the formulae and procedures set forth as conditions for the relief requested herein are consistent with the range of investor protection found in the cited orders we note in particular that the coinvestment protocol to be followed by the applicants here is substantially similar to the protocol followed by garrison capital inc and its

company or a company controlled by such registered investment company or business development company is a participant if an application regarding the joint enterprise arrangement or profitsharing plan has been filed with the commission and has been granted by an order issued prior to the submission of such plan or any modification thereof to security holders for approval or prior to its adoption or modification if not so submitted rule db under the  act states that in passing upon applications under such rule the commission shall consider whether the participation by the investment company or controlled company in such joint enterprise joint arrangement or profitsharing plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the  act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants the applicants submit that the fact that the required majority will approve each coinvestment transaction before investment in addition to the other protective conditions set forth in this application will ensure that each investment company will be treated fairly the conditions to which the requested relief will be subject are designed to ensure that the principals of the advisers would not be able to favor one investment company or a private fund over the other investment companies through the allocation of investment opportunities between them because many attractive investment opportunities for an investment company will also be attractive investment opportunities for the other investment companies and the private funds the applicants submit that the coinvestment program presents an attractive alternative to instituting an equitable protocol for the allocation of  of individual investment opportunities to either a single investment company or to the private funds as opportunities arise the applicants submit that each investment companys participation in the coinvestment transactions will be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the  act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of the other investment companies or the private funds other than pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the ic advisers will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the eligible directors of the applicable investment company and the required majority will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by such investment company applicants believe that participation by the investment companies in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the  act and will not be made on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants a formulaic approach such as pro rata dispositions and followon investments eliminates the discretionary ability to make allocation determinations and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching and promotes fairness the applicants note that the commission has adopted a similar pro rata approach in the context of rule c which relates to the redemption by a closedend investment company of less than all of a class of its securities indicating the general fairness and lack of overreaching that such approach provides      g conditions the applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions              each time an adviser considers a potential coinvestment transaction for a private fund or another investment company that falls within an investment companys thencurrent objectives and    see eg the discussion in gladstone capital corp et al application in sec file no  filed on june      strategies the applicable ic adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of such investment for such investment company in light of such investment companys thencurrent circumstances           a         if the applicable ic adviser deems an investment companys participation in any potential coinvestment transaction to be appropriate for such investment company it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for such investment company b         if the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable ic adviser to be invested in such potential coinvestment transaction by an investment company together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating investment companies and private funds collectively in the same transaction exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity then the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participating partys capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated up to the amount proposed to be invested by each party the applicable ic adviser will provide the eligible directors of each participating investment company with information concerning each participating partys available capital to assist the eligible directors with their review of such investment companys investments for compliance with these allocation procedures and c         after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the applicable ic adviser will distribute written information concerning the potential coinvestment transaction including the amount proposed to be invested by each investment company and each private fund to the eligible directors of each participating investment company for their consideration an investment company will coinvest with one or more other investment companies andor private funds only if prior to the investment companys participation in the potential coinvestment transaction the required majority concludes that i         the terms of the potential coinvestment transaction including the consideration to be paid are reasonable and fair to such investment company and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of such investment company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned ii         the potential coinvestment transaction is consistent with a the interests of the stockholders of such investment company and b such investment companys thencurrent objectives and strategies iii         the investment by another investment company or any private fund would not disadvantage such investment company and participation by such investment company would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of any other participant provided that if any other participant but not such investment company itself gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio companys board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company such event will not be interpreted to prohibit the required majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition ciii if a         the eligible directors will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer if any    b         the advisers agree to provide periodic reports to each investment companys board of directors or board of trustees as applicable with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company and c         any fees or other compensation that any other investment company private fund or any affiliated person of another investment company or private fund receives in connection with the right of such other investment company or private fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating investment companies and the participating private funds which each may in turn share their portion with their affiliated persons in accordance with the amount of each partys investment and iv         the proposed investment by the investment company will not benefit the other investment companies the advisers the private funds or any affiliated person of any of them other than the parties to the coinvestment transaction except a to the extent permitted by

or d in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition ciiic              each investment company has the right to decline to participate in any potential coinvestment transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed              the applicable ic adviser will present to the board of directors or the board of trustees as applicable of each investment company for whom it serves as investment adviser on a quarterly basis a record of all investments in potential coinvestment transactions made by any of the other investment companies and the private funds during the preceding quarter that fell within such investment companys thencurrent objectives and strategies that were not made available to such investment company and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to such investment company all information presented to a board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life of such investment company and at least two years thereafter and will be subject to examination by the commission and its staff              except for followon investments made in accordance with condition  an investment company will not invest in reliance on the order in any issuer in which any other investment company private fund or any affiliated person of another investment company or private fund is an existing investor              an investment company will not participate in any potential coinvestment transaction unless the terms conditions price class of securities to be purchased settlement date and registration rights will be the same for each participating investment company and private fund the grant to another participant but not such investment company of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio companys board of directors the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate

acquired in a coinvestment transaction the applicable ic adviser for each investment company that participated in the coinvestment transaction will i         notify such investment company of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time and ii         formulate a recommendation as to participation by such investment company in any such disposition b         each investment company will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to any other participants c         an

written recommendation as to an investment companys participation to the eligible directors of such investment company and the investment company will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that the required majority determines that it is in the investment companys best interests d         each investment company and each other participant will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition          a        if any other participant desires to make a followon investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a coinvestment transaction each ic

written recommendation as to such investment companys participation to the eligible directors and such investment company will participate in such followon investment solely to the extent that the required majority determines that it is in such investment companys best interests    c         if with respect to any followon investment i         the amount of the opportunity is not based on the investment companies and the private funds outstanding investments immediately preceding the followon investment and ii         the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable ic adviser to be invested by each investment company in the followon investment together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participants in the same transaction exceeds the amount of the opportunity
