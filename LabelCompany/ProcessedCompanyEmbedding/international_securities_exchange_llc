act of  “exchange act” or “act”  and rule b thereunder a proposed rule change to list and trade options on the ise max spy index “ise max spy” the proposed rule change was published for comment in the federal register on march   the commission received three comment letters on the proposed rule change on may   the commission extended the time period for commission action to june   on may   ise submitted a response to the comment letters  and filed amendment no  to the proposed rule change the commission subsequently received three additional comment letters  and a second response letter from ise all the comment letters received including ises response letters are available on the commissions web site this order institutes proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change as modified by amendment no  institution of these proceedings however does not indicate that the commission has reached any conclusions with respect to the proposed rule change nor does it mean that the commission will ultimately disapprove the proposed rule change rather as addressed below the commission desires to solicit additional input from interested parties on the issues presented by the proposed rule change ii description of the proposal as set forth in more detail in the notice ise proposes to list and trade options including longterm options on the ise max spy index which is “designed to represent  times the value of the published share prices in the spdr sp  etf “spy” trust”  options on the ise max spy index would be europeanstyle and pm cashsettled and they would be quoted and traded in us dollars according to ise the realtime value of the ise max spy index is calculated by multiplying the share prices of spy by a factor of ten and rounding to the tenth place this value would be calculated by ise or its agent and would be disseminated by ise every  seconds during its regular trading hours to market information vendors via the options price reporting authority ise proposes to calculate the settlement value for options on the ise max spy index using the net asset value “nav” of the fund as calculated by ise on a per share basis times ten ise states that the method it will use for calculating the nav of spy is the same method that is used industrywide for calculating the nav of an exchange traded fund “etf” with equityonly holdings and is the pershare dollar amount of the fund which is calculated by dividing the total value of all the securities in its portfolio less any liabilities by the number of fund shares outstanding ise also states that the settlement value that it calculates may be different from the nav published by the trustee of the spy trust in calculating the settlement value for options on the ise max spy index ise states that it would use the published closing prices from the primary market of the spy trusts portfolio securities as proposed exchange rules that are applicable to the trading of options on broadbased indexes would apply to the trading of options on the ise max spy index specifically the trading of options on the ise max spy index would be subject to among others exchange rules governing margin requirements and trading halt procedures for index options the trading of options on the ise max spy index also would be subject to the exchanges customer protection rules ise proposes that options on the ise max spy index be approved on a pilot basis for an initial period of  months ise states that if it were to propose an extension of the program or propose to make the program permanent then it would submit a filing proposing such amendments to the program ise notes that any positions established under the pilot would not be impacted by the expiration of the pilot as part of the pilot program ise would submit a pilot program report to the commission at least two months prior to the expiration date of the program “annual report” the annual report would contain an analysis of volume open interest and trading patterns the analysis would examine trading in the proposed option product as well as trading in the securities that comprise the sp  index in addition for series that exceed certain minimum open interest parameters the annual report would provide analysis of index price volatility and share trading activity in addition to the annual report ise committed to provide the commission with periodic interim reports while the pilot is in effect that would contain some but not all of the information contained in the annual report in its filing ise notes that it would provide the annual and interim reports to the commission on a confidential basis comment letters as noted above the commission received six comment letters and two ise response letters on the proposed rule change one commenter expresses support for the proposed rule change and states that it “generally applauds efforts to provide investors with additional opportunities to invest using listed options”  in particular this commenter supports ises proposal to allow pm settlement for options on the ise max spy index this commenter also supports the proposal to impose no position limits for options on the ise max spy index this commenter states that a key part of its basis for agreeing with the proposed position limits is the fact that “there is a very large degree of economic equivalence between options on ises proposed index and the existing c spxpm product”  two commenters oppose the proposed rule change for the reasons discussed below a pending litigation potential for market disruption and harm to investors two commenters argue that the proposed options are in fact options on the sp  index and therefore would violate a permanent injunction entered by the illinois state court in  “injunction” these two commenters have filed a motion to enforce this injunction against ise in illinois circuit court and request that the commission disapprove the proposed rule change  or not take action to approve the proposed rule change until the litigation is resolved in a second comment letter cboe argues that the commission should disapprove the proposed options because they could not legally be traded in addition cboe requests that if the commission considers the proposed rule change prior to judicial action on the motion the commission should make clear that any approval is solely concerned with whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the act and that the illinois state court has full and independent authority to resolve the issues that arise under state law in its response letter ise states that it is opposing the motion to enforce the injunction ise objects to the commenters request that the commission delay approval of the proposed rule change until the illinois court decides on the motion referring to prior commission action where the commission indicated that its decision to approve a rule filing should be based solely on whether it complies with the act without regard to any state law issues ise states that because the current illinois proceedings involve issues of intellectual property law and state procedure the commission should approve this proposed rule change without regard to the illinois proceedings according to the two commenters significant market disruption and harm to investors could occur if the commission were to approve the proposed rule change prior to the illinois court ruling on whether the proposed options violate the existing injunction or are otherwise unlawful specifically these commenters express the concern that if ise commences trading in the proposed options before a decision by the illinois court where the court finds that such trading is unlawful investors would have no readily available means to trade out of or exercise their positions in the proposed options in its first response letter ise disagrees with the comment that the commissions approval of the proposed rule change before the illinois courts ruling on the motion could result in significant market disruption or harm to investors nevertheless ise represents that absent returning to the commission and seeking explicit approval to do so it will not commence trading options on the ise max spy index until the illinois circuit court has ruled on the motion in a second comment letter cboe reiterates its concerns regarding potential market disruption and harm to investors in response to ises letter cboe states that the illinois lower courts ruling on the motion to enforce the injunction may not be the end of the litigation over whether the proposed options may be validly traded under state law and that the commission should condition any approval on ises undertaking not to commence trading until all judicial challenges to the lawfulness of the proposed options under state law have been resolved in its second response letter ise again represents that it will not launch the proposed options for trading unless and until the illinois circuit court denies the motion to enforce the injunction in addition in the event that the illinois circuit court were to deny the motion to enforce the injunction and such a decision was to be subsequently reversed and ise were to be enjoined from offering the proposed options after it had commenced trading and there is open interest ise represents that it would seek to have the state court permit it to continue to offer a market for closingonly transactions for so long as it takes all open interest to wind down in an orderly manner ise states that it has systems rules and procedures in place that would permit such a closingonly orderly wind down and that it is “inconceivable that the court would refuse to permit such a closingonly market”  ise further states that even if the court were to deny a closingonly market there are adequate rules and procedures in place at the exchange and the clearing level to allow for an orderly wind down of any open interest in addition ise represents that it will insert a litigation risk discussion into the options disclosure document “odd” which will be substantially similar to the litigation risk language included in prior versions of the odd with respect to index participation products finally ise states that these investor protection risks are not unique to the proposed product and that there have been multiple cases where a market becomes unavailable for the continued trading of a product in which there is open interest b potential for investor confusion  characterization of the product as options on the ise max spy index one commenter asserts that ises description of the proposed options is inaccurate and misleading this commenter understands from the filing that the settlement value for options on the ise max spy index would be calculated differently from all other values of the ise max spy index stating that “the settlement value will be calculated by reference to the stocks in the sp  index as weighted by sp in its sp  index”  this commenter argues that the benchmark for the proposed option is not spy because the proposed options are not actually settled by reference to spy this commenter subsequently asserts that the proposed rule change “misleads investors by falsely characterizing the proposed options as options on the ise max spy index”  specifically this commenter states that ise has admitted that the proposed options would not be settled based on the value of spy and has failed to set forth any way in which the settlement value for the proposed options would have any relation to the ise max spy index this commenter also asserts that the proposed rule change misleads investors by characterizing the proposed option as a broadbased index option when the ise max spy index actually consists of only a single component security in response ise states that the rule filing makes clear that the ise max spy index is calculated based on the traded prices of spy shares and that the options on the ise max spy index are settled on the basis of a calculation of the nav of the spy trusts assets further to ensure that investors have an ongoing means to access information about options on the ise max spy index ise represents in its second response letter that it will i work with the occ to amend the odd to provide a clear and unambiguous description of the product and any unique risks associated with it ii display the contract specifications on its web site iii create a special web page devoted exclusively to the proposed options which will describe in plain english all the terms of this product including index calculation and settlement and iv follow the same marketing process it follows for all of its other new products which is designed to promote awareness and a clear understanding of the product further according to one commenter to the extent that the “ise max spy index” is “indexlike” it is only because the spy trust holds all of the stocks in the sp  index weighted as the stocks in the sp  index are weighted this commenter argues that even if the benchmark could be said to have reference to spy the benchmark would have only one component security and therefore would not be an index ise states in response that an index with one component is still an index and refers to cboes micro narrowbased index options and cboes indexes that measure the spot yield of individual us treasury securities by simply multiplying them by ten ie tnx in its second letter cboe states that consistent with section  of the act  and the principles set forth in commissions staff legal bulletin micro narrowbased indexes may consist of no fewer than two securities and no more than nine securities cboe also states that its micro narrowbased index option rule applies only to an underlying benchmark that is itself a security index with respect to ises reference to cboes indexes that measure the spot yield of individual us treasury securities cboe states that “tnx options were not security index options but instead were interest rate options based on interest rate values that were indexed to make the options contracts a suitable size”  cboe further states that tnx options were regulated as interest rate options and were described for all purposes as interest rate options in response ise states that there is no legal requirement that an index consists of more than one component ise disagrees with the commenters rationale that indexes must contain at least two components and states that the commenter is “backpedaling on its own past history of creating onecomponent indexes”   clarity and completeness of the description of the options on the ise max spy index i method for calculating settlement values one commenter states that ise is unclear in describing the assets that it would take into account in calculating the settlement value of the proposed options and points out the differences between ises calculation of the nav of spy as described in the notice and the trusts calculation of the nav of spy in particular this commenter points out that ise omitted the reference to “other assets” of the trust in the description of its calculation methodology the commenter states that if ise does not take the “other assets” held in the trust into account in calculating settlement values for the proposed options its settlement value calculation methodology will “clearly diverge from the method used by the trustee for the trust to calculate navs for the trust”  the commenter states that if this is ises intent it needs to be clearly stated in the filing in its response letter ise states that the ise max spy index “is settled by reference to the value of the spy etf” and that it is independently calculating the nav of the spy etf using a methodology that closely tracks the methodology that state street global advisors “ssga” uses to calculate the nav of the spy etf ise states that generally the nav for equitybased etfs is calculated in the same manner regardless of who the calculation agent is ise further explains that nav is determined by adding the value of the portfolio securities to the trusts net cash accrued dividends minus accrued fees and expenses and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding shares of the fund ise states that the net cash amount is usually determined by the funds administrator who provides that information to the national securities clearing corporation “nscc” in a second comment letter cboe reiterates that ise fails to explain the differences between its calculation of the nav and the nav published by the trustee of the trust cboe states that ises proposal did not make clear that the settlement of the proposed options is based on a calculation of the nav of the spy etf and that the proposal misleads investors about how ise would calculate the settlement value cboe notes that “ise states that the nav calculation of an etf generally is determined by adding the trusts net cash accrued dividends minus accrued fees and expenses to the value of the portfolio securities” thereby implying that it would do so as well when computing the settlement value of the proposed options cboe states however that “ise is careful never to actually state—either in the ise proposal or ise response letter i—that it would use dividends and trust expenses when calculating the settlement value of the proposed options”  cboe further points out that ise may not be able to include those factors in its calculation because the trust disseminates information about the spy etfs net cash at the same time as the information about the value of its stock holdings in a second response letter ise specifically sets forth the formula for settlement value calculation including the formula for calculating the nav of spy ise states that its nav calculating method is the same standard method that is used industrywide for etfs with equityonly holdings specifically ise explains that after the close of each trading day the funds administrator provides to the nscc the portfolio securities of the fund the number of shares of each security the net cash of the fund and the shares outstanding of the fund the nscc makes this information available to market participants on a daily basis after the close of each trading day ise states that by way of its market data vendor it will calculate the settlement value using the data received from the nscc ii source of prices used in calculating settlement values one commenter states that ise is unclear in describing the sources of the prices that it would use in calculating settlement values for the proposed options and that ises representation of the trusts nav calculation is inconsistent with the prospectus in its response letter ise states that the filing clearly identifies the source of the prices—the published closing prices from the primary market of the securities ise also disagrees with the comment that its representation is inconsistent with the spdr prospectus because the trust may independently decide which exchange it deems to be the “primary market” as a source for closing prices in a second response letter ise again states that its calculation of the nav would be based upon the closing prices from the primary markets of each portfolio security and that it recognizes that the spy trust may use different prices because the trustee reserves the right to evaluate portfolio securities independently of closing sale prices if it deems such prices to be “inappropriate”  iii differences between settlement value and all other values one commenter states that ises filing “does not contain any explanation of why it proposes to calculate settlement values of the proposed benchmark differently from all other values of the proposed benchmark”  in its response letter ise explains that it is doing so to decrease the opportunity for manipulation and other abusive trading practices specifically ise states that a wouldbe manipulator would need to manipulate the closing price of  individual stocks as opposed to the closing price of one etf ise also states that its calculation of the nav would allow for a timely settlement of the proposed options specifically ise states that the obligation of ssga is to establish a nav of the spy etf before the next days opening however since the occ requires settlement values to be sent to it the same day as the settlement of an option ise cannot rely on the ssgapublished nav further ise points out that “the concept of utilizing a reference price to settle an index option product that differs from the values of the proposed benchmark is not novel and is best illustrated in cboes amsettled sp  index “spx” options”  in response cboe differentiates the settlement of spx options from the settlement of ise max spy options specifically cboe states that soq  represents a modified calculation of the same interest that underlies spx options during their life—the sp  index conversely cboe states that ise would use a different underlying benchmark to calculate the settlement value of the proposed options—the benchmark during the life of the proposed options would be the ise max spy index based on the traded prices of spy whereas the benchmark at settlement would be a recalculated sp  index iv special dividends and special distributions one commenter states that companies in the sp  index from time to time pay special dividends and make special distributions to their shareholders and ise did not explain whether or how the relationship between settlement value and other values would be preserved in such a circumstance in its response letter ise states that it has never been a practice of the exchanges to describe the details on dividend processing for components of indexes in rule filings seeking approval of index options further ise states that because the proposed product is an index option it does not anticipate adjustments being made to the options as a result of any component dividends and that this is customary practice for index options  odd amendments one commenter suggests that the odd would require supplementation before the proposed options could be listed and traded first this commenter states that an investor looking for disclosure with respect to the proposed product might be uncertain as to whether they are described in chapter iii options on equity securities or chapter iv index options of the odd second this commenter states that the odd would need to be supplemented to provide disclosure with respect to the difference between the calculation of the settlement value and all other values of the proposed options in its response letter ise states that it will follow the wellsettled process for supplementing the odd to devise disclosure of any risks associated with the proposed options that are determined by the listed options disclosure committee “lodc”  to be necessary for disclosure further as discussed above in its second response letter ise represents that it will work with the occ to amend the odd to provide a clear and unambiguous description of the proposed options and any unique risks associated with it iv proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove srise as modified by amendment no  and grounds for disapproval under consideration the commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to section b of the act to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved institution of such proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change institution of disapproval proceedings does not indicate that the commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved rather as described in greater detail below the commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide additional comment on the proposed rule change to inform the commissions analysis of whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change as discussed above the proposed rule change would allow ise to list and trade europeanstyle pm and cash settled options on the ise max spy index the proposed options would not be subject to position limits the realtime value of the ise max spy index would be calculated by multiplying the share prices of spy by a factor of ten and rounding to the tenth place whereas the settlement value of the option would be based on the nav of spy as calculated by ise on a per share basis times ten the section of the act applicable to the proposed rule change that provides the grounds for the disapproval or approval under consideration is section b which requires that the rules of an exchange be designed among other things to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices to promote just and equitable principles of trade to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest as discussed above one commenter supports the proposed rule change while two commenters oppose the proposed rule change commenters raise the concern that the proposed rule change could lead to significant market disruption and harm to investors if ise commences trading in the proposed options before all judicial challenges to the lawfulness of the proposed options under state law have been resolved in addition commenters raise concerns regarding whether the proposed new product could be misleading to investors and questioned the accuracy and clarity of ises description of the proposed options including the calculation of the settlement value the differences between the calculation of the settlement value and all other values of the ise max spy index and the characterization of the proposed options as options on the “ise max spy index”  in light of the concerns raised by commenters the commission believes that questions remain as to whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of section b of the act including whether the proposed options are designed to protect investors and the public interest v procedure request for written comments the commission requests that interested persons provide written submissions of their views data and arguments with respect to the issues identified above as well as any others they may have identified with the proposal in particular the commission invites the written views of interested persons concerning whether the proposed rule change is consistent with section b or any other provision of the act or the rules and regulations thereunder although there do not appear to be any issues relevant to approval or disapproval which would be facilitated by an oral presentation of views data and arguments the commission will consider pursuant to rule b any request for an opportunity to make an oral presentation interested persons are invited to submit written data views and arguments regarding whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved by august   any person who wishes to file a rebuttal to any other persons submission must file that rebuttal by august   the commission is asking that commenters address the merit of ises statements in support of the proposal in addition to any other comments they may wish to submit about the proposed rule change specifically the commission is requesting comment on the following what are commenters views as to whether market disruption and harm to investors would occur if the commission were to approve the proposed rule change before all judicial challenges to the lawfulness of the proposed options under state law have been resolved in light of the exchanges representation that it would not start trading the proposed options until the illinois circuit court rules on the motion to enforce the injunction and its representation regarding the potential mechanisms to ensure an orderly wind down of trading in the event that ise is enjoined from offering the product after trading has already begun do commenters believe any harm would result if the exchange started trading the proposed options before all judicial challenges to the lawfulness of the proposed options under state law have been resolved why or why not as outlined above the exchange has provided additional detail about how it intends to calculate the settlement value for options on the ise max spy index what are commenters views as to whether the exchange should provide additional clarity in the filing regarding the calculation methodology for the settlement value of options on the ise max spy index to mitigate concerns regarding the potential for investor confusion please be specific in your response as noted above the exchange would calculate the value of the ise max spy index by reference to the traded prices of spy times ten at all times however the settlement value of the options on the ise max spy index would be calculated by reference to the nav of spy as calculated by the exchange on a per share basis times ten what are commenters views of the impact if any of the differences between the calculation of the settlement value of the proposed options and the value of the ise max spy index itself on investor understanding of the options on the ise max spy index do commenters believe that the differences between the calculation of the settlement value of the proposed options and the value of the ise max spy index itself could cause investor confusion please explain why or why not if commenters believe that the differences between the calculation of the settlement value of the proposed options and the value of the ise max spy index itself could cause investor confusion what are commenters views as to whether the steps that ise has proposed to take to provide investors with information about the product  would be sufficient to mitigate such concerns do commenters believe that the characterization of the proposed options as options on the “ise max spy index” would have the potential to cause investor confusion if so why if not why not if so what are commenters views on whether any potential confusion would be sufficiently mitigated by the steps that ise has proposed to take to provide investors with information about the product  please be specific in your response comments may be submitted by any of the

states that it also would disseminate these values to its members back to citation   see notice supra note  and ise response letter ii supra note  at  in its second response letter ise sets forth its formula for calculating the index settlement value isettt  navspyt × m see ise response letter ii supra note  at  in this formula “isettt” is the ise max spy settlement value at time t “navspyt” is the nav per share of the spy trust at time t as calculated by ise and “m” is the constant multiplier of  see id ise also provides the formula for calculating navspyt navspyt  σnipi × si  cash ×  − feeshares outstanding see id in this formula “n” is the number of stocks held by the trust “pi” is the closing price of each stock held by the trust “si” is the number of shares of each stock held by the trust “cash” is the cash held in the trust “fee” is the stated fee for the trust and “shares outstanding” is the number of trust shares outstanding see id ise also states that “the net cash amount is determined by adding the accrued dividends of the portfolio securities since the funds last distribution minus the accrued fees which are essentially the annual management fees prorated per day” see id at  back to citation   ise explains in its response letters that this difference may result because the trust may independently decide which exchange it deems to be the “primary market” as a

notice is hereby given that on march   miami international securities exchange llc “miax” or “exchange” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” a proposed rule change as described in items i ii and iii below which items have been prepared by the exchange the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange is filing a proposal to amend the miax options fee schedule the “fee schedule” to establish fees applicable to distributors described below of the top of miax “tom” market data product a direct data feed that features the exchanges best bid and offer with aggregate size and last sale information on the miax system while changes to the fee schedule pursuant to this proposal are effective upon filing the exchange has designated these changes to be operative on april   the text of the proposed rule change is provided in exhibit  the text of the proposed rule change is also available on the exchanges web site at httpwwwmiaxoptionscom​filter​wotitle​rule​filing at miaxs principal office and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant aspects of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish fees for distributors of tom tom provides distributors with a direct data feed that includes the exchanges best bid and offer with aggregate size and last sale information based on displayable order and quoting interest on the exchange the tom data feed includes data that is identical to the data sent to the processor for the options price regulatory authority “opra” the tom and opra data leave the miax system at the same time as required under section ciiib of the limited liability company agreement of the options price reporting authority llc the “opra plan” which prohibits the dissemination of proprietary information on any more timely basis than the same information is furnished to the opra system for inclusion in opras consolidated dissemination of options information start printed page  monthly fees for tom the exchange proposes to charge monthly fees to distributors of the tom market data product the fee schedule will reflect that a “distributor” of tom data is any entity that receives a feed of tom data either directly from miax or indirectly through another entity and then distributes it either internally within that entity or externally outside that entity and that all distributors would be required to execute a miax distributor agreement the monthly distributor fee charged will depend on whether the distributor is an “internal distributor” or an “external distributor” as defined below internal distributor an internal distributor is an organization that subscribes to the exchange for the use of tom and is permitted by agreement with the exchange to provide tom data to internal users ie users within their own organization internal distributors would be charged a monthly fee of  per organization external distributor an external distributor is an organization that subscribes to the exchange for the use of tom and is permitted by agreement with the exchange to provide tom data to both internal users and to external users ie users outside of their own organization external distributors will be charged a monthly fee of  per organization market data fees for tom will be reduced for new distributors for the first month during which they subscribe to tom based on the number of trading days that have been held during such month as of the date on which they subscribe such new distributors will be assessed a prorata percentage of the fees described above which is the percentage of the number of trading days remaining in the affected calendar month as of the date on which they begin to receive the tom feed divided by the total number of trading days in the affected calendar month in addition to miaxs best bid and offer with aggregate size and last sale information distributors that subscribe to tom will also receive opening imbalance condition information opening routing information expanded quote range  information as provided in miax rule f posthalt notification as provided in miax rule d and liquidity refresh condition information as provided in miax rule ciiia this additional information the “administrative information” is included in the tom feed as secondary information the administrative information is also currently available to miax market makers via connectivity with the miax express interface “mei” for which they are assessed connectivity fees in order to accommodate those who wish to receive the administrative information but who do not wish to subscribe to the tom product the exchange submitted a separate proposed rule change concurrently with the instant proposed rule change to establish a new category of miax participant an administrative information subscriber “ais” to make the administrative information available to ais via ais port connectivity with miax and to establish testing connectivity and ais port fees for such participants who wish only to receive the administrative information via connectivity with the miax system  statutory basis miax believes that its proposal to amend its fee schedule is consistent with the provisions of section  of the act in general and with section b of the act in particular in that it provides an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among distributors of tom because all distributors in each of the respective category of distributor ie internal and external will be assessed the same fees as other distributors in their category in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers who do not need the data beyond the prices sizes market center identifications of the nbbo and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive and pay for such data when brokerdealers may choose to receive and pay for additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data by removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data regulation nms advanced the goals of the act and the principles reflected in its legislative history if the free market should determine whether proprietary data is sold to brokerdealers at all it follows that the price at which such data is sold should be set by the market as well in july  congress adopted hr  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  “doddfrank act” which amended section  of the act among other things section  of the doddfrank act amended paragraph a of section b of the act by inserting the phrase “on any person whether or not the person is a member of the selfregulatory organization” after “due fee or other charge imposed by the selfregulatory organization” as a result all sro rule proposals establishing or changing dues fees or other charges are immediately effective upon filing regardless of whether such dues fees or other charges are imposed on members of the sro nonmembers or both section  further amended paragraph c of section b of the act to read in pertinent part “at any time within the day period beginning on the date of filing of such a proposed rule change in accordance with the provisions of paragraph  of section b the commission summarily may temporarily suspend the change in the rules of the selfregulatory organization made thereby if it appears to the commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the protection of investors or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title if the commission start printed page takes such action the commission shall institute proceedings under paragraph b of section b to determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved” the exchange believes that these amendments to section  of the act reflect congresss intent to allow the commission to rely upon the forces of competition to ensure that fees for market data are reasonable and equitably allocated although section b had formerly authorized immediate effectiveness for a “due fee or other charge imposed by the selfregulatory organization” the commission adopted a policy and subsequently a rule stating that fees for data and other products available to persons that are not members of the selfregulatory organization must be approved by the commission after first being published for comment at the time the commission supported the adoption of the policy and the rule by pointing out that unlike members whose representation in selfregulatory organization governance was mandated by the act nonmembers should be given the opportunity to comment on fees before being required to pay them and that the commission should specifically approve all such fees miax believes that the amendment to section  reflects congresss conclusion that the evolution of selfregulatory organization governance and competitive market structure have rendered the commissions prior policy on nonmember fees obsolete specifically many exchanges have evolved from memberowned notforprofit corporations into forprofit investorowned corporations or subsidiaries of investorowned corporations accordingly exchanges no longer have narrow incentives to manage their affairs for the exclusive benefit of their members but rather have incentives to maximize the appeal of their products to all customers whether members or nonmembers so as to broaden distribution and grow revenues moreover the exchange believes that the change also reflects an endorsement of the commissions determinations that reliance on competitive markets is an appropriate means to ensure equitable and reasonable prices simply put the change reflects a presumption that all fee changes should be permitted to take effect immediately since the level of all fees are constrained by competitive forces the exchange therefore believes that the fees for tom are properly assessed on nonmember distributors the decision of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in netcoaliton v sec no  dc cir  although reviewing a commission decision made prior to the effective date of the doddfrank act upheld the commissions reliance upon competitive markets to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for market data in fact the legislative history indicates that the congress intended that the market system “evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed” and that the sec wield its regulatory power “in those situations where competition may not be sufficient” such as in the creation of a “consolidated transactional reporting system”  the courts conclusions about congressional intent are therefore reinforced by the doddfrank act amendments which create a presumption that exchange fees including market data fees may take effect immediately without prior commission approval and that the commission should take action to suspend a fee change and institute a proceeding to determine whether the fee change should be approved or disapproved only where the commission has concerns that the change may not be consistent with the act miax believes that the proposed fee is fair and equitable in accordance with section b of the act and not unreasonably discriminatory in accordance with section b of the act as described above the proposed fee is based on pricing that exists in the fee schedules of other exchanges moreover the decision as to whether or not to subscribe to tom is entirely optional to all parties potential subscribers are not required to purchase the tom market data feed and miax is not required to make the tom market data feed available subscribers can discontinue their use at any time and for any reason including due to their assessment of the reasonableness of fees charged the allocation of fees among subscribers is fair and reasonable because if the market deems the proposed fees to be unfair or inequitable firms can diminish or discontinue their use of this data b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act notwithstanding its determination that the commission may rely upon competition to establish fair and equitably allocated fees for market data the netcoalition court found that the commission had not in that case compiled a record that adequately supported its conclusion that the market for the data at issue in the case was competitive miax believes that a record may readily be established to demonstrate the competitive nature of the market in question there is intense competition between trading platforms that provide transaction execution and routing services and proprietary data products transaction execution and proprietary data products are complementary in that market data is both an input and a byproduct of the execution service in fact market data and trade execution are a representative example of joint products with joint costs the decision whether and on which platform to post an order will depend on the attributes of the platform where the order can be posted including the execution fees data quality and price and distribution of its data products without the prospect of a taking order seeing and reacting to a posted order on a particular platform the posting of the order would accomplish little without trade executions exchange data products cannot exist data products are valuable to many end subscribers only insofar as they provide information that end subscribers expect will assist them or their customers in making trading decisions the costs of producing market data include not only the costs of the data distribution infrastructure but also the costs of designing maintaining and operating the exchanges transaction execution platform and the cost of regulating the exchange to ensure its fair operation and maintain investor confidence the total return that a trading platform earns reflects the revenues it receives from both products and the joint costs it incurs moreover an exchanges customers view the costs of transaction executions and of data as a unified cost of doing business with the exchange a brokerdealer will direct orders to a particular exchange only if the expected revenues from executing trades on the exchange exceed net transaction execution costs and the cost of data that the brokerdealer chooses to buy to support its trading decisions or those of its customers the choice of data products is in turn a product of the value of the products in making profitable trading decisions if the cost of the product exceeds its expected start printed page value the brokerdealer will choose not to buy it moreover as a brokerdealer chooses to direct fewer orders to a particular exchange the value of the product to the brokerdealer decreases for two reasons first the product will contain less information because executions of the brokerdealers orders will not be reflected in it second and perhaps more important the product will be less valuable to that brokerdealer because it does not provide information about the venue to which it is directing its orders data from the competing venue to which the brokerdealer is directing orders will become correspondingly more valuable thus a supercompetitive increase in the fees charged for either transactions or data has the potential to impair revenues from both products “no one disputes that competition for order flow is fierce”  however the existence of fierce competition for order flow implies a high degree of price sensitivity on the part of brokerdealers with order flow since they may readily reduce costs by directing orders toward the lowestcost trading venues a brokerdealer that shifted its order flow from one platform to another in response to order execution price differentials would both reduce the value of that platforms market data and reduce its own need to consume data from the disfavored platform similarly if a platform increases its market data fees the change will affect the overall cost of doing business with the platform and affected brokerdealers will assess whether they can lower their trading costs by directing orders elsewhere and thereby lessening the need for the more expensive data analyzing the cost of market data distribution in isolation from the cost of all of the inputs supporting the creation of market data will inevitably underestimate the cost of the data thus because it is impossible to create data without a fast technologically robust and wellregulated execution system system costs and regulatory costs affect the price of market data it would be equally misleading however to attribute all of the exchanges costs to the market data portion of an exchanges joint product rather all of the exchanges costs are incurred for the unified purposes of attracting order flow executing andor routing orders and generating and selling data about market activity the total return that an exchange earns reflects the revenues it receives from the joint products and the total costs of the joint products competition among trading platforms can be expected to constrain the aggregate return each platform earns from the sale of its joint products but different platforms may choose from a range of possible and equally reasonable pricing strategies as the means of recovering total costs for example some platforms may choose to pay rebates to attract orders charge relatively low prices for market information or provide information free of charge and charge relatively high prices for accessing posted liquidity other platforms may choose a strategy of paying lower rebates or no rebates to attract orders setting relatively high prices for market information and setting relatively low prices for accessing posted liquidity in this environment there is no economic basis for regulating maximum prices for one of the joint products in an industry in which suppliers face competitive constraints with regard to the joint offering this would be akin to strictly regulating the price that an automobile manufacturer can charge for car sound systems despite the existence of a highly competitive market for cars and the availability of aftermarket alternatives to the manufacturersupplied system the market for market data products is competitive and inherently contestable because there is fierce competition for the inputs necessary to the creation of proprietary data and strict pricing discipline for the proprietary products themselves numerous exchanges compete with each other for listings trades and market data itself providing virtually limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs who wish to produce and distribute their own market data this proprietary data is produced by each individual exchange as well as other entities in a vigorously competitive market brokerdealers currently have numerous alternative venues for their order flow including eleven existing options markets each sro market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions competitive markets for order flow executions and transaction reports provide pricing discipline for the inputs of proprietary data products the large number of sros that currently produce proprietary data or are currently capable of producing it provides further pricing discipline for proprietary data products each sro is currently permitted to produce proprietary data products and many in addition to miax currently do including nasdaq cboe ise nyse amex and nysearca additionally order routers and market data vendors can facilitate single or multiple brokerdealers production of proprietary data products the potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless market data vendors provide another form of price discipline for proprietary data products because they control the primary means of access to end subscribers vendors impose price restraints based upon their business models for example vendors such as bloomberg and thomson reuters that assess a surcharge on data they sell may refuse to offer proprietary products that end subscribers will not purchase in sufficient numbers internet portals such as google impose a discipline by providing only data that will enable them to attract “eyeballs” that contribute to their advertising revenue retail brokerdealers such as schwab and fidelity offer their customers proprietary data only if it promotes trading and generates sufficient commission revenue although the business models may differ these vendors pricing discipline is the same they can simply refuse to purchase any proprietary data product that fails to provide sufficient value miax and other producers of proprietary data products must understand and respond to these varying business models and pricing disciplines in order to market proprietary data products successfully in addition to the competition and price discipline described above the market for proprietary data products is also highly contestable because market entry is rapid inexpensive and profitable the history of electronic trading is replete with examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers archipelago bats trading and direct edge regulation nms by deregulating the market for proprietary data has increased the contestability of that market while brokerdealers have previously published their proprietary data individually regulation nms encourages market data vendors and brokerdealers to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible multiple market data vendors already have the capability to aggregate data and disseminate it on a profitable scale including bloomberg and thomson reuters the court in netcoalition concluded that the commission had failed to demonstrate that the market for market data was competitive based on the reasoning of the commissions netcoalition order because in the courts view the commission had not adequately demonstrated that the proprietary data at issue in the case is start printed page used to attract order flow miax believes however that evidence not then before the court clearly demonstrates that availability of data attracts order flow due to competition among platforms miax intends to improve its platform data offerings on a continuing basis and to respond promptly to customers data needs the intensity of competition for proprietary information is significant and miax believes that this proposal itself clearly evidences such competition miax is offering tom in order to keep pace with changes in the industry and evolving customer needs it is entirely optional and is geared towards attracting new member applicants and customers miax competitors continue to create new market data products and innovative pricing in this space miax expects to see firms challenge its pricing on the basis of miaxs explicit fees being
