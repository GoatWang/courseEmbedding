light amid clouds over sac january     stephen taub the redwood city califspinoff led by ryan frick and oliver evans reports it more than tripled assets in  let’s face it when you think of former sac capital executives you think of the individuals who have been charged with insider trading and other illegal acts at the beleaguered wall street hedge fund of the numerous hedge funds that steve cohen’s sac capital advisors has spawned however dorsal capital management is one that has turned adversity into opportunity—even success in  the redwood city califbased firm founded by ryan frick and oliver evans in september  more than tripled assets to about  million prompting the firm to close the fund to new investors dorsal has mostly run under the radar but in its yearend letter to clients the firm said the fund may reopen sometime this year it has begun to study the possibility of a capitalraise for later in  the letter says dorsal launched its dorsal capital partners fund with about  million in assets under management besides frick and evans the two other partners are jeff barnett who joined in june  as chief financial officer and youli petkov who came onboard the following month and was promoted to partner in  the fund focused on equity longshort concentrates on technology and consumer companies returns were up  percent in  since its september  inception it has surged  percent in aggregate more or less in line with the sp  dorsal is known for its cautious approach to risk management for example its sharpe ratio a tricky measurement of riskadjusted returns is  considered very good the firm is your classic bottomup longshort stock picker in the fourth quarter its gross exposure ranged from  percent to  percent while net exposure ranged from  percent to  percent at the end of the year it had  short positions compared with just  long positions the tight range…underlies our strategy of relying on stockpicking to generate alpha and absolute returns as opposed to trying to time the market the firm states in its yearend letter dorsal points out that in  its longs contributed  percent to gross returns while shorts cost it  percent of its return given our average long and short exposure ranges those contributions represent significantly positive and very balanced alpha generation on both sides of the book it states in the letter the fund’s gains last year were driven by the semiconductor and internet sectors in the fourth quarter dorsal sold its entire long position in microsoft corp and covered about half of its short position in intel corp looking ahead dorsal says it wants to increase its volatility bets with plans to raise gross exposure above  percent after the fourthquarter earnings season winds down however it stresses it will not deviate much from its net exposure it also may move the portfolio to more concentrated levels the fund says this could lead to larger drawdowns—peak to trough declines—and more down months but dorsal is confident it could do this without sacrificing its sharpe ratio at present based on its bottomup analysis the fund is slightly netlong internet stocks and slightly netshort what it calls saas or software as a service in general its bias is toward companies with clean balance sheets and big net cash positions we believe that many technology companies are currently getting no credit for their cash dorsal says possible catalysts for unlocking this cash congress passes a law that would incentivize companies to bring offshore cash back to the us or some companies use the cash to boost shareholder value either way dorsal indicates these are the kinds of companies it would find interesting overall it says investors will ultimately be rewarded for holding companies that grow earnings significantly cycleovercycle and trade at reasonable valuations while being short companies that will see earnings disappointments cycleovercycle especially when their multiples have become stretched
