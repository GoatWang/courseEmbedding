hour  kmh and the original construction had two lanes in each direction a third lane was built to serve hov traffic in  for a short period between the end of construction and the start of hov limits drivers of single passenger vehicles used the lane and contacted government officials opposing the hov policy in response congress which did not have direct control over the highway passed special legislation prohibiting the imposition of hov restrictions on the route as a compromise to resolve the situation virginia decided to lift the hov restriction and to construct a fourth lane in each direction to serve hov traffic however unlike the third lane officials did not allow nonhov use at the end of construction in  and avoided a repeat of the controversy as a practical matter the right of way could not fit any additional lanes other than the current six in each direction however rep frank wolf again threatened to pass federal legislation prohibiting the fourth lane to be limited to hov traffic in  five companies submitted proposals to vdot to privatize the toll road which included payments to virginia that could be used for transportation in response mwaa made its own proposal

access road and the number of motorists who backtracked through the airport to commute to outer suburbs the virginia department of transportation determined a need for a limited access highway to serve points along the access road without subjecting airport traffic to congestion it was built in  by the virginia department of transportation as a toll highway because conventional funding was not available the toll road begins just inside the capital beltway near west falls church at a connector to interstate  to washington dc travels westward through fairfax county past dulles and terminates at the entrance to the dulles greenway a privately owned toll road officially the road is named the omer l hirst – adelard l brault expressway in honor of two virginia state legislators however the road is rarely referred to by that name the speed limit is  miles per hour  kmh and the original construction had two lanes in each direction a third lane was built to serve hov traffic in  for a short period between the end of construction and the start of hov limits drivers of single passenger vehicles used the lane and contacted government officials opposing the hov policy in response congress which did not have direct control over the highway passed special legislation prohibiting the imposition of hov restrictions on the route as a compromise to resolve the situation virginia decided to lift the hov restriction and to construct a fourth lane in each direction to serve hov traffic however unlike the third lane officials did not allow nonhov use at the end of construction in  and avoided a repeat of the controversy as a practical matter the right of way could not fit any additional lanes other than the current six in each direction however rep frank wolf again threatened to pass federal legislation prohibiting the fourth lane to be limited to hov traffic in  five companies submitted proposals to vdot to privatize the toll road which included payments to virginia that could be used for transportation in response mwaa made its own proposal to take over operation of the toll road from vdot assuming associated debts and commit to building a rapid transit line in the

generalaccess exits from the westbound lanes and no generalaccess entrances to the eastbound lanes with the exception of gated slip ramps to and from the toll road that buses and emergency vehicles can use the access road was built from the beltway as part of the construction of dulles airport and opened with the airport in  it was extended to i in  until  the dulles access road was operated by the virginia department of transportation vdot under contract with the metropolitan washington airports authority the owner of the land under both the access road and the dulles toll road and has the unsigned designation of state route  the dulles airport access road can be used only for travel to and from dulles airport and other businesses such as air freight hotels and gas stations on the airport grounds although it is illegal to use the access road without conducting such airport business some commuters evade the toll and the traffic on the toll road by taking the access road to the airport then backtracking to their exit for a couple of years prior to the opening of the dulles toll road vdot issued special stickers allowing commuters for a fee to backtrack legally along the access highway but these were discontinued when the toll road opened since the opening of the dulles toll road the only major modification to the access road was the construction of a flyover exit ramp from the eastbound access road to state route  this ramp bypasses congestion associated with the main toll plaza where traffic from dulles airport attempts to exit at route  dulles toll roadedit

access road and the number of motorists who backtracked through the airport to commute to outer suburbs the virginia department of transportation determined a need for a limited access highway to serve points along the access road without subjecting airport traffic to congestion it was built in  by the virginia department of transportation as a toll highway because conventional funding was not available the toll road begins just inside the capital beltway near west falls church at a connector to interstate  to washington dc travels westward through fairfax county past dulles and terminates at the entrance to the dulles greenway a privately owned toll road officially the road is named the omer l hirst – adelard l brault expressway in honor of two virginia state legislators however the road is rarely referred to by that name the speed limit is  miles per hour  kmh and the original construction had two lanes in each direction a third lane was built to serve hov traffic in  for a short period between the end of construction and the start of hov limits drivers of single passenger vehicles used the lane and contacted government officials opposing the hov policy in response congress which did not have direct control over the highway passed special legislation prohibiting the imposition of hov restrictions on the route as a compromise to resolve the situation virginia decided to lift the hov restriction and to construct a fourth lane in each direction to serve hov traffic however unlike the third lane officials did not allow nonhov use at the end of construction in  and avoided a repeat of the controversy as a practical matter the right of way could not fit any additional lanes other than the current six in each direction however rep frank wolf again threatened to pass federal legislation prohibiting the fourth lane to be limited to hov traffic in  five companies submitted proposals to vdot to privatize the toll road which included payments to virginia that could be used for transportation in response mwaa made its own proposal to take over operation of the toll road from vdot assuming associated debts and commit to building a rapid transit line in the median vdot agreed and on march   mwaa took over from virginia the operation of the dulles toll road including the outstanding debt and the obligation to construct the silver line in the median strip

project the responsibility for operating the road was scheduled to revert to virginia in  via a concession agreement in  the virginia state corporation commission extended this period to the year  historyedit the road was envisioned as early as the s when new residents were attracted to loudoun county because of the relatively low cost of real estate the greenway proposal prompted the enactment of the virginia highway corporation act of  that authorizes the construction of new toll roads without the use of eminent domain under rates set by the virginia corporation commission the law requires the facility to be turned over to the state after a stated time period the road was completed and opened in  but the original owners defaulted on its loan due to lower than projected use it receives no public funds was built with no subsidies and is policed at its own expense competing as a wholly private enterprise with the statebuilt and maintained roads tolls are computed to assure that the owner will recover the original investment plus a return on that investment the losses incurred during the early years of the project are rolled forward to justify higher tolls in later years
