by the results in the senate race as the republicans kept control of the senate which was a major surprise because of this some in the media are characterizing this as a republican “sweep” we don’t see it this way as the majority in the senate remains narrow and leadership in the house doesn’t necessarily see eye to eye with president elect trump appropriate checks and balances in government
