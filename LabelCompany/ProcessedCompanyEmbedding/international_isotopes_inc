financial results for the fiscal year ended december  revenuetotal revenue for the company in  decreased by approximately  compared to  primarily due to a decline in radiological services during  as described below  additional details regarding the financial results of our business segments are discussed further in this releasesteve laflin president and ceo of the company said while we saw a small decline in revenue for  i am pleased with the significant progress we have made towards launching new products and we expect sales to increase in  and beyond  we believe our most significant accomplishment for the year was our submittal of the abbreviated new drug application to the us food and drug administration fda for our iodinemaxtm sodium iodide i radiopharmaceutical product  this is the first generic application in the us for this product which is in strong demand for the treatment and diagnosis of various diseases of the thyroid gland such as graves disease thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism  the time frame for fda approval is uncertain  however once approved we are prepared to quickly launch fullscale commercial sales of the drug product and expect to see a positive impact to our total company revenue from the sales of this single product alonesales of radiochemical products accounted for approximately  of our total revenue in   in  our revenue in this segment increased by approximately  and was driven largely by an  increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of   the large increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of  was primarily the result of having a major competitor for sodium iodide stop supplying that product in october   this change in competitive outlook is expected to have a lasting positive impact on sales of that product through cobalt product sales accounted for approximately  of our total sales revenue in   sales in this segment decreased approximately  in  compared to  the decrease was due to the continued impact of the interruption of cobalt supply from the department of energys does advanced test reactor atr and our limited options of obtaining an alternate cobalt supply  we have identified at least one alternative short term supply of cobalt and we anticipate having a significant improvement in revenue within this segment in  and  sales of nuclear medicine standards accounted for approximately  of our total revenue in  revenue in this segment decreased by approximately  in  as compared to  and was largely the result of the decline in sales by ti services  about  of the revenue within this segment is attributed to sales by ti services llc ti services a  joint venture that we formed with radqual in december   the remaining  of revenue in this segment are produced under our exclusive manufacturing agreement with radqual  in  revenue from ti services declined approximately  while sales to radqual increased about  compared to   we expect a continued small decline in ti services sales in  but anticipate continued growth in the sales to radqualrevenue from our radiological services segment accounted for approximately  of our total sales revenue in   revenue in this segment decreased by approximately  compared to  and this decline had the largest impact upon our  revenue results  the decline in revenue was largely attributed to the reduction in opportunities for contract awards under the does off site source recovery program osrp  we anticipate a significant increase in contract opportunities under the osrp in  and also expect several international source recovery contract opportunities as well  we have already received three award contracts under this program thus far in there was no revenue to report from the fluorine products segment for  however the company still remains confident in the future opportunity for this project  therefore we continue to maintain all necessary licenses permits and agreements within new mexico to ensure we are in a position to rapidly resume work on this project when market conditions present the opportunityread morecost of revenues and gross profitcost of revenue for  decreased approximately  compared to  and our gross profit percentage increased to  for  from  in   during  we continued to monitor and control direct costs  raw materials used in both our radiochemical products and our nuclear medicine standards manufacturing represent the bulk of direct costs in each of these business segments   we were able to significantly reduce the manufacturing costs in our nuclear medicine products in  by decreasing scrapped material by approximately  which made a major impact on overall manufacturing costoperating costs and expensestotal operating costs and expenses for  increased approximately  compared to    the increase was primarily attributable to increases in general administrative and consulting expenses caused by increases in waste disposal and other administrative costs during   the increase in waste disposal cost is not expected to occur again for several years  the increase in legal expense was related to an ongoing arbitration the company is pursuing and should conclude in the first half of net lossour net loss was  in  compared to a net loss of  in   this is an increase in loss of approximately   our increase in net loss is primarily the result of our decrease in revenue of approximately  as well as our increased expenditures for operating costsmr laflin further commented while we expect sales of our new iodinemaxtm sodium iodide product to offer long term improvement in revenue we believe we have also taken decisive steps to improve revenue in the nearer term for our cobalt products and radiological services segments  in the radiological services segment we anticipate a significant increase in the number and size of contract opportunities for radiological field services and source recovery in  under the does osrp program  in the cobalt products segment we have been able to acquire some cobalt to resume sealed source manufacturing later in  and will also begin to ship cobalt and recognize revenue under our agreement with the doe beginning in mid to late   these factors should have a significant impact on overall company revenue in  and  continuing to look even further down the road we believe that similar to iodinemaxtm sodium iodide there are several other opportunities for generic pharmaceutical products that the company can readily manufacture  we expect to continue to advance our pipeline of additional generic products in the coming
