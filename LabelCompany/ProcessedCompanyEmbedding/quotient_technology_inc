couponscom corporate  company story client login contact us client login contact us close close leaving paper and scissors behind early one sunday morning steven boal watched his fatherinlaw descend the stairs trudge out the front door to grab the newspaper and then scissors in hand set up camp at the kitchen table where he busily clipped coupons boal knew there had to be a better way he researched the industry and found that the multibilliondollar coupon business hadn’t changed in three decades the internet was beginning to chip away at all sorts of industries—music news finance—improving and revolutionizing each one boal set his sights on coupons in  shortly after watching his fatherinlaw’s sunday trudge boal a finance executive who specialized in developing technologies pulled in two people he knew could help him change the future of couponing michele boal his wife had years of marketing and communications experience and understood the family shopper on many levels it helped that she was raised in a home where saving was critical to making ends meet next steven recruited former colleague mike walsh over a coffee with pencil and napkin in hand the two mapped out a technology strategy that would become the foundation for what quotient is today walsh remains the company’s chief security officer and head of research and development michele leads our coupons for change initiatives which you can read about here the hurdles weren’t small the company spent three years developing the technology that enabled digital coupons to work for manufacturers which issue the coupons and for retailers which redeem them since coupons are a form of currency manufacturers required strict security and print limits before they would recognize digital coupons as an alternative to paper once the security and print controls were in place boal’s company faced the next challenge persuading providers of consumer packaged goods cpgs—the companies that make and distribute much of the world’s food personalcare and householdcleaning products—to shift their promotional budgets from paper to digital in april  almost three years after the company’s launch the couponscom team issued its first digital coupon on a client’s website a couple of months later came the company’s consumer website—now couponscom—where shoppers could peruse a collection of offers constantly innovating since those early days quotient has pioneered the digital transformation of the promotions industry beginning with coupons that shoppers print at home that business continues strong—an easier far more efficient alternative to the paper coupons stuffed into mailboxes across the country in  alone shoppers printed hundreds of millions of offers in this form from couponscom but quotient continually innovating now does much more the company delivers purely digital coupons directly to shoppers through mobile apps automatically loads offers onto shoppers’ credit cards store loyalty cards and cardlessshopping accounts and delivers brand messages to shoppers across all devices through coupons’ online network of approximately  publishers which include the websites of retailers as well as lifestyle sites and popular blogger sites in  couponscom began running entire digitalcoupon programs—and in some cases becoming the loyalty program—for major retailers read about all our solutions a complete tool kit for deploying offers and messaging here along with coupons’ wideranging delivery capabilities are the platform’s deep data assets quotient is one of the few marketing data providers that can link instore purchase data to data about online behavior this enables us to target offers digital advertising and messages to the shoppers who are most valuable to a brand marrying online and instore data provides quotient’s clients with unprecedented intelligence about each consumer’s past purchases and futurepurchase intent since we are able to read purchase intent in a consumer’s online behavior all this intelligence on our proprietary platform can further optimize returns on each promotional campaign growing market opportunity the reach of our industryleading network is unparalleled last year alone we powered more than  billion digitalcoupon transactions and we’re just getting started the opportunity is vast cpgs alone distributed  billion coupons representing a total discount value of  billion in the united states last year according to the annual industry report pdf by nch marketing services most of those coupons were distributed on paper in circulars or newspaper inserts even though the bulk of them ended up in the trash as a result of those  billion coupons digital including printable and paperless represented less than  percent digital accounted for more than  percent of total redemptions however demonstrating the effectiveness of digital promotions over paper that’s not surprising especially considering the sophistication that quotient brings to the industry delivering offers and messages that are personalized to be relevant informed by countless data points from shopper behavior online and off in short quotient’s communications reach the right shoppers with the right offers at the right time the rapid rise of smartphones is broadening the demographic reach and increasing the use of digital promotions for instance more than  million adults in the united states will use digital coupons in  a jump of more than  percent from last year the research firm emarketer projects even better our own data shows that people who use digital coupons use more coupons and spend more in general than those paperclippers of yesteryear what our clients are saying about us nsight connect “one of quotient’s

nongaap financial measure quotient has presented adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure in this press release because it is a key measure used by quotients management and board of directors to understand and evaluate core operating performance and trends to prepare and approve its annual budget to develop short and longterm operational plans and to determine bonus payouts and executive officer compensation in particular the company believes that the exclusion of the income expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for periodtoperiod comparisons of its core business additionally adjusted ebitda is a key financial measure used by the compensation committee of the board of directors in connection with the determination of compensation for its executive officers accordingly quotient believes that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the companys operating results in the same manner as the companys management and board of directors quotient defines adjusted ebitda as net incomeloss adjusted for stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization interest expense other income expense – net provision for benefit from income taxes net change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration onetime charge associated with certain distribution fees gain on sale of right to use a web domain name and charges related to enterprise resource planning software implementation costs quotients use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of quotients financial results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are although depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements and adjusted ebitda does not reflect i changes in or cash requirements for working capital needs ii the potentially dilutive impact of stockbased compensation iii tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to quotient iv the effects of stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization interest expense other income expense – net provision for benefit from income taxes net change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration  one time charge for certain distribution fees gain on sale of right to use a web domain name and charges related to enterprise resource planning software implementation costs and v other companies including companies in its industry may calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure this nongaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation from as substitutes for or as superior to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap because of these and other limitations adjusted ebitda should be considered along with other gaapbased financial performance measures including various cash flow metrics net loss and the companys other gaap financial results for a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to the nearest comparable gaap financial measure see
