technology is based on cardiospheres csps which are multicell clusters of cardiacderived cells the companys lead product candidate the cardiospherederived cells cdcs are the single cell monolayer product of the csps cdcs are small enough that within acceptable dose limits they can be injected down a coronary artery without damaging the heart muscle both csps and cdcs are derived from a deceased human donor allogeneic source or from heart tissue taken directly from recipient patients themselves autologous sourcecapthe companys lead product candidate consists of allogeneic cdcs the company is testing cap in its allstar phase ii clinical trial it is a dual cohort clinical trial that has two independently recruiting strata the first are patients having experienced a myocardial infarction mi  to  days post myocardial infarction and the second are patients having suffered a myocardial infarction within one year  days to year post mi to see if the cells can reduce the size of older more established scar the company is evaluating cap in the dynamic clinical study to assess the safety and feasibility of delivering cap to advanced heart failure patients additionally the

cap in patients with cardiomyopathy related to duchenne muscular dystrophycapthe companys product candidate cap consists of autologous cdcs the product was used in the phase i caduceus clinical trialcardiospheresthe csps are multicellular clusters called cardiospheres a three dimensional d microtissue from which cdcs are derived it has shown healing effects in preclinical models of heart failureexosomesexosomes are nanosized membraneenclosed vesicles that are filled with select molecules including proteins ribonucleic acids rnas and micrornas which when released send messages to neighboring cells to regulate cellular functions exosomes act as a transport vehicle out of the cell for microrna other fragments of genetic material and proteins that act as messengers between cells providing regulatory function for many cell processes including inflammation angiogenesis programmed cell death apoptosis and scarring the company is in preclinical testing to explore the therapeutic benefits that exosomes may possess and the indications in which they may be investigatedcenderitide cdnpcenderitide cdnp belongs to a class of drugs called natriuretic peptides cenderitide is a
