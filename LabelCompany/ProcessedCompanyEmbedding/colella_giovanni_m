afternoon and thank you for joining us the third quarter was an important period for us to assess the progress of our gotomarket efforts considering the changes we made in our sales organization coming into the year in advance of what has historically been a seasonally strong period for us from a sales standpoint in addition we were very active on the product and the partnerships fronts in q i will cover the highlights of these areas and then nita will provide more details on our newest product and exciting new strategic collaboration we announced today with anthem john will close with a review of q results and updated guidance in addition to our early thoughts on growth in  and our path to positive cash flow so lets start with third quarter business highlights first we signed  net new customers during the quarter among these were four new fortune  customers including boeing and spartannash overall were very pleased to now be working with almost  customers including more than  of the fortune  with that said while we were pleased to continue adding great brands to the castlight family and we did exceed our revenue objectives for the quarter we were disappointed that our sales productivity did not ramp to the level we expected in q our pipeline remains robust but the bottom line is that we need to improve our ability to bring deals over the finish line more quickly and with greater predictability in addition to our own efforts we are now at the right point of our business and also in the market development to increase leverage through channel partners that can help shorten our sales cycle for this reason the collaboration we announced today with anthem is an important part of our plan to accelerate sales velocity as we leverage increased sales capacity we have the broadest and deepest platform to capitalize on customer demand for new solutions to optimize their healthcare investments we continue to expand our product portfolio with the launch of our second major new product this year castlight action this product is a powerful advance beyond transparency because it gives benefit leaders simple and effective new ways to proactively connect populations who need care with the benefits and programs that can help them while its still very early we are pleased with the initial traction of both elevate our behavioral health product launched in q and action and we expect both to have broad appeal across our customer base and with new prospects we also completed our  renewal cycle in q we continue to achieve excellent results not just renewing customers but also expanding what we do for them ultimately renewals are the most important indicator of the value our customers are receiving for our ehm solutions so were pleased to be on pace to exceed  net dollar retention for the year as we look ahead to  we think the continued ramping on the sales force two exciting new products and a better balance of direct sales and channel sales capacity put us in a good position to drive longterm growth from a direct sales perspective it is important to note that almost half of our new logos in q were deals completed by sales reps that joined us this year which is an indication that were making progress albeit not at the pace we were hoping for when planning our business at the beginning of the year as i mentioned among the highlights for q we are increasing our focus on working with channel partners this initiative resulted in collaboration with anthem that we announced today nita will go into more details but essentially we will power the cost and quality transparency tool that anthems affiliated health plans offer their clients and most of all our sales teams will work together to drive broader adoption of the castlight ehm solutions among these clients our mission is to help organizations optimize delivery of healthcare benefits and help people to make better choices for their health we think this partnership is a breakthrough for its potential to accelerate the adoption of castlight technology among the tens of millions of members who get their healthcare coverage from anthem affiliates now before turning the call over to nita i also want to update you on a few changes related to our organizational structure and management teams as we position the company to scale to the next level first of all john doyle has been promoted to chief operating officer in addition to remaining castlights chief financial officer he will assume responsibility for marketing and customer operations teams john has played a big role in guiding castlights rapid growth improving our operational efficiency and he has deep domain expertise in the products were bringing to market as well as the challenges were solving for our customers as we have evolved from a single product company to a comprehensive ehm platform we expect our overall gotomarket execution to further improve with this welldeserved promotion for john second john mccracken our svp of worldwide sales will now report directly to me he has responsibility for driving the success of our direct sales team as well as all sales collaboration activities with channel partners including anthem john is a proven enterprise sales leader with deep experience scaling sales organization to many times the current size of castlight most notably at mercury interactive he has been with us for less than a year and in that time we can see that we are on the right path to building a top performance sales organization to drive strong growth for many years ahead i am very excited to work with john more closely moving forward finally related to these changes michele law will be leaving castlight on november  to pursue other opportunities she helped castlight during its initial period of hypergrowth and we want to thank her for her contribution and wish her well in her future endeavors in summary i have high expectation for castlight and our team castlight pioneered healthcare transparency and in the last few years we have built on that foundation so that today our customers have an unprecedented ability to leverage technology to deliver great benefits and enable their people to make well informed decisions about their health im inspired by dedication of our people and incredibly excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us we are committed as ever to executing of that opportunities for our customers and our shareholders and now i will turn the call over to nita to describe our newest product castlight action and our exciting collaboration with anthem in more detail nita nita sommers  chief strategy officer thanks gio in our extensive work with customers and prospects we consistently hear that they are focused on three things controlling costs improving benefit satisfaction and managing a complex array of programs castlight action helps benefit leaders in each of these areas uses powerful predicted analytics to identify in segment populations who are most likely to access certain categories of high cost care and then automate personalized targeted outreach to guide them to highly relevant cost effective benefit programs the castlight platform technology behind action is complex and innovative but the user experience of benefit leaders is realtime simple and clear we invite you to see it for yourself on upcoming webcast demo of castlight action details will be announced separately in the next few weeks we are seeing strong customer interest for our newest products weve had five purchases of castlight action by fortune  customers and five of elevate we recognized years ago that our customers will need much more than transparency and that was why we built out a broad and growing enterprise healthcare management platform the breadth and depth of our platform is a major reason why castlight is a market leader and it had also enabled us to leverage our lead in transparency to establish the collaborations we announced today as gio discussed we believe it is the right moment for castlight to build out strong channel partnerships that provide leverage for our national direct sales team the collaboration with anthem positions us to solidify our leadership position by accelerating the pace at which we get our message and products to market here is more detail on how the collaboration will work first castlight will over time power the cost and quality transparency tool that anthems affiliated health plans offer through their member websites starting immediately castlight anthems affiliates will launch a joint gotomarket strategy to crosssell castlight ehm products as part of this effort anthem is financially incented through our revenue share program for castlights sales effort further we believe theres additional motivation for anthems affiliates to promote castlights offering to further strengthen their local competitive position castlight and anthem will invest in enhanced data infrastructure to deliver a differentiated product experience and significantly easier and shorter implementation timelines for castlights proprietary employer offerings the organization looks for opportunities to develop unique joint products together and importantly castlight technology will be deployed in markets that castlight does not currently serve including smaller businesses that tend to be fully insured which creates new opportunities for castlight to expand its market reach over time our sales organization will work closely with local sales team from anthems affiliates to capitalize on the significant lead generation opportunity we expect from this new relationship that said we also remain committed to serving enterprises and their employees across all health plans and benefit programs let me turn the call over to john to go through the financials now john c doyle  chief financial officer thanks nita and good afternoon everyone as you heard from gio and from nita weve made steady progress building the business so far this year this progress in the form of new products strong renewals and growing channel leverage increases our confidence that will drive strong growth in the business over the longterm based on our sales results in the third quarter and our overall book of business as of today were expecting revenue growth in the mid range in  while this is very healthy growth by most standards it is below the level we were targeting with our investments in the business particularly in sales and marketing as a result weve already begun to adjust our spending plans to stay on track with our goal to reach cash flow breakeven early in  with substantial cash remaining on our balance sheet theres significant room to leverage investments weve already made across our business to support greater scale and to be clear we also expect to see improved sales productivity in  as our team continues to ramp and we leverage channel opportunities that we didnt have before we will provide more specific guidance for  on our fourth quarter call but to provide a high level preview of our investment plans for next year we have positioned the business to hold operating expenses less than  growth for the full year against topline growth in the mid range as i referenced a moment ago one reason that were providing an early view into our expectations for  is that we have good revenue visibility as a function of our subscription business model historically weve shared customer accounts each quarter and average annual revenue per customer to enable you to gauge the progress of our growth initiatives however as our business has evolved and deal sizes vary renewals and crosssales increased and product mix changes from quarterto quarter these metrics have become less reliable indicators of our future growth as a result beginning today we will share our annual recurring revenue under contract or arr as of quarter end each time we report quarterly financial results we believe this metric will give investors clear visibility in the current sales momentum and our growth expectations for subscription revenue before sharing the metric for q  i want to be very clear what it represents arr represents annualized subscription revenues under contract as of quarter end this includes arr from new customers and crosssales that weve not implemented yet and excludes all amounts related to terminated or expired contracts importantly our arr metric also exclude nonsubscription revenues such as the professional services revenue we derived from the fees we charge for implementations and communications services as of the end of the third quarter we had  million in arr under contract representing yearoveryear growth of  when compared to  million in arr under contract at the end of q  historically given the timeline between when we sign a customer contract and when we begin recognizing subscription revenue arr has been a good predictor of our annualized subscription revenue run rate three quarters to five quarters in the future for example our annualized subscription revenue run rate based on subscription revenues of  million in q  was  million the same amount as arr at the end of q last year looking ahead to  we believe it is appropriate to assume that it will take us four quarters to five quarters to reach an annualized subscription revenue run rate of  million the amount of arr we had under contract at the end of q  the timeline assumption is slightly longer than weve seen most recently because our sales in  have been heavily weighted to crosssells and our implementation timelines for these new products are initially longer than our portfolio average clearly were focused on converting arr to revenue and billings at a faster pace over time as we continue to bring down implementation timelines across our entire product suite now lets turn to our third quarter financials i will be briefer than in the past so we can get to questions about the important forwardlooking topics weve talked about today total revenue for the third quarter was  million which is up  compared to the same period last year subscription revenue which constituted  of total revenue increased  we launched eight customers on the castlight essentials platform and  customers on crosssell products during the quarter gross margin was  in the third quarter compared with  in q and up strongly compared with  in the same quarter a year ago our longterm gross margin target remains unchanged at  to  total operating expenses were  million in q which was down  sequentially from q  consistent with our plan to moderate expense growth through next year sales and marketing expenses were  million in q which was  below q in the prior quarter we had a seasonal increase in marketing spend related to customer events rd expense was  million in q which represented an increase of  yearoveryear weve had great success attracting outstanding rd talent this year in one of the most competitive hiring environments for technical talent in the world this has been a key highlight because the expertise and capacity weve added in rd is a critical element of continuing to deliver the products that will drive our future growth ga expenses were  million in q which was down  sequentially as there were some nonroutine expenses in last quarters ga line our q net loss was  million compared to a net loss of  million in the second quarter we ended q with  million in cash and investments cash used in operations was  million in the third quarter of  compared with  million in the previous quarter let me now turn to our q and full year  financial outlook for q we expect total revenue of between  million and  million a nongaap operating loss in the range of  million to  million and a nongaap net loss per share of  to  based on  million weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding based on our fourth quarter guidance we expect full year total revenue of between  million and  million we expect a full year nongaap operating loss of  million to  million and a nongaap net loss per share of between  and  based on  million to  million weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding finally we expect our cash used in operations to be between  million and  million for  the increased cash usage in  compared to our prior guidance is the result of lower than expected sales in q in addition to the mix of new bookings compared with our plans these factors led to lower billings than we had forecasted as i discussed earlier were operating against plans that have us breaking even from a cash flow perspective in early  these plans incorporate a significant decrease in our level of cash burn in  relative to  as revenue and billings growth far exceed expense growth as we look ahead were excited about the business organizations and their people continue to face daunting challenges when it comes to optimizing healthcare benefits and making good choices castlight has built powerful solutions to help them address these challenges more effectively than ever before we are focused on improving and enhancing our gotomarket execution in order to fully capitalize on our strong market position and the opportunity in front of us we think our plans are solid and were totally committed to making them happen with that gio nita and i will be happy to take questions questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of robert jones from goldman sachs your line is open robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co thanks for the questions and john congratulations on the expanded role i guess just to start with the initial outlook on sales growth for  just a quick math it seems like youre calling for probably about half of the growth or about  million probably less than the trajectory that we were expecting understanding that we saw some changes throughout the year with the sales force that has played a part in productivity it still seems like a fairly big change compared to the way we were probably and that you were probably viewing the world previously so i guess if we just go back here in time what would you say were the kind of one two or three biggest assumptions where people were probably most off i mean was it the competitive landscape was there any change in pricing just trying to get maybe a couple of points that could kind of help us square the initial outlook on  relative to where we were kind of thinking it would be john c doyle  chief financial officer yeah thanks bob this is john first of all i think there are a number of things that have gone well and its important to start there so first of all q results much improved versus q and q weve seen good uptake from fortune  businesses all year earlier this year gm for example and then we talked about boeing and spartannash in the call and weve begun to see contributions from new reps and clearly that team is going to continue to ramp the channel relationship weve talked about today is another forwardlooking opportunity that were very excited about clearly weve got to get better on velocity and predictability of our sales cycles to be specific about the factor or assumption in our models anyway that is most germane here definitely sales cycle so what we didnt see were losses its not a competitive dynamic were excited about the deals in the pipeline but what we very definitely observed is longer deal cycles than we were anticipating in our model and thats really the story of q and as you know q is a big quarter for us so when you look ahead to  and think about topline growth in  its a direct relationship robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co and i guess thats helpful if we think about one of the metrics you shared that maybe gets at just a little bit more specifically the net dollar retention of i think you said just over  or at least  could you maybe just even qualitatively help us think about the composition of that i mean were there losses were the upsells within some of the renewed contracts maybe not as robust as you had hoped just any additional insight into the components around the net dollar retention metric would be helpful john c doyle  chief financial officer sure and to be clear were well ahead of  on net dollar retention well provide specific outcome there at the end of the year but we feel great about it in fact if you remember back to the analyst day we talked at that time about a much smaller cohort of customers that we had renewed at that point where we saw plus uplift on new contracts with some of our biggest customers who had been renewing and  has been a big year for us for renewal so its one of the real bright spots where weve seen strong growth in the book of business we had coming into  which to your point created a good foundation for us to drive strong growth in  and that certainly has been our focus the reality is as i said we saw just a bunch of deals slipping through q which had been a quarter in previous years when the prospect of an implementation time coming in q was a very effective way to bring sales cycles to a close and get those deals completed and this quarter we just didnt deliver there and as i said that plays through very directly on  growth robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co okay and i guess just one last one if i could sneak it in on the anthem announcement just so i understand this better so is this really castlight being sold as part of the anthem offering into employers and health plans and if that is the case just any help around how the economics on that type of castlight sale would look relative to the more traditional castlight sale will be helpful for us nita sommers  chief strategy officer yeah thanks bob this is nita ill take this one and so just so the relationship is that castlight will over time start powering the cost and quality transparency tools on anthemcom so those are essentially the offerings that are made available to all members of anthems affiliates and well take that over in exchange for us taking on that and delivering a bestinclass service to their population we will on exchange be getting comprehensive gotomarket and data support and really this is very exciting in my perspective for castlight because as john talked about one of the key reasons that we really believe that channels can be important to us at this point in the trajectory of the business is that it can really help accelerate our ability to get to market accelerate sales cycle and the like by having key influencers really advocating for castlight and its product solution set and so thats really the nature of the relationship robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co okay got it thanks so much guys john c doyle  chief financial officer thanks bob operator your next question comes from the line of zack sopcak from morgan stanley your line is open zachary w sopcak  morgan stanley  co llc hey this is zack thanks for the question wanted to follow up with a question on anthem and just when we think about it as that relationship matures how does that impact current castlight customers that are on anthem does anything change in the way their contracts are like – are structured with you nita sommers  chief strategy officer so really nothing changes in terms of the contracts that we have with our clients the service that were going to be building for anthem and its population is really kind of focused on cost and quality transparency tools similar in scale to what other health plans offer their membership today really what were selling to the employers remains very differentiated from that in terms our ehm platform tackling broader issues such as employee engagement underutilization of programs and providing more detailed analytics and insights and so really that kind of extended platform is still what were going to be selling to the employers and now are excited to have anthem promoting that in the field as well zachary w sopcak  morgan stanley  co llc okay got you thats helpful thank you and then just getting back to following up on bobs question that fy  guidance and bookings was there any particular area when youre looking at bookings in q that was more the cause of those business appointment than you thought was it more in the fortune  or was it a broader customer base john c doyle  chief financial officer thanks zack this is john so the bias certainly in our deals over the last three quarters or four quarters is weighted towards bigger accounts and thats where weve been investing aggressively with the sales force one of the reasons were so pleased to continue adding these fortune  customers so when you think about the gap in sales in q it really is a function of a number of these large deals slipping out in time zachary w sopcak  morgan stanley  co llc and just one quick followup on that so are they – is the decision then that could be made at a later point or have they chosen to go in a different direction john c doyle  chief financial officer we feel very good about where those relationships are broadly speaking so the sales force has been out in the field working with prospects in these customers and i think making good progress the reality is deals havent moved as quickly as we would like but we feel good about the longterm trajectory of those dialogues and where theyre likely to come out so from a longterm business perspective we see the market opportunity we see great responses from these customers in these processes weve got a very highly skilled sales team getting ramped here and now these channel relationships as well and our rd team just delivered two outstanding new products and so as operators in the business were very excited about where were headed in the longterm and this quarter doesnt do anything to dissuade us from that the reality is we missed the forecasting of these timelines on sales and weve got to get better at that no question zachary w sopcak  morgan stanley  co llc okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brad reback from stifel your line is open brad r reback  stifel nicolaus  co inc hey guys giovanni m colella  cofounder  chief executive officer hey brad brad r reback  stifel nicolaus  co inc can you commit to burning less cash in  than  or at least say thats the plan john c doyle  chief financial officer yeah yeah thanks brad it will give me a chance to emphasize what i said in the script were going to burn significantly less cash in  than we did  were committed to the early  timing for reaching cash flow positive our preliminary guidance on operating expenses is that we will grow opex less than  in  and weve got great revenue visibility into next year so while weve guided to mids healthy growth but we understand below where some of the outside models have been we have  visibility to that topline so as we think about billings and the leverage we can get out of the operating expense lines we feel very confident that we can burn a lot less cash next year than we did this year brad r reback  stifel nicolaus  co inc great and just one quick followup if i take the arr numbers that youve given us and assume sort of that fourquarter to fivequarter implementation golive it would appear to me that by the back half of  growth should actually reaccelerate so bottom sometime around q and then reaccelerate given what youve signed up already john c doyle  chief financial officer yeah its a great point and if you think about in the script we talked about arr growth yearonyear of  weve given topline revenue guidance of  the reason for the gap there is this cycle were in where weve got new products frankly coming in at a faster rate than we imagined in terms of the uptake weve seen those are the products when theyre initially launched that take a bit longer for us to implement as those timelines come down to our portfolio average you would expect the growth rate on topline to parallel what youre seeing in arr and we do think that will happen brad r reback  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thanks very much john c doyle  chief financial officer thanks a lot brad operator your next question comes from the line of frank sparacino from first analysis your line is open frank sparacino  first analysis securities corp hi guys two questions from me first just can you talk about given the weakness from a bookings standpoint from an implementation point of view where youre at is there excess capacity and how do you look at that in  john c doyle  chief financial officer sure so in terms of the implementation capacity its one of the places i think weve got leverage in the business because as you noted q sales came in below what we had planned to and we hire ahead of some of these forecasts and so that is an area of leverage in terms of what were talking about when we talk about the longer implementation timelines let me take a minute just to be extra clear there we have been focused over the last year on improving implementation timelines on our core product and also castlight pharmacy a crosssell that weve talked about in the past both of those products now are approaching sixmonth implementation times the core product is already there pharmacy is approaching that level very much on track getting those core products into a routine and acceptable timeline what has happened this year is more than half of our bookings this year have come from our newest products very significant contribution from newest products that wasnt what we forecast coming into the year and every time we introduce a new product youre going to start off on the high end of implementation timelines and then work that down over time and so what youre seeing next year is we expect this uptick of the newest products to be continuing and so the overall portfolio average implementation times are going to be a little bit higher than weve seen most recently and thats the dynamic but again as i was mentioning in the response to the question brad asked we do expect those times to come in to our portfolio average of about six months over time frank sparacino  first analysis securities corp great and last can you just talk about anthem a little bit more i guess from a competitive standpoint i assume the alternative was anthem building or continuing to build their own – or just the dynamic there giovanni m colella  cofounder  chief executive officer yeah well thank you this is gio thank you for the question its a good question yes obviously anthem has many of the – they had many alternatives in front of them let me focus really on why this deal now and why its so important for us we are at a stage in the business in which we have the scale and the breadth of products that makes this deal incredibly exciting for both parties and so when we started discussing this with anthem we both realized that this was one of those situations where it could be a winwin for both of us and so there was no need for alternatives it was just a matter of how do we work together and we came to a very good partnership nita sommers  chief strategy officer hello giovanni m colella  cofounder  chief executive officer hello operator your next question comes from the line of brian peterson from raymond james your line is open brian c peterson  raymond james  associates inc hi guys thanks for taking the question just wanted to clarify on the guidance i know you have  visibility in the  growth but i just want to understand of that  how much of that is coming from new products like elevate or action or will implementation timelines kind of prevent that from making a big contribution in  john c doyle  chief financial officer those – the contributions from the new products are to next years growth rate very significant as i just said more than half of the bookings that we recorded so far this year came from those new products and thats really what drives the growth youre seeing a year later in  so very significant contribution in terms of the opportunity to improve results next year relative to guidance it does really come down to implementation timelines and we are going to be very focused as you would imagine on bringing those timelines in but thats really where the opportunity is brian c peterson  raymond james  associates inc okay and i know some of your new products specifically with action and pulse last quarter are a little bit of a different approach in that theyre sold specifically to the hr buyer im curious is that enabling or potentially complicating the gotomarket and i know action was just released but any help on what that would be in terms of an uplift to acv giovanni m colella  cofounder  chief executive officer yeah hi thank you this is a very good question this is gio and i spend my time in front of customers and im very excited about the interest and the demand for the new products in terms of your statement that were selling mostly to the hr buyer definitely weve seen much more interest from the hr suite especially for the products like action that are very data driven but we also constantly talk to benefit leaders and weve been expanding the relationship let me just tell you again its just at the beginning what im observing is especially action is finally the kind of product that is giving the benefit leader the authority to talk at the hr suite as a real leader with data in their hands and real realtime data on how to optimize the benefits that theyre getting so its changing the way the benefit leader perceives their own role so were very excited about that john c doyle  chief financial officer yeah let me add i think that from a gotomarket perspective were really very much in the sweet spot that we have been working in now for many years the difference is the product we were selling before action and elevate is a product where the end user was ultimately an employee not the actual buyer in the hr office and so what the new products do in addition we think to driving important results for the business is it also creates a new thread in the dialogue with the buyer around the product that he or she will be using directly an information that helps that individual do their job for their company more effectively than they had before and that is from a gotomarket perspective a helpful dynamic in the dialogue hopefully that answers that question you also asked about acv and how action impacts acv this is really one of the things were most excited about in the early demand for these products and its part of why the relationship with anthem is indicative of a really exciting direction for the business and it all comes back to the fact that the pricing on action and elevate is actually exceeding in many cases the pricing that we have achieved in the past for the core solution and if you followed the company weve talked about upsells being priced at  to  of the core these are products that are being sold for more than  of the core in some cases so really exciting opportunity for the business that allowed us to leverage the early need we had in transparency to build this broad relationship that weve talked about today and so acv going up strongly as a result of these new products and very very excited for the business brian c peterson  raymond james  associates inc okay john gio thanks for that thats great color and just on the anthem relationship just trying to understand the timing there is that potentially – when does that start and when do we really start to see that in the pl is there going to be a light switch type moment in the first quarter where we see more an open enrollment just trying to understand how thats going to impact the model nita sommers  chief strategy officer great question and so the gotomarket collaboration really starts immediately so teams are well underway and are starting to work together to identify accounts that are good for castlight and starting to move forward with that so really it will be a phenomenon thats impacting sales in  in terms of actually the rollout of the castlight powered solution for the anthem members thats going to take more time and that will start in kind of mid to latter half of  for us brian c peterson  raymond james  associates inc okay thanks guys john c doyle  chief financial officer thank you giovanni m colella  cofounder  chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of steven wardell from leerink your line is open steven wardell  leerink partners llc hey thank you and thanks for the question so my first question is can you tell us about the selling season qualitatively how is that going what are prospects saying what are they looking for how has your products been received how are prospects thinking about enterprise healthcare management what more can you tell us about the selling season giovanni m colella  cofounder  chief executive officer sure this is gio thank you for the question we are spending a lot of time with our customers and were seeing as i said a robust pipeline and as we emphasized during the call were seeing the timeline of deal closure longer than what we expected obviously theres a lot of interest in our new products as we emphasized here and lots of conversations with many customers so really what we are seeing from a sales standpoint is a very strong sales force coming up to speed and a slowness in the deals that make them longer to close than what we expected steven wardell  leerink partners llc great and when you think of your anthem partnership when castlight is selling direct to an employer you guys are offering enterprise healthcare management no one else that i know of is doing that but when anthem and you are selling a transparency to an anthem client how are you differentiated – think about the products there how is that differentiated from the other competitors in the sector nita sommers  chief strategy officer yeah so just to clarify that that sort of basic cost and quality transparency tool will be given to all of their membership over time they already offer a tool today so this is basically going to take that over and so its very similar to many many health plans amidst all the other health plans offer kind of solutions like that we certainly believe the one that well be powering is going to be bestinclass and will differentiate anthem relative to those other health plan solutions but its really about getting that technology out in the hands of millions of members im personally really excited about that portion of it because now castlight will be in that many users over time and so as we think about just what well be able to do with that data and with those sort of user insights over time theres a lot of interesting things from a product perspective that this enables steven wardell  leerink partners llc okay great thank you operator there are no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back over to ceo gio colella giovanni m colella  cofounder  chief executive officer thank you thank you all for

afternoon thanks charles and thank you all for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and full year  results as we discussed on our last call we did not achieve our growth objective for the year but we did make an important progress on several key initiatives that we believe provide a solid foundation to drive longterm growthbefore i dive into the details of these initiatives i thought i would take a moment to reflect on the opportunity that lies ahead of us first of all i remain very excited about the market opportunities for castlight employers across the county continue to see health benefits spend as an enormous problem enterprises are now spending over  billion a year on healthcare with  of it considered wastemoreover  of employees do not understand their health benefits and continue to struggle with making effective decisions as a result employersponsored benefit programs are massively underutilized all of these issues continue to make it challenging for employers to decrease cost improve health and drive benefit satisfactionnow given these drivers the opportunity for castlight remains as robust as ever our product offering has evolved from a bestinclass transparency product to a health benefit platform that provides a comprehensive solution to a multitude of healthcare problems for both employers and employees we provide a simple personalized and powerful platform for employees to shop for and manage their healthcare at the same time we enable our employers to understand their employees needs and guide them to the right care the right providers and the right programs at the right timethe growth and the success of our business in the long term is a function of the value we deliver to our customers and their employees and we believe we are delivering more value than ever before in fact we believe that castlight health benefits platform should be central to every selfinsured employers benefit strategywith that said let me now turn to specific progress in q and  overall during q we were pleased to see further sales of our newest products – castlight action and castlight elevate and we have now successfully completed our initial customer launches of both products as we have described before action uses its predictive analytics to segment and target particular subpopulations of employees to engage them selectively and encourage them to take actions that are cost efficient and beneficial to the enterprise and to the employee this kind of engagement is exactly what benefit leaders  need to make their benefit strategy successful our initial implementations have gone very well with the results that reinforced our belief that action is a musthave capability for all employers looking to engage employees more actively
