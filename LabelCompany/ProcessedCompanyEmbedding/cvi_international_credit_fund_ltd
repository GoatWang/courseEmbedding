including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in developing markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and can reduce returns because the fund may invest its assets in companies in a specific region including europe it is subject to greater risks of adverse developments in that region andor the surrounding regions than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically current political and financial uncertainty surrounding the european union may increase market volatility and the economic risk of investing in companies in europe derivatives including currency management strategies involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses as well as enable gains on an amount that exceeds the funds initial investment the fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised the funds risk considerations are discussed in the prospectus performance data represents past performance which does not guarantee future results current performance may differ from figures shown investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions and you may have a

than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average

fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search why shares of cvr energy declined  in may the operating environments for its subsidiaries  oil refiner cvr refining and nitrogen fertilizer producer cvr partners  continue to deteriorate and their dividends provide all of its profits tyler crowe tmfdirtybird jun   at am what happened shares of cvr energy nysecvi dropped  in may while there was no news directly related to the company the operating environments for cvrs two subsidiary partnerships  oil refiner cvr refining nysecvrr and nitrogen fertilizer producer cvr partners nyseuan  both remain weak which is seriously reducing the amount of cash moving to the parent company so what both cvr refining and cvr partners are master limited partnerships with variablerate distributions this means that their payouts each quarter depend on how much cash came in the door that quarter minus any cash reserved for maintenance or future expenditures lately market conditions for both have been so poor that cvr refining hasnt paid a distribution in more than a year and cvr partners payout has declined from  per share  months ago to just  per share today  image source getty images this puts cvr energy in a tight spot because it pays a consistent dividend of  per share  the last time it changed was in the first quarter of  since the only cash that cvr energy generates is through its ownership stakes in these two partnerships though the cash coming in the door hasnt nearly been enough to cover the dividend payments going out the parent organization has tapped its own cash reserves to cover dividends for several quarters in a row but this obviously isnt sustainable  cvi data by ycharts now what the one thing that could save cvr energy right now is a material improvement in either cvr refinings or cvr partners results unfortunately neither looks likely to happen soon on the oil refining side of things we could see a modest improvement in margins this quarter as crude oil prices have slipped and refined product inventories are down slightly however it doesnt look as though those factors will provide enough of an improvement to turn cvr refining into a cash cow for cvr partners things look even worse the nitrogen fertilizer market is trying to work through a major disruption to the traditional order to the business cheap natural gas in the us has completely upended the market and created a surplus but higher cost sources have yet to shutter operations cvr partners is probably on the wrong side of this disruption as one of its facilities generates fertilizer products using petroleum coke instead of natural gas  all of these signs point to an eventual dividend cut at cvr energy its just a matter of how long management wants to wait before making it wall street has already priced a payout cut into the stock  its current dividend yield is  depending on how long management puts off the inevitable this stock could decline

bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose
