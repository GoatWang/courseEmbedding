alternative investments our professionals our investing philosophy our competitive advantage is derived from our disciplined application of our equity selection philosophy which is based on adopting a businessowner mentality this simple concept is the cornerstone of our investment philosophy and we apply this methodology consistently regardless of shortterm market events we emphasize the preservation of capital by investing in businesses we believe to be significantly undervalued we particularly emphasize the price we pay for the security as we believe that is the single greatest determinant of both expected return and expected risk discipline we seek good to great businesses that trade at a significant discount to our estimate of intrinsic value the intrinsic value of a company is determined by calculating the present value of the sum of the companys future cash flows we do not decide to buy sell or hold stocks based on some perceived belief in where the market or the economy is headed but instead based on how the intrinsic value of the business compares to the market price of the stock we buy hold or sell our stocks in much the same way we would evaluate a business for acquisition or retention in its entirety patience we believe that possessing a longterm view is absolutely necessary to invest successfully which we define as outperforming a benchmark over multiyear periods and growing longterm wealth our approach and structure give us the ability to base our decisions on our expected value of a business multiple years in the future rather than whether a companys next quarters earnings will beat expectations or whether the next tick of the stock price is up or down we believe having a client base which shares this longterm focus is a great advantage in accomplishing our objective perspective we strive to maximize return and we believe that the primary factor in achieving this goal is the safety of principal with a focus on minimizing the odds of a permanent loss of capital this mindset directs us to purchase stocks at a significant discount to our estimate of underlying intrinsic value our goal is to generate substantial gains when our analysis proves correct while minimizing downside risk if a particular investment thesis is flawed adhering to these principles often results in investment decisions that run counter to the general market psychology and reduces the process of purchasing and selling securities to a discipline rather than an art interested in speaking with us contact us today and let one of our

profile management team investment philosophy team ccp team advisory board portfolio current investments past investments contact us firm profile chicago capital partners ccp is a diversified private equity holding company established by kovitz investment group llc® kig® to take advantage of private equity investment opportunities kig has long followed the investment philosophy pioneered by benjamin graham and warren buffett which stresses fundamentals relating to key elements such as cash flow competitive position and quality of management these fundamental considerations are important in both the private and public equity markets until the formation of ccp kig did not have an appropriate investment vehicle to pursue opportunities for investing in privately held businesses and instead predominantly focused on publicly held companies taking a cue from buffett’s leadership of berkshire hathaway kig created ccp to take advantage of private market investment opportunities in companies bearing characteristics that kig historically sought in public marketsccp intends to make investments predominantly in lower middle market private companies while offering the flexibility to invest in other opportunities identified by ccp management structuring ccp as a holding company with a perpetual life rather than as a traditional private equity fund with a finite investment period purposefully aligns the interests of ccp management and its investors and is consistent with kig’s approach to investing an emphasis on capital allocation flexibility the creation of a margin of safety through an attractive purchase price and a focus on value creation over a long time horizon ccp team marc s brenner jd cpachief executive officertheodore j rupp mbapresidentleonard s grynsenior

breathe between both old and young from personal users to businesses and now even hospitals mobile phones have become an essential part of the modern eco system without one people have difficulty finding employment and leave themselves negatively exposed to emergencies the vast majority of american adults    now own a cell phone this has resulted in the massive growth of businesses supplying and supplementing this market of which itll is now becoming a key player with such immense growth in the industry and corporate giants dominating the arena we frequently see small companies either grow exponentially or get bought out before they become a threat this is where otc itll comes into play their goal is to deliver market disruptive products and pricing to the millions of consumers who are looking for better deals in the mobile phone and application space since itll is a public company we believe this is an excellent opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the booming industry we’ve done some digging and have laid out  reasons why we believe itll may be the most profitable stock play of  breaking news itll successfully closes acquisition with completion of definitive agreements owcp   massive telecom acquisitions are happening all the time theyre so common in fact we barely notice the billions of dollars that are flying between these massive corporations month after month for example in  alone weve already seen several major acquisitions telecom service provider gtt communications announced in june that it plans to buy network connectivity provider global capacity for  million in cash and  million shares of gtt common stock we also saw that in april windstream announced its plan to acquire cloudbased unified communications provider broadview networks in an allcash transaction worth  million and if that isnt enough in march zayo group holdings inc closed its  billion acquisition of electric lightwave the company formerly known as integra telecom all of this happened in just the last few monthsall this makes you wonder why this is happening and whether itll has what it takes to dance with the big guys well it is our belief that the telecom giants scoop up the smaller competitive companies because they are a danger to their business model big companies like verizon are making money hand over fist  why stop when you can just scoop up the competition and keep business going as usualitll has made it clear that their goal is to be affordable and disruptive a similar situation took place in canada some years ago when a company named wind mobile came into play over a few short years wind grew a massive user base simply because their plans were significantly cheaper than the competition recently shaw bought

“information” about publicly traded companies the “profiled issuers” we publish the information on our website americantechreportcom and in newsletters text message alerts audio services live interviews featured “research” reports on message boards and in email communications for specific time periods that are agreed upon between us and the profiled issuer and  or third party paying us our publication of the information is known as a “campaign” this information may be sent to potential investors at different times that are minutes hours days or even weeks apart typically the trading volume and price of a profiled issuer’s securities increases after the information is provided to the first group of investors therefore the later an investor receives the information the more likely it is that he will suffer trading losses if they purchase the securities of a profiled issuer late in a campaign we are paid to advertise the profiled issuers intelligent cloud resources inc american tech report has been hired by a third party golden island investments ltd for a period beginning on july th  and is scheduled to end on august th  to publicly disseminate information about itll via website and email we expect to be paid three hundred thousand dollars via a series of bank wire transfers over this period we will update any changes to our compensation we own zero shares of itll third parties paying us to market the profiled issuer we believe intend to sell their shares they hold while we tell investors to purchase during the campaign intelligent cloud resources inc is a penny stock that was illiquid little to no trading volume prior to our campaign and therefore these securities are subject to wide fluctuations in trading price and volume during the campaign the trading volume and price of the securities of each profile issuer will likely increase significantly because of the media exposure when the campaign ends the volume and price of the profiled issuer will likely decrease dramatically as a result investors who purchase during the campaign and hold shares of the profiled issuer when the campaign ends will probably lose most if not all of their investment the information we publish in the campaign is only a snapshot that provides only positive information about the profiled issuers the information consists of only positive content we do not

depending upon the particular circumstances of the campaign in certain cases we are compensated by the profiled issuers third party shareholders and  or other parties related to the profiled issuers

profiled issuers are high risk unstable unpredictable and illiquid which may make it difficult for investors to sell their securities of the profiled issuers we may hire third party service providers and stock promoters to electronically disseminate live news regarding the profiled issuers yet we have no control over the content of and do not verify the information that the profiled issuers andor third party service providers publish these third party service providers are likely compensated for providing positive information about the issuer and may fail to disclose their compensation to you if a profiled issuer is a sec reporting company it could be delinquent not current in its periodic reporting obligations ie in its quarterly and annual reports or if it is an otc markets pink sheet quoted company it may be delinquent in its pink sheet reporting obligations which may result in otc markets posting a negative legend pertaining to the profiled issuer at wwwotcmarketscom as follows i “limited information” for companies with financial reporting problems economic distress or that are unwilling to file required reports with the pink sheets ii “no information” which characterizes companies that are unable or unwilling to provide any disclosure to the public markets to the sec or the pink sheets and iii “caveat emptor” signifying buyers should be aware that there is a public interest concern associated with a company’s illegal spam campaign questionable stock promotion known investigation of a company’s fraudulent activity or its insiders regulatory suspensions or disruptive corporate actions if the information states that a profiled issuer’s securities are consistent with the future economic trends or even if your independent research indicates that you should

in unforeseen ways and be affected by behavioral biases that we are unable to predict c human and social factors may outweigh future economic trends that we state may or will occur d clear cut economic predictions have their limitations in that they do not account for the fundamental uncertainty in economic life as well as ordinary life e economic trends may be disrupted by sudden jumps disruptions or other factors that are not accounted for in economic trends analysis in other words past or present data predicting future economic trends may become irrelevant in light of new circumstances and situations in which uncertainty becomes reality rather than predicted economic outcome or f if the trend predicted involves a single result it ignores other scenarios that may be
