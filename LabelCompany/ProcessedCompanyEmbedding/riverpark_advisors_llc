asset value over a period of negative performance since inception of the investment different indices and investments will experience drawdowns over different time periods however comparing max drawdowns over a common time period among multiple investments or indices provides a common basis for comparing two or more sets of data the max drawdown for a particular index may be different than the max drawdown presented if it were to include the entire period of such index’s existence rather than the period set forth above since the fund was converted from a partnership with only historical monthly performance the max drawdown is calculated based on monthly performance information down market performance is a metric used to evaluate risk it measures the average monthly performance of the fund as compared to the average monthly performance of the fund’s benchmark the sp  for the months in which the benchmark lost money gross exposure is calculated by adding the percentage of the funds equity invested in short sales to the percentage of its equity used for long positions net exposure takes into account the benefits of offsetting long and short positions and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of the funds equity capital invested in short sales from the percentage of its equity capital used for long positions the sharpe ratio is calculated by subtracting the riskfree rate  such as that of the month us treasury bill  from the rate of return for a portfolio and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns the above material is for
