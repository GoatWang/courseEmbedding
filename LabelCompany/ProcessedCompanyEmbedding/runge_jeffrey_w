–  administrator national highway traffic safety administration  –  clinical professor of emergency medicine jeffrey w runge has decades of clinical research leadership and administrative experience in addition to seven years as the head of two government agencies with as many as  employees and contractors under his direction he brings nearly  years of experience as an emergency medicine physician until  he practiced and taught in north carolina’s busiest emergency department and trauma center while performing research in injury prevention trauma care and emergency service delivery with government administrative experience and rich experience in ems and trauma management dr runge was a natural fit to become the department of homeland security’s dhs first chief medical officer where he led the reorganization of biodefense operations into a new office of health affairs to execute this mission dr runge and his team worked across traditional boundaries in government and the private sector to bring together various stakeholders in biodefense and medical preparedness on behalf of dhs  “biodefense is an enterprise with many stakeholders and responsible parties all of which must contribute to its success likewise the medical response to disasters is largely a private sector responsibility whether it is medical care delivery or the availability of countermeasures” dr runge says “i believe there are ample opportunities for the private sector to lead and take ownership in biodefense and medical preparedness and to profit from it” his leadership and innovation in road traffic safety brought him to washington as the head of nhtsa where he instituted programs that led to the first absolute declines in us motor vehicle deaths in nearly a decade and the lowest highway fatality rate in history his emphasis on safety belt use using the innovative “click it or ticket” program led to national belt use over  saving over  lives a year dr runge’s focus on rollover crashes using the star rating program and crash avoidance technology led to an industrywide redesign of suvs to improve their safety as family vehicles his expertise in road safety and emergency medical service delivery remains highly valued by government and the private sector dr runge is a  graduate of the university of the south sewanee tn and received his medical degree from the medical university of south carolina in  he has been honored by both institutions in recent years as a distinguished alumnus dr runge is board certified in emergency medicine and has published over  articles
