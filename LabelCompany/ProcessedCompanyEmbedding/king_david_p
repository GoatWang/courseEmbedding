jesse of the tribe of judah  he was a shepherd and psalm singer who for his fervent faith and courage in god challenged the giant goliath of the philistines to single battle and defeated him with just three smooth stones from his sling and the almighty power of the living god in whose honor and glory david fought  saul the first king of israel asked david to play his harp for him to soothe him but later became jealous of david and spent years trying to kill him god took the kingdom of israel away from king saul because of his lack of faithful service to him and gave it to david through the prophet samuel  king david ruled for many years in israel and fought many battles to preserve israel’s kingdom but because his hands were bloody from these battles and other imperfections god would not allow david to build him a temple but reserved this for his son king solomon  king david was the ancestor of jesus christ according to the flesh matt  luke   most of the book of psalms is attributed to this mighty and faithful warrior of god who remained a simple poet at heart the prophets     mounted icons  laminated prints  devotional items  books  audio  video  gifts  beautiful

shepard he was a pleasant and kind man and was well groomed even with his rough edges as a outdoors man gd said that king “david was a man after his own heart” which was fitting to be king of israel  samuel  ‘but now your kingdom shall not continue the lrd has sought out a man after his own heart and the lrd has commanded him to be prince over his people because you have not kept what the lrd
