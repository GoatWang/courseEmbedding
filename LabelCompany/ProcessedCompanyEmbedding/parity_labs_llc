and once received the replacement exchange or credit will be issued right away   do you test your products yes purity solutions is thegame changer in the research chemical industry all products are thoroughly tested by several of the most respected labs in the usa my product is colored why is this the products are colored for ease of recognition during the research process which aids in lab safety some laboratories  researchers include material recognition methods in their research protocols and color coding works very well for this although seen as not necessary by some most researchers prefer color coding systems and are pervasive in the laboratory environment  variations in color such as lighter darker shade variations do not constitute a change in formulation or quality concerns   standards in coloring applications are usually very consistent but occassionally slight shade variations may occur if different brands amounts or combinations of the coloring agents are used when mixing bulk solutions  this does not mean that any changes in concentration of raw material quality of active compounds notable changes in liquid or supension formulations or any other relative changes for research purposes is of concern  why does my order say offline after i check out when you place an order with purity solutions you will see a pending status when the order has been submitted  this means the payment and order information have been submitted to us but your card has not been charged at that time we need to have your civcvv verification number to manually process your order  this civcvv code needs to be put in the comments section when placing your order otherwise a purity solutions staff member will need to contact you via email or phone to get the verification code and your order cant be processed in standard time what updates should i receive after i submit my order when you submit your order a confirmation email will be sent with a copy of your invoice   when the order has been processed your card has been charged your order status will be changed to accepted and an email will be sent   when the shipping label has been created for your

has not been charged however your financial institution is showing a pending amount on your credit card statement this is normal this amount will drop off in    days according to the banking  credit institutions policy please remember it is only a pending charge it will not go through why have i not received my order confirmation email since emails are sent by our server automatically if you do

complete the checkout process edit your billing address with the proper information please keep in mind that your billing information and  digit code must be correct to the letter for the order to go

prototypting lots of small embeddedrobotic systems make extensive use of serial ports for communication between sensors actuators and a central processor of some sort despite this being one of the simplest interfaces one can work with it can still be a serious headache to initially set up debug and prototype with this tutorial is going to look at some handy tools you can use to make prototyping development and hardware configuration easier when using a serial port on a linux box port configuration most of the default behaviors for linux’s serial port functionality were chosen based on the assumption that the port would be used for communication with some kind of external modem or terminal application while the implementation is flexible enough to give you near complete control of the port these defaults can be disorienting for first timers one of the more annoying behaviors is line termination – depending on your particular os the serial port might be sticking new line or carriage return characters on the end of your packets without you realizing it weird things might also happen when your control program opens or closes the port ideally what you’re after is a ‘raw port’ one which sends only the exact character sequences specified there’s a few different ways to go about getting this behavior via c program from within a c program a serial port’s properties are set through the termios interface include include first obtain a file handle to the serial device based on the io characteristic desired int fd  opendevttyusb ordwr  onoctty  ononblock nonblocking int f d  opendevttyusb ordwr  onoctty  osync blocking then set up the control data structure and use it to set the baud rate for the port struct termios attrs cfsetispeedattrs b cfsetospeedattrs b set the control flags associated with desired port behavior no parity attrsccflag  parenb odd parity attrsccflag  parenb attrsccflag  parodd even parity attrsccflag  parenb attrsccflag  parodd one stop bit attrsccflag  cstopb two stop bits attrsccflag  cstopb set characterword size to n bits attrsccflag  csize attrsccflag  csn finally apply the settings structure to the port to commit the changes tcsetattrfd tcsanow attrs via command line you can also deal with this settings completely outside of your program which cuts down on added logic that doesn’t actually add to your controller be aware that each time you reboot the machine or addremove the usb device when applicable the settings are going to reset to set raw mode and a baud rate use the following command stty f devttys raw other options no parity parenb odd parity parenb parodd even parity parenb parodd one stop bit cstopb two stop bits cstopb set characterword size to n bits csn to set a port to  baud with even parity a  bit character size and two stop bits stty f devttys raw  stty f devttys parenb parodd cstopb cs check the stty man page for more information command line io echo when you’re first testing a new peripheral it’s a pain to have to write up a full program in order to send out a simple test string to see if the device works fortunately unix has a solution – echo echo is used to copy a string specified by the user to stdout or to some node like devttys that the user specifies using a pipe let’s say i wanted to print “hello world” to a file i would do so by echo hello world  somefile and now somefile will contain the string “hello worldn” echo can also be used to push arbitrary binary strings to a file don’t forget in unix my serial port is also a file let’s say i want to send a byte string of  xff xff x x x xd  out of devttys i can do this by writing some c code to push the characters or i can avoid reinventing the wheel and use echo echo n e xffxffxxxxd  devttys you’ll notice that two new command line switches were added to my echo call the first ‘n’ supresses the automatic newline that echo adds by default to the end of a string if i’m printing out to a serial port i almost certainly don’t want this behavior so i use ‘n’ to turn it off the second switch ‘e’ enables the intepretation of “backslash escapes” these are the format codes like “xff” that allow us to print nonascii characters that aren’t available on the keyboard you can read about all of them in the man page the one’s you’re most likely to use are xhh – specify a byte with hexadecimal value hh nnn – specify a byte with octal value nnn n – newline character equivalent to xa or  cat the flip side of echo an input handling program is cat cat will copy the contents of its input files to stdout you can use this with a serial port to view the activity on the line running the command cat devttys will print any activity on the serial port to your terminal screen unfortunately your terminal isn’t equipped to handle the nonprintable bytes that your serial device is probably sending to your machine to get a better look at things you can redirect cat’s output to a program that does hex formatting like so cat devttys  hexdump now you’ll get a hexadecimal printed version of your data instead a much more intuitive format for peripheral communication if you’d also like to save a copy of the data somewhere as it comes stream in you can use a neat little program called tee change your current cat command to cat devttys  hexdump  tee somefile and the file somefile will contain a copy of whatever cat processed in hex formatting if you remove the hexdump command from this chain the file will contain the raw data socat another painful part of developing for serial devices is unit testing the code most times the best way to really exercise code is with other bits of code – before you hook things up to your often expensive hardware it’s possible to do code testing using either files or pipes as an endpoint instead of your serial device but these mechanisms aren’t entirely symmetric in terms of their access mechanisms character files don’t track well – input and output tend to step on each other’s toes pipes on the other hand are unidirectional where a terminal endpoint is bidirectional forcing the io logic to fork at the front end and creating needless headaches how then does one achieve a reasonable simulation of the device from a file access standpoint then answer is tty emulation through socat socat socket cat is quoting the man page “a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams and transfers data between them” basically it lets you create all types of pipes sockets and other transport mechanisms for embedded systems work it incredibly useful for its ability to credibly fake a serial port pty the following command will create a pair of virtual ptys socat d d ptyechoraw ptyechoraw the program will print out the two end points it has created probably in devpts but that depends on your particular system to one of the end points you can hook your control program to the other you’ll have to hook up to something that can somewhat credibly fake the io characteristic of your test device – or you could just use the catecho combination from above the one hang up with this approach is that the actual ptys allocated are not always consistent – sometimes devpts will be allocated and sometimes devpts will be allocated this is a function of the state of the os as a whole and there’s not a lot you can do about it socat can however create links to the unreliably named pts nodes the links themselves will be in whatever location is specifed with the names requested to do this socat ptyechorawlinklink ptyechorawlinklink this will create link and link in the current directory that will point back to the underlying ptys if you’ve written your controller to use stdio to do its communication you can have socat invoke the program directly and connect the endpoint automatically to get this behavior do the following socat d d ptyechoraw execprognameptyechoraw socat’s command line can also be used to specify whatever configuration parameters the virtual ports might require the same type of behavior covered in the “port configuration” section above baud rate brate ex b no parity parenb odd parity parenbparodd even parity parenbparodd one stop bit cstopb two stop bits cstopb set characterword size to n bits csn ex cs the man page indicates that these options should work but the version of socat on my system would not accept them – your mileage may vary to create a port pair with  baud with no parity a  bit character size and two stop bits socat ptyechorawlinklinkbparenbcscstopb
