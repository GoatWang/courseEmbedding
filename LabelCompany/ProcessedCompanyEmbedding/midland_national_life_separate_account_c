and charges assessed against the contract are currently at levels below the guaranteed maximum levels we may increase these fees and charges up to the guaranteed maximum level effects of market timing frequent large programmed or shortterm transfers among the investment divisions harmful trading can cause risks with adverse effects for other contract owners and beneficiaries and portfolios these risks and harmful effects include  dilution of the interests of longterm investors in an investment division if transfers into the division are made at unit values that are priced below the true value or transfers out of the investment division are made at unit values priced higher than the true value some market timers attempt to do this through methods known as timezone arbitrage and liquidity arbitrage  an adverse effect on portfolio management such as causing the portfolio to maintain a higher level of cash than would otherwise be the case or causing a portfolio to liquidate investments prematurely or otherwise at an inopportune time in order to pay withdrawals and  increased brokerage and administrative expenses in addition because other insurance companies andor retirement plans may invest in the portfolios the risk exists that the portfolios may suffer harm from frequent programmed large or shortterm transfers among investment divisions of variable contracts issued by other insurance companies or among investment options available to retirement plan participants generally individuals or organizations that use markettiming strategies and make frequent transfers should use the investment divisions designed for markettiming strategies fee table the following tables list the fees and expenses that you will pay when buying owning and surrendering the contract the first

mixed and shared funding the funds will monitor for possible conflicts arising out of this practice if any such conflict or disadvantage does arise we andor the applicable fund may take appropriate action to protect your interests the fund portfolios available under the contracts are not available for purchase directly by the general public and are not the same as the mutual funds with very similar or nearly identical names that are sold directly to the public however the investment objectives and policies of the portfolios are very similar to the investment objectives and policies of other publicly available mutual fund portfolios that have very similar or nearly identical names and that are or may be managed by the same investment adviser or manager nevertheless the investment performance and results of any of the funds portfolios that are available under the contracts may be lower or higher than the investment results of such other publicly available portfolios there can be no assurance and no representation is made that the investment results of any of the available portfolios will be comparable to the investment results of any other portfolio or mutual fund even if the other portfolio or mutual fund has the same investment adviser or manager and the same investment objectives and policies and a very similar or nearly identical name the fund portfolios offered through the contract are selected by midland national based on several criteria including asset class coverage the strength of the managers reputation and tenure brand recognition performance and the capability and qualification of each sponsoring investment firm another factor that we consider during the selection process is whether the fund or one of its service providers eg the investment advisor will compensate us for providing administrative marketing and support services that would otherwise be provided by the fund the funds investment advisor or its distributor see distribution of the contracts on page  you are responsible for choosing the fund portfolios and the amounts allocated to each that are appropriate for your own individual circumstances and your investment goals financial situation and risk tolerance since investment risk is borne by you decisions regarding investment allocations should be carefully considered and periodically reevaluated in making your investment selections we encourage you to thoroughly investigate all of the information regarding the fund portfolios that is available to you including each funds prospectus statement of additional informational information and annual and semiannual reports other sources such as the funds website or newspapers and financial and other magazines provide more current information including information about any regulatory actions or investigations related to a fund or portfolio you should monitor and periodically reevaluate your allocations to determine if they are still appropriate you bear the risk of any decline in the accumulation value of your contract resulting from the performance of the portfolios you have chosen we do not recommend or endorse any particular portfolio or portfolios and we do not provide investment advice availability of the portfolios we cannot guarantee that each portfolio will always be available for investment through the contracts we reserve the right subject to applicable law to make additions to deletions from or substitutions for the shares of a portfolio that are held in the separate account new or substitute portfolios may have different fees and expenses and their availability may be limited to certain classes of purchasers if the shares of a portfolio are no longer available for investment or if in our judgment further investment in any portfolio should become inappropriate we may redeem the shares of that portfolio and substitute share of another portfolio we will not substitute any shares without notice and prior approval of the sec and state insurance authorities to the extent required by the investment company act of  as amended or other applicable law amounts in our separate account the amount you have in each investment division is represented by the value of the accumulation units credited to your accumulation value for that investment division the value you have in an investment division is the accumulation unit value times the number of accumulation units credited to you amounts allocated transferred or added to the investment divisions are used to purchase accumulation units accumulation units of an investment division are purchased when you allocate net premiums or transfer amounts to that division accumulation units are sold or redeemed when you make a full or partial surrender or transfer amounts from an investment division and to pay the death benefit when the annuitant or an owner dies we also redeem units to pay for certain charges we calculate the number of accumulation units purchased or redeemed in an investment division by dividing the dollar amount of the transaction by the investment divisions accumulation unit value at the end of each valuation period if it is a business day if it is not a business day we will use the unit value on the next business day the number of accumulation units credited to you will not vary because of changes in accumulation unit values the accumulation units of each investment division have different accumulation unit values we determine accumulation unit values for the investment divisions at the end of each valuation period the accumulation unit value for each investment division is initially set at  accumulation unit values fluctuate with the investment performance of the corresponding portfolios of the funds they reflect investment income the portfolios realized and unrealized capital gains and losses and the funds expenses the accumulation unit values also reflect the daily asset charges which includes the mortality and expense risk charge and the administration fee and optional rider fees we deduct from our separate account some of which are based on your accumulation value at the beginning of each contract month the daily asset charge is currently at an effective annual rate of  for the basic contract only the charge shown on your base contract at issue is guaranteed for the life of your contract if you elect a rider combination with the maximum allowable mortality and expense risk charge for optional riders of  the current daily asset charge is  the charge shown on your base contract and rider contract at issue is guaranteed for the life of your contract additional information on the accumulation unit values is contained in the sai we own the assets of our separate account we own the assets of our separate account and use them to support your contract and other variable annuity contracts we may permit charges owed to us to stay in the separate account thus we may also participate proportionately in the separate account the assets in the separate account are equal to the reserves and other liabilities of the separate account may not be charged with liabilities arising out of our other business the obligations under the contracts are our obligations the income gains and losses realized and unrealized of the separate account are credited to or charged against

operations of another division our right to change how we operate our separate account we have the right to modify how we operate the separate account in making any changes we may not seek approval of contract owners unless approval is required by law we have the right to o add investment divisions to or remove investment divisions from our separate account o combine two or more divisions within our separate account o withdraw assets relating to our variable annuities from one investment division and put them into another o eliminate a portfolios shares and substitute shares of another portfolio of the funds or another openend registered investment company this may happen if the portfolios shares are no longer available for investment or if in our judgment further investment in the portfolio is inappropriate in view of the separate accounts purposes however if required we would first seek approval from the securities and exchange commission and the insurance regulator where the contract is delivered o end the registration of our separate account under the investment company act of  o operate our separate account under the direction of a committee or discharge such a committee at any time the committee may be composed entirely of interested persons of midland under the investment company act of  o disregard instructions from contract owners regarding a change in the investment objectives of the portfolio or the approval or disapproval of an investment advisory contract we would do so only if required by state insurance regulatory authorities or otherwise pursuant to insurance law or regulation and o operate our separate account or one or more of the investment divisions in any other form the law allows including a form that allows us to make direct investments in addition we may disapprove any change in investment advisors or investment policies unless a law or regulation provides differently if any changes are made that result in a material change in the underlying investments of any investment division then you will be notified we may for example cause the investment division to invest in a mutual fund other than or in addition to the current portfolios you may want to transfer the amount in that investment division as a result of changes we have made if you do wish to transfer the amount you have in that investment division to another division of our separate account then you may do so without charge by writing to our principal office at the same time you may also change how your net premiums are allocated detailed

times on page  for more information on calculating the next available accumulation unit value based on the type of investment division selected in your application there may be delays in our receipt of applications that are outside of our control because of the failure of the selling agent to forward the application to us promptly or because of delays in determining that the contract is suitable for you any such delays will affect when your contract can be issued and when your premium payment is allocated among the investment divisions of our separate account we offer variable annuity contracts that have different death benefits contract features and optional benefits however these other contracts also have different charges that would affect your investment performance and accumulation value to obtain more information about these other contracts contact our principal office free look you generally have a day free look period after you receive your contract you may review it and decide whether to keep or cancel it if you cancel the contract then you must return it to the agent who sold it to you or to our principal office if you cancel your contract then we will

you in the contract application taxfree section  exchanges you can generally exchange one annuity contract for another in a taxfree exchange under the section  of the internal revenue code before making an exchange you should compare both annuities carefully remember that if you exchange another annuity for the one described in this prospectus you might have to pay a surrender charge on your old annuity and there will be a new surrender charge period for this contract and other charges may be higher or lower and the benefits may be different you should not exchange another annuity for this one unless you determine after knowing all the facts that the exchange is in your best interest and not just better for the person trying to sell you this contract that person will generally earn

instructions we reserve the right to limit the number of investment divisions in which you can have funds invested changing your premium allocation percentages you may change the allocation percentages of your premiums by writing to our principal office and telling us what changes you wish to make these changes will effect transactions as of the date we receive your request at our principal office changing your allocation instructions will not change the way your existing contract fund is apportioned among the investment divisions while the dollar cost averaging dca program is in effect the allocation percentages that apply to any premiums received will be the dca allocation percentages unless you specify otherwise see dollar cost averaging on page  optional riders there are several optional riders available under this contract for an additional charge with some restrictions noted in the descriptions below you may elect a combination of these riders as long as the additional mortality and expense risk charge for the combination of riders does not exceed  so the total asset charge cannot exceed  currently in addition if you elect the five for life plus rider the mortality and expense risk charge could change if you elect to stepup your gpb this stepup may cause the total current rider charges to exceed  some of the optional riders cannot be terminated once elected therefore you should review and select optional riders carefully five for life plus rider if you elect the five for life plus rider we guarantee that each contract year you may take withdrawals up to an amount equal to the gpa until your gpb is depleted even if your accumulation value reduces to zero this rider also provides for an alternate guarantee during the life of the covered person oldest owner specified under this rider this alternate benefit guarantees that each contract year during the life of the covered person you may take withdrawals up to an amount equal to the lpa even if your accumulation value and gpb reduce to zero the lpa is only available after the covered person has reached age  both the gpa and lpa may increase with each premium payment and may be reduced if withdrawals within a contract year exceed either the gpa or lpa the gpa lpa and gpb can increase by a bonus amount for the first five years after election of the rider for each contract year in which no withdrawal is taken during the first five years after the rider is issued a  bonus credit will be added to the gpb and could adjust the gpa and lpa however if total withdrawals in any of the first five contract years exceed the gpa then the bonus credit provision will be terminated and no future bonus credits will be received if the five for life plus rider is elected with the extra credit rider the gpb will reflect the premium bonus see extra credit rider on page  for more information if either the total gpa or lpa is not withdrawn in any contract year this amount will not carry over for withdrawals in future years this rider can be elected at issue or on any contract anniversary in exchange for this benefit we will deduct an extra daily mortality and expense charge at an annual rate that is  however the charge shown on your base contract when this rider is elected is guaranteed for the life of your contract unless you elect to stepup your gpb this charge is assessed against your separate account accumulation value the charges for this rider are listed in the fee table on page  the gpa and lpa will be different calculated amounts when you make a withdrawal you do not need to specify whether it is a gpa or lpa withdrawal if the withdrawal taken in a contract year does not exceed the lpa neither the lpa nor gpa will be recalculated if the withdrawal taken exceeds the lpa but not the gpa the lpa could be reduced and the gpa will remain the same value if the withdrawal taken exceeds both the gpa and lpa both the gpa and lpa could be reduced anything withdrawn up to the gpa or lpa is considered a penalty free withdrawal if the payment amount exceeds the  penalty free amount any surrender charges will be waived up to the gpa or lpa if the payment amount exceeds the  penalty free withdrawal amount and the requested withdrawal exceeds the gpa or lpa surrender charges will be applied on the withdrawal amount that exceeds the gpa or lpa stepup provisions after the rider has been inforce for five consecutive contract years and after every fifth contract anniversary thereafter you have the option to stepup the gpb you may stepup this rider until the earlier of the covered persons age  or the th contract anniversary after this rider is elected this allows you to increase the gpb to equal the current accumulation value as of the eligible contract anniversary date you have  calendar days after each eligible contract anniversary to notify us in writing or via facsimile that you have chosen this option we will not accept any request to exercise the stepup benefit after the th calendar day following any eligible anniversary you may not exercise the option to stepup if your current gpb is higher than your current accumulation value the guaranteed maximum rider charge noted in the fee table only applies to the initial purchase of the rider it does not apply if you elect to stepup the gpb at the time you elect to stepup we may be charging more or less for this rider regardless of when you purchased the rider we will charge you the current charge at the time you elect to stepup your gpb before you decide to stepup you should request a current prospectus which will describe the current charge for this benefit upon a stepup of the gpb the gpa will equal the greater of  the current gpa before the stepup of the gpb or   multiplied by the gpb immediately after the stepup upon a stepup of the gpb the lpa will equal the greater of  the current lpa before the stepup of the gpb or   multiplied by the gpb immediately after the stepup withdrawal provisions if total withdrawals during a contract year are less than or equal to the gpa then the gpb will decrease by the amount of the withdrawals if total withdrawals during a contract year exceed the gpa then the gpb will be automatically reset to equal the lesser of  the contracts accumulation value after the withdrawal or  the gpb prior to the withdrawal minus the amount of the withdrawal if total withdrawals during a contract year are less than or equal to the gpa then the gpa does not change as a result of the withdrawal if a withdrawal causes total withdrawals during a contract year to exceed the gpa then the gpa will become the lesser of  the gpa prior to the withdrawal or   multiplied by the greater of  the contract accumulation value immediately after the withdrawal or  the gpb immediately after the withdrawal as calculated in the gpb withdrawal provision if total withdrawals during a contract year are less than or equal to the lpa then the lpa does not change as a result of the withdrawal if a withdrawal causes total withdrawals during a contract year to exceed the lpa then the lpa will become the lesser of  the lpa prior to the withdrawal or   multiplied by the greater of  the contract accumulation value immediately after the withdrawal or  the gpb immediately after the withdrawal as calculated in the gpb withdrawal provision premium payment provisions each time an additional premium is received the gpa will equal the greater of  the current gpa before the premium or  the lesser of   multiplied by the gpb after the premium or  the current gpa before the premium plus the premium payment including premium bonus if any multiplied by  each time an additional premium is received the lpa will equal the greater of  the current lpa before the premium or  the lesser of   multiplied by the gpb after the premium or  the current lpa before the premium plus the premium payment including extra credit if any multiplied by  bonus credit provisions applies to the first five contract years after election of the five for life plus rider at the end of each contract year in which a withdrawal was not taken the gpb amount is increased by an amount equal to  of the original gpb unless there were withdrawals in any contract year that exceeded the gpa upon the gpb being increased by a bonus credit the gpa will equal the greater of  the current gpa before the bonus credit or   multiplied by the gpb immediately after the bonus credit upon the gpb being increased by a bonus credit the lpa will equal the greater of  the current lpa before the bonus credit or   multiplied by the gpb immediately after the bonus credit see appendix i on page  for examples of how the five for life plus rider works under this rider we reserve the right to restrict investment divisions at any time if an investment division is restricted no transfers into the restricted investment divisions will be allowed and no premiums may be allocated to the restricted investment divisions after the date of the restriction any amounts previously allocated to an investment division that is subsequently restricted will be unaffected by such restrictions there are no current investment division restrictions we guarantee that if your contract is issued when there are no investment division restrictions no investment division restrictions are guaranteed for the life of your contract under this rider we also reserve the right to limit the actual percentages allocated to certain investment divisions to require that certain investment divisions be chosen in conjunction with other investment divisions to limit transfers between existing investment divisions andor to require periodic rebalancing of existing investment divisions to the required percentages there are no current allocation requirements we guarantee that if your contract is issued when there are no allocation requirements no allocation requirements are guaranteed for the life of your contract if you do not elect this rider when you purchase the contract you have days from any contract anniversary date to notify us in writing or via facsimile that you have chosen to elect this rider the gpb will be equal to the accumulation value as of the eligible contract anniversary date any transactions that have occurred between the eligible contract anniversary date and rider election date could affect the gpb gpa and lpa if your irs minimum required distribution amount exceeds your payment amount under the five for life plus feature you will be required to withdraw more than the five for life plus payment amount to avoid the imposition of a  excise tax causing a decrease in your gpb you should consult with and rely on your own tax advisor before purchasing the five for life plus rider with a qualified contract if you exercise the right to examine provision in the contract you will not receive any portion of the gpb from the five for life plus rider it is not clear i how gain is computed when a partial surrender is made and the gpb gpa or lpa is greater than your accumulation value or ii whether payments made after the contracts accumulation value is zero will be taxed as partial surrenders or as annuity payments similarly for qualified contracts we will apply the nonannuity rules for determining minimum required distributions meaning that a percentage of the value of all benefits under the contract will need to be withdrawn each year the value may have to include the value of enhanced death benefits and other optional contract provisions such as the five for life plus rider itself consult with and rely upon your own tax advisor prior to purchasing this rider see federal tax status on page  for a general description of the taxation of withdrawals and annuity payments this rider will terminate o upon death of the annuitant or an owner unless the contract is continued under a spousal continuation option spousal continuation allows a surviving spouse if named the beneficiary to continue receiving the gpa amount until the gpb is depleted or the spouse dies whichever occurs first and then the rider will terminate o if you write to us requesting termination of the rider or o if you surrender or annuitize your contract if the rider terminates in the middle of a contract year you will still have the right to withdraw your full gpa that year if the rider terminates for any reason other than a full surrender of the contract we will continue the charge against your accumulation value until the next contract anniversary date if you surrender your contract in the middle of a contract year the charge will terminate at that time so you will only pay a prorated proportion of the rider charge once this rider has terminated it cannot be elected again at a later date the maximum gpb for this rider is  the maximum issue ages are  for single annuitants or owners and age  for joint annuitants or owners we may consider exceptions to the maximum issue ages each request for age exceptions will be reviewed on a casebycase basis we reserve the right to request additional information in order to evaluate suitability for the annuitants or owners the five for life plus rider may not be elected in combination with the gmib plus or the estate planning riders extra credit rider if you select the extra credit rider you may choose between a   or  premium bonus amount at the time you apply for the contract we will apply a credit of   or  depending on the amount chosen to each premium payment that you make in the first contract year in exchange for this credit we will charge you an additional fee as shown in the table below   selected premium bonus current extra credit charge percent               this charge is applied against your separate account accumulation value each year during the first seven contract years over time the amount of the fees may exceed the amount of the premium bonus credited we expect to profit from the extra charge for this rider in general in order to receive a benefit from this rider the separate account must experience a certain level of positive performance over a number of years and the contract must not be surrendered during the first seven years generally the higher the first year premium and the higher the rate of return the more advantageous the extra credit rider becomes and vice versa because the charge associated with the extra credit rider will be assessed against the entire separate account value for the first seven contract years contract owners who anticipate making additional premium payments after the first contract year should carefully examine the extra credit rider and consult their financial adviser regarding its desirability note carefully that the charge will be assessed against the separate account accumulation value attributable to premium payments made in years one through seven but no premium bonus will be credited with respect to premium payments made anytime after the first contract year if you exercise the right to examine provision in the contract you will not receive any portion of the premium bonus amount generally in the event of death withdrawal annuitization or surrender of the contract in the first seven contract years you or your beneficiaryies will only be entitled to that portion of the premium bonus if any that has vested at the time the event occurs the amount vested will increase over the sevenyear period so that in contract years  you or your beneficiaryies will be entitled to  of the premium bonus amount however by current company practice upon death of an owner or annuitant in the first seven contract years the vesting schedule will not be applied and your beneficiaryies will receive the full bonus amount this is not guaranteed however if your contract is issued while this company practice is in effect we guarantee that you will receive this company practice for the life of your contract the vesting schedule for the extra credit rider is shown in the table below vesting of bonus schedule contract year amount of extra credit vested     of premium bonus amount   of premium bonus amount   of premium bonus amount   of premium bonus amount   of premium bonus amount   of premium bonus amount   of premium bonus amount   of premium bonus amount this vesting schedule does not apply and no bonus recapture will be taken from withdrawals made under the free surrender amount provision of your contract keep in mind all withdrawals are taken on a first in first out basis which means withdrawals will be taken from the first premium received by us and then the second premium received if any and so on until the total withdrawal amount is reached any withdrawals taken from premiums received in the first contract year will only be entitled to that portion of the premium bonus if any that has vested at the time the withdrawal is taken the internal revenue code generally requires that any interest in a qualified contract be nonforfeitable and it is unclear whether the optional extra credit rider is consistent with those requirements consult a tax advisor before purchasing this rider as part of a qualified contract the extra credit rider may not be elected in combination with the shortened cdsc rider gmib plus guaranteed minimum income and accumulation benefit rider if you elect the gmib plus rider we guarantee that after the rider has been inforce for at least  years we will pay you a guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib if you elect to annuitize your contract and on the th contract anniversary after the rider has been inforce your accumulation value will be increased to equal the guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab if it is higher than your accumulation value this rider can be elected at the time of issue or on any contract anniversary after issue for an additional charge the rider must be inforce for a minimum of  years before any benefit is available the current charge for this rider is  of accumulation value per year the charge shown on your base contract when this rider is elected is guaranteed for the life of your contract on the th contract anniversary after this rider has been inforce and only on this date your contracts accumulation value will be increased to the gmab if your contracts accumulation value is less than the gmab on that date if the rider is elected at issue the initial gmab will equal the initial premium payment if this rider is elected along with the extra credit rider at the time of issue the gmab will reflect the premium bonus credited to your contract if the gmab is elected at a later date the initial gmab is equal to the current accumulation value the gmab on the th contract anniversary after this rider has been inforce will equal  initial gmab plus  subsequent premium payments after rider election if any minus  adjustments for partial surrenders after rider election if any the gmab adjustment for partial surrenders is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis each time a partial surrender is taken until there is a reduction of  of the accumulation value as of the contracts last anniversary if the total partial surrenders in any one contract year exceed the  reduction level the partial surrender amount above this level will reduce the gmab benefit by the same proportion that the partial surrender amount above the  level reduced the accumulation value at the time the partial surrender was taken if you must take irs minimum required distributions before the rider has been inforce for ten years your gmab amount will be reduced consult with and rely on your own tax advisor if you are considering purchasing this rider with a qualified contract if the rider is elected at issue the initial gmib accumulated value will equal the initial premium payment if this rider is elected along with the extra credit rider at the time of issue the gmib accumulated value will reflect the premium bonus credited to your contract if the gmib is elected at a later date the initial gmib accumulated value is equal to the current accumulation value if you elect to annuitize your contract anytime after the  year waiting period then except with respect to certain investment divisions as noted below the gmib accumulated value will equal the greater of  the gmib rollup benefit or  the gmib annual stepup benefit gmib rollup benefit means the initial gmib accumulated value at the time this rider is issued compounded at a rate of  annually until the contract anniversary after the earlier of the owners or annuitants th birthday the gmib rollup benefit is increased each time a premium payment is received after the date the rider is issued and is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis each time a partial surrender is taken until there is a reduction of  of the accumulation value as of the contracts last anniversary if the total partial surrenders in any one contract year exceed the  reduction level the partial surrender amount above this level will reduce the gmib rollup benefit by the same proportion that the partial surrender amount above the  level reduced the accumulation value at the time of the partial surrender the gmib annual stepup benefit equals the initial gmib accumulated value at the time this rider is elected the gmib annual stepup benefit is recalculated on the first contract anniversary after rider election and every contract anniversary thereafter until the contract anniversary after the owners or annuitants th birthday the annual stepup benefit on each contract anniversary is the greater of the current annual stepup benefit or the accumulation value on that contract anniversary the current annual stepup benefit is the previous anniversary stepup benefit adjusted for any premiums and withdrawals that have occurred over the contract year the annual stepup benefit calculated on the contract anniversary applies until the next contract anniversary or until you make a subsequent premium payment or partial surrender at which time it will recalculate any subsequent premium payments will immediately increase the annual stepup benefit any partial surrender will immediately decrease the annual stepup benefit the annual stepup benefit is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis each time a partial surrender is taken until there is a reduction of  of the accumulation value as of the contracts last anniversary if the total partial surrenders in any one contract year exceed the  reduction level the partial surrender amount above this level will reduce the gmib stepup benefit by the same proportion that the partial surrender amount above the  level reduced the accumulation value at the time the partial surrender was taken the partial surrender decrease on the annual stepup benefit could be more or less than the dollar amount withdrawn certain investment divisions within the separate account will have a  rate for determining the gmib rollup benefit there is no rollup for money allocated to these divisions if money is allocated in an investment division with a  rate

income payment upon annuitization of your contract under the terms of this rider and is not an accumulation value that can be withdrawn as a full or partial surrender however the gmab is a value that

equals the transfer minimum see the definition of business day and valuation period in the definitions section on page  see transaction cutoff times above after annuitization the maturity date you can make only two transfers per contract year we reserve the right to terminate modify andor severely restrict the transfer privilege in any manner we deem appropriate for some all or specific contract owners if required by our business judgment or in accordance with applicable law transfer limitations frequent large programmed or shortterm transfers among investment divisions such as those associated with market timing transactions can adversely affect the portfolios and the returns achieved by contract owners in particular such transfers may dilute the value of the portfolios shares interfere with the efficient management of the portfolios investments and increase brokerage and administrative costs of the portfolios in order to try to protect our contract owners and the portfolios from potentially harmful trading activity we have implemented certain market timing policies and procedures the market timing procedures our market timing procedures are designed to detect and prevent frequent or shortterm transfer activity among the investment divisions of the separate account that may adversely affect other contract owners or portfolio shareholders more specifically currently our market timing procedures are intended to detect potentially harmful trading or transfer activity by monitoring for any two interfund transfer requests on a contract within a five business day period in which the requests are moving to and from identical subaccounts for example a transfer from american century vp income  growth fund to van kampen uif emerging markets debt portfolio followed by a transfer from van kampen uif emerging markets debt portfolio back to american century vp income  growth fund within five business days we review transfer requests daily blotters and transaction logs in an attempt to identify transfers that exceed these transfer parameters when we identify a second trade within five days of the first we will review those transfers and other transfers in the same contract to determine if in our judgment the transfers are part of a market timing strategy or otherwise have the potential to be harmful we will honor and process the second transfer request but if we believe that the activity is potentially harmful we will suspend that contracts transfer privileges and we will not accept another transfer request for  business days we will attempt to inform the contract owner or registered representative by telephone that their transfers have been deemed potentially harmful to others and that their transfer privilege is suspended for  days if we do not succeed in reaching the contract owner or registered representative by phone we will send a letter by first class mail to the contract owners address of record in addition to our own market timing procedures managers of the investment portfolios might contact us if they believe or suspect that there is market timing or other potentially harmful trading and if so we will take appropriate action to protect others in particular we may and we reserve the right to reject or reverse a potentially harmful transfer if so we will inform the contract owner andor registered representative the contract owner will bear any investment loss involved in a reversal to the extent permitted by applicable law we reserve the right to delay or reject a transfer request at any time that we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of any of the portfolios available through separate account c because of any refusal or restriction on purchases or redemptions of their shares on the part of the managers of the investment portfolios as a result of their own policies and procedures on market timing activities or other potentially abusive transfers if this occurs we will attempt to contact you by telephone for further instructions if we are unable to contact you within  business days after we have been advised that your transfer request has been refused or delayed by the investment portfolio manager the amount intended for transfer will be retained in or returned to the originating investment division you should also be aware that we expect to be contractually obligated to prohibit transfers by contract owners identified by a portfolio and to provide contract owner transaction data to the portfolios you should read the prospectuses of the portfolios for more details on their ability to refuse or restrict purchases or redemptions of their shares in our sole discretion we may revise our market timing procedures at any time without prior notice as we deem necessary or appropriate to better detect and deter frequent programmed large or shortterm transfers that may adversely affect other contract owners or portfolio shareholders to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements or to impose additional or alternate restrictions on market timers such as dollar or percentage limits on transfers we may change our parameters to monitor for a different number of transfers with different time periods and we may include other factors such as the size of transfers made by contract owners within given periods of time as well as the number of round trip transfers into and out of particular investment divisions for purposes of applying the parameters used to detect potential market timing and other potentially harmful activity we may aggregate transfers made in two or more contracts that we believe are connected for example two contracts with the same owner or owned by spouses or owned by different partnerships or corporations that are under common control etc we do not include transfers made pursuant to the dollar cost averaging program and portfolio rebalancing program in these limitations we may vary our market timing procedures from investment division to investment division and may be more restrictive with regard to certain investment divisions than others we may not always apply these detections methods or limitations to investment divisions investing in portfolios that in our judgment would not be particularly attractive to market timers or otherwise susceptible to harm by frequent transfers we reserve the right to place restrictions on the methods of implementing transfers for all contract owners that we believe might otherwise engage in trading activity that is harmful to others for example we might only accept transfers by original wet contract owner signature conveyed through the us mail that is we can refuse transfer requests submitted by phone facsimile email or by any other electronic means or overnight courier service we also reserve the right to implement and administer redemption fees imposed by one or more of the portfolios in the future without limiting the generality of the forgoing we do not intend to apply these frequent trading detection methods or restrictions to the rydex vt investment divisions because these investment divisions are designed for frequent transfers see the prospectuses for these portfolios for more information contract owners seeking to engage in frequent programmed large or shortterm transfer activity may deploy a variety of strategies to avoid detection our ability to detect and deter such transfer activity is limited by operational systems and technological limitations in addition the terms of the contract may also limit our ability to restrict or deter harmful transfers furthermore the identification of contract owners determined to be engaged in transfer activity that may adversely affect other contract owners or portfolios shareholders involves judgments that are inherently subjective accordingly despite our best efforts we cannot guarantee that our market timing procedures will detect every potential market timer some market timers may get through our controls undetected and may cause dilution in unit values for others we apply our market timing procedures consistently to all contract owners without special arrangement waiver or exception we may vary our market timing procedures among our other variable insurance products to account for differences in various factors such as operational systems and contract provisions in addition because other insurance companies andor retirement plans may invest in the portfolios we cannot guarantee that the portfolios will not suffer harm from frequent programmed large or shortterm transfers among investment divisions of variable contracts issued by other insurance companies or among investment options available to retirement plan participants surrenders you may withdraw all or part of your surrender value by sending us a written request at our principal office the surrender value is the separate account accumulation value less nonvested premium bonus if any minus any applicable surrender charges and annual maintenance fee in some states a premium tax charge may also be deducted surrenders may be restricted by a retirement plan under which you are covered partial surrenders from an investment division must be made in amounts of  or more except for systematic withdrawals described below and cannot reduce your accumulation value to less than  if a partial surrender results in less than  remaining then the entire accumulation value must be withdrawn for a full surrender you must send in your contract with your surrender request any applicable surrender charge nonvested premium bonus if any and any required tax withholding will be deducted from the amount paid in addition upon full surrender an annual maintenance fee and possibly a premium tax charge may be subtracted completed surrender requests received at our principal office are priced at the next available accumulation unit value see transaction cutoff times on page  we will generally pay the surrender amount from the separate account within seven days after we receive a properly completed surrender request in good order we may defer payment for a longer period only when o trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted as defined by the sec o the new york stock exchange is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closing o an emergency exists as defined by the sec as a result of which disposal of the separate accounts securities or determination of the net asset value of each investment division is not reasonably practicable or o for such other periods as the sec may by order permit for the protection of owners see when we pay proceeds from this contract on page  if we defer payment for  or more days then during the period of deferment we will pay interest at the rate required by the jurisdiction in which this contract is delivered unless you specify otherwise your partial surrender will be allocated among all investment divisions in the same proportion as your accumulation value bears to each investment division this allocation is subject to minimum amount requirements the surrender charge will be determined without reference to the source the investment division of the partial surrender the charge will be based on the length of time between premium payments and surrenders see surrender charges on surrenders on page  a surrender will generally have federal income tax consequences that can include income tax penalties and tax withholding you should consult your tax advisor before making a surrender see federal tax status on page  surrenders may be restored under certain types of qualified contracts if allowed the restoration will be effective as of the date that surrender proceeds are returned to midland national under certain types of retirement arrangements the retirement equity act of  provides that in the case of a married participant a surrender request must include the consent of the participants spouse this consent must contain the participants signature and the notarized or properly witnessed signature of the participants spouse these spousal consent requirements generally apply to married participants in most qualified pension plans including plans for selfemployed individuals that are considered employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of  erisa you should check the terms of your retirement plan and consult with a tax advisor before making a surrender see federal tax status on page  dollar cost averaging generally the dollar cost averaging dca program enables you to make monthly or quarterly transfers of a predetermined dollar amount from the dca source account any investment division into one or more of the investment divisions the dca program may reduce the impact of market fluctuations by allocating monthly or quarterly as opposed to allocating the total amount at one time since we transfer the same dollar amount to investment divisions each month or quarter more units of an investment division are purchased if the value of its unit is low and fewer units are purchased if the value of its unit is high therefore a lower than average value per unit may be achieved over the long term however we cannot guarantee this this plan of investing does not insure a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets and you should consider your tolerance for investing through periods of fluctuating price levels the minimum monthly or quarterly amount to be transferred using dca is  you can elect the dca program at any time you must complete the proper request forms and send them to our principal office and there must be a sufficient amount in the dca source account you can get a sufficient amount by paying a premium with the dca request form allocating premiums or transferring amounts to the dca source account copies of the dca request form can be obtained by contacting us at our principal office the dca election will specify o the dca source account from which transfers will be made o that any money received with the form is to be placed into the dca source account o the total monthly or quarterly amount to be transferred to the other investment divisions and o how that monthly or quarterly amount is to be allocated among the investment divisions the dca request form must be received with any premium payment you intend to apply to dca once you elect dca additional net premiums can be allocated into the dca source account by sending them in with a dca request form all amounts in the dca source account will be available for transfer under the dca program any net premium payments received while the dca program is in effect will be allocated using the allocation percentages from the dca request form unless you specify otherwise you may change the dca allocation percentages or dca transfer amounts twice during a contract year if it is requested when the contract is issued then dca will start at the beginning of the second contract month if it is requested after issue then dca will start at the beginning of the next contract month after the request is received dca will not begin until the end of the free look period dca automatically terminates on the maturity date you may stop the dca program at any time by sending us written notice we reserve the right to modify suspend or end the dca program by sending you one months written notice we may in the future offer additional investment divisions or withdraw any investment division from the dollar cost averaging program we do not charge any specific fees for you to participate in a dca program portfolio rebalancing the portfolio rebalancing option allows contract owners who are not dollar cost averaging to have us automatically reset the percentage of accumulation value allocated to each investment division to a preset percentage level on a monthly quarterly semiannual or annual basis the portfolio rebalancing option is subject to the transfer limitations portfolio rebalancing will not occur during the free look period if you elect this option then on the date of each month or quarter that is the same as your contract anniversary date we will transfer the amounts needed to rebalance the accumulation value to your specified percentages rebalancing may result in transferring amounts from an investment division earning a relatively high return to one earning a relatively low return portfolio rebalancing will remain in effect until we receive your written termination request we reserve the right to end the portfolio rebalancing option by sending you one months notice contact us at our principal office to elect the portfolio rebalancing option there is no charge for portfolio rebalancing systematic withdrawals the systematic withdrawal feature allows you to have a portion of the accumulation value withdrawn automatically these payments can be made only  while the annuitant or owner is living  before the maturity date and  after the free look period you may elect this option by sending a properly completed preauthorized systematic withdrawal request form to our principal office you may designate the systematic withdrawal amount or the period for systematic withdrawal payments you will also designate the desired frequency of the systematic withdrawals which may be monthly quarterly semiannually or annually see your contract for details on systematic withdrawal options and when each begins if the new york stock exchange is closed for regular trading on the day when the withdrawal is to be made then we will process your withdrawal at the unit value determined at the close of the next regular trading session of the new york stock exchange the deduction caused by the systematic withdrawal will be allocated proportionately to your accumulation value in the investment divisions you can stop or modify the systematic withdrawals by sending us a written request a proper written request must include the consent of any effective assignee or irrevocable beneficiary if applicable each systematic withdrawal must be at least  each request for withdrawal of amounts less than  will be reviewed on a casebycase basis we reserve the right to change the frequency of payments or discontinue payments if the payment is less than  upon payment we reduce your accumulation value by an amount equal to the payment proceeds plus any applicable surrender charge see surrender charges on surrenders on page  the surrender charge applies to systematic withdrawals in excess of the free surrender amount in the same manner as it applies to other partial surrenders the extra credit rider vesting schedule also applies by current company practice systematic withdrawals taken to satisfy irs required minimum surrenders and paid under a life expectancy option will not be subject to a surrender charge we reserve the right to change this practice in the future however if your contract is issued while this company practice is in effect we guarantee that you will receive this company practice for the life of your contract amounts withdrawn to comply with irs minimum distribution rules will reduce the amount available under the free surrender amount any systematic withdrawal that would equal or exceed the surrender value will be treated as a complete surrender in no event will the payment of a systematic withdrawal exceed the surrender value the contract will automatically terminate if a systematic withdrawal causes the contracts surrender value to equal zero see the five for life plus rider  on page  and gmib plus guaranteed minimum income and accumulation benefit rider on page  for additional information on withdrawals in excess of any guaranteed amounts to the extent if any that there is gain in the contract systematic withdrawals generally are included in the contract owners gross income for tax purposes as ordinary income in the year in which the withdrawal occurs and may be subject to a penalty tax of  before age   additional terms and conditions for the systematic withdrawal program are set forth in your contract and in the application for the program free surrender amount you may withdraw up to  of your accumulation value as of the most recent contract anniversary each contract year without incurring a surrender charge in each contract year in the first year the free surrender amount will be  of your initial premium generally if this option is not exercised or if less than  is withdrawn any unused amount will not be carried over to a subsequent contract year a withdrawal may have federal income tax consequences that can include income tax penalties and tax withholding see

are received within  days after we receive proof of death the death benefit will be paid as a lump sum calculated as of that date when a death benefit is paid on the death of the annuitant and a payment option is selected within  days after the annuitants death the payment option must be an annuity for the life of the payee or for a period extending no longer than the payees life expectancy and payments must begin within one year of the date of death when a death benefit is paid on the death of an owner or a joint owner and a payment option is selected the payment option must be an annuity for the life of the payee or for a period extending no longer than the payees life expectancy and payments must begin within one year of the date of death if the annuitant or an owner dies on or after the maturity date then any remaining amounts other than amounts payable to or for the benefit of the owners surviving spouse must be paid at least as rapidly as the benefits were being paid at the time of the annuitants or owners death other rules relating to distributions at death apply to qualified contracts if joint owners or joint annuitants die within  hours of one another they are considered to have died simultaneously and the eldest is presumed to have died first in the event of simultaneous death of the owner and an annuitant the owner is presumed to have died first and the owners beneficiary would be paid the death benefit if the oldest annuitant or an owner is less than age  at the time of issue the death benefit paid to the beneficiary will be the greatest of  the accumulation value when we receive due proof of death an election of how the death benefit is to be paid and any other documentation or forms required or   of the total premium payments made to your contract minus adjustments for partial surrenders adjustments for partial surrenders will reduce the death benefit in the same proportion that the partial surrender reduced the accumulation value at the time of the partial surrender if the oldest annuitant or owner is age  or older at the time of issue the death benefit paid to the beneficiary will be the accumulation value when we receive due proof of death an election of how the death benefit is to be paid and any other required documentation or forms if the annuitant or an owner dies on or after the maturity date we will pay any remaining amounts other than amounts payable to or for the benefit of the owners surviving spouse at least as rapidly as the benefits were being paid at the time of the annuitants or owners death other rules relating to distributions at death apply to qualified contracts death other rules relating to distributions at death apply to qualified contracts naming different persons as owner and annuitant can affect whether the death benefit is payable the amount of the benefit and who will receive it use care when naming owners annuitants and beneficiaries and consult your registered representative if you have questions premium taxes may be deducted from the death benefit proceeds and we may retain any nonvested portion of the premium bonus payment of death benefits in most cases when a death benefit is paid in a lump sum we will pay the death benefit by establishing an interest bearing account called the midland access account for the beneficiary in the amount of the death benefit we will send the beneficiary a checkbook and the beneficiary will have access to the account simply by writing a check for all or any part of the amount of the death benefit the midland access account is part of our fixed account it is not a bank account and it is not insured by the fdic or any other government agency as part of our fixed account it is subject to the claims of our creditors we receive a benefit from all amounts left in the midland access account charges fees and deductions surrender charges on surrenders we may deduct a surrender charge from any full or partial surrender including a surrender to effect an annuity and on systematic withdrawals that exceeds the free surrender amount this charge partially reimburses us for the selling and distributing costs of this contract these include commissions and the costs of preparing sales literature and printing prospectuses if the surrender charge is insufficient to cover all distribution expenses then the deficiency will be met from our surplus that may be in part derived from mortality and expense risks charges described below for the purpose of determining the surrender charge any amount that you withdraw will be treated as being from premiums first and then from investment income if any and without regard to allocations of premiums or surrenders among investment divisions premium payments are considered withdrawn in the order that they were received there is no surrender charge on the investment earnings if any withdrawn if you have elected the optional five for life plus rider and the gpa or lpa exceeds the  free surrender amount the entire gpa or lpa will be penalty free the length of time between each premium payment and surrender determines the amount of the surrender charge the charge is a percentage of the premiums withdrawn and equals length of time from premium payment surrender number of years charge                   at the time of withdrawal if your accumulation value is less than your net premium the surrender charge will still be assessed against the full remaining net premium amount see surrender charge on page  under midland nationals current company practice amounts withdrawn under the contract to comply with irs minimum distribution rules and paid under a life expectancy option will not be subject to a surrender charge we reserve the right to change this practice in the future however if your contract is issued while this company practice is in effect we guarantee that you will receive this company practice for the life of your contract amounts withdrawn to comply with irs minimum distribution rules will reduce the amount available under the free surrender amount mortality and expense risk charge we deduct a daily charge for mortality and expense risks at an effective annual rate that ranges from  up to  of the accumulation values in the separate account the amount of this charge is based on the accumulation value if your accumulation value is less than  the mortality and expense risk charge is  of the accumulation value if your accumulation value is equal to or greater than  but less than  the mortality and expense risk charge is  of the accumulation value if your accumulation value is  or more the mortality and expense risk charge is  of the accumulation value there are economies of scale with higher accumulation values expenses per policy dampen as a percentage of accumulation value this economy of scale is passed onto you by having a different charge based on the level of accumulation value at the beginning of each contract month the mortality and expense risk charge will be determined therefore the mortality and expense risk charge may vary from month to month depending on the accumulation value determined at the beginning of each contract month but is guaranteed never to be more than  on the base contract this charge compensates us for assuming certain mortality and expense risks and for certain expenses the investment divisions accumulation unit values and annuity unit values reflect this charge we expect to profit from this charge we may use the profit for any purpose including paying distribution expenses however the maximum range of this charge  to  is guaranteed for the life of the contract and may not be increased we will continue to deduct this charge after the maturity date if you select a variable annuity option the mortality risk we bear arises in part from our obligation to make monthly annuity payments regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual may live these payments are guaranteed in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in your contract this assures you that neither the longevity of the annuitant nor an unanticipated improvement in general life expectancy will have any adverse effect on the monthly annuity payments the annuitant will receive under the contract our obligation therefore relieves the annuitant from the risk that he or she will outlive the funds accumulated for retirement the mortality risk also arises in part because of the risk that the death benefit may be greater than the accumulation value we also assume the risk that other expense charges may be insufficient to cover the actual expenses we incur we may also use proceeds from this charge to cover distribution expenses and payments to third parties who provide advisory or other services to contract owners administration fee we deduct a daily administration fee equal to an annual percentage rate of each investment divisions average daily net assets the purpose of this charge is to compensate us for the expenses associated with administration of the contract and operation of the investment divisions and other expenses the administration fee can vary by investment division the current administration fee for all investment divisions is  if your contract is issued with the  administration fee we guarantee that this fee will not change for the life of your contract annual maintenance fee we deduct an annual maintenance fee of  on each contract anniversary on or before the maturity date we reserve the right to increase this charge however it will not exceed  per contract year however if your contract is issued while the  fee is in effect we guarantee that the annual maintenance fee each contract year will not be more than  for the life of your contract we waive the annual maintenance fee if your accumulation value is  or more on the contract anniversary this charge is for our record keeping and other expenses incurred in maintaining the contracts at the end of each contract year we deduct this charge proportionally from each investment division if the contract is surrendered during a contract year and the accumulation value is less than  then we will deduct the full annual maintenance fee for the current contract year at that time we will not deduct the annual maintenance fee in the event of annuitization or death we may reduce the annual maintenance fee for contracts issued in a manner that results in a savings of administrative expenses the amount of reductions will be considered on a casebycase basis and reflect our expected reductions in administrative expenses optional rider charges five for life plus rider we deduct an extra charge on a daily basis if you select the optional fife for life plus rider as a percentage at an annual rate of  of the value in the separate account the charge shown on your contract when this rider is elected is guaranteed for the life of your contract unless you elect to

investment divisions charges in the funds the funds charge their portfolios for managing investments and providing services the portfolios may also pay operating expenses each portfolios charges and expenses vary some portfolios may also impose redemption fees which we would deduct directly from your accumulation value see the funds prospectuses for more information premium taxes midland national will deduct from your accumulation value at surrender death or annuitization a charge for any premium taxes levied by a state or any other government entity premium taxes currently levied by certain jurisdictions vary from  to  this range is subject to change midland national currently deducts such charges from contracts issued in the states of south dakota wyoming maine and west virginia these states and jurisdictions are subject to change other taxes at the present time we do not make any charges to the separate account for any federal state or local taxes other than premium taxes that we incur which may be attributable to such account or to the contracts we reserve the right to make a charge for any such tax or economic burden resulting from the application of the tax laws pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th federal tax status introduction note we have prepared the following information on federal income taxes as a general discussion of the subject it is not intended as tax advice to any individual you should consult with and rely on your own tax advisor about your own circumstances we have included an additional discussion regarding taxes in the sai annuity contracts in general deferred annuities are a way of setting aside money for future needs like retirement congress recognized how important saving for retirement is and provided special rules in the internal revenue code for annuities simply stated these rules provide that generally you will not be taxed on the gain if any on the money held in your annuity contract until you take the money out this is referred to as tax deferral there are different rules as to how you will be taxed depending on how you take the money out and the type of contract  qualified or nonqualified discussed below you will generally not be taxed on increases in the value of your contract until a distribution occurs  either as a surrender or as annuity payments when a nonnatural person eg corporation or certain other entities other than taxqualified trusts owns a nonqualified contract the contract will generally not be treated as an annuity for tax purposes and any increase in the excess of the amount value over the investment in the contract during the taxable year must generally be included in incomethere are some exceptions to this rule and a prospective owner that is not a natural person should discuss these with a tax advisor qualified and nonqualified contracts if you invest in a variable annuity as part of an individual retirement plan pension plan or employersponsored retirement program your contract is called a qualified contract if your annuity is independent of any formal retirement or pension plan it is termed a nonqualified contract the tax rules applicable to qualified contracts vary according to the type of retirement plan and the terms and conditions of the plan qualified contracts are issued in connection with the plans listed below there is additional information about qualified contracts in the sai o individual retirement annuity ira a traditional ira allows individuals to make contributions which may be deductible to the contract o a roth ira also allows individuals to make contributions to the contract but it does not allow a deduction for contributions and distributions may be taxfree if the owner meets certain rules o corporate pension and profitsharing and hr  plan employers and selfemployed individuals can establish pension orprofitsharing plans for their employees or themselves and make contributions to the contract on a pretax basis o deferred compensation plan  plan certain governmental and taxexempt organization can establish a plan to defer compensation on behalf of their employees through contributions to the contract o under code section b payments made by public school systems and certain tax exempt organizations to purchase annuity contracts for their employees are excludable from the gross income of the employee subject to certain limitations however these payments may be subject to fica social security taxes a qualified contract issued as a taxsheltered annuity under section b will be amended as necessary to conform to the requirements of the code code section b restricts the distribution under code section b annuity contracts of  elective contributions made in years beginning after december    earnings on those contributions and  earnings in such years on amounts held as of the last year beginning before january   distribution of those amounts may only occur upon death of the employee attainment of age   disability severance from employment or hardship in addition income attributable to elective contributions may not be distributed in the case of hardship the contract contains death benefit features that in some cases may exceed the greater of the net premium payments or the accumulation value these death benefit features could be characterized as an incidental benefit the amount of which is limited in any pension profitsharing plan or b plan because the death benefit may exceed this limitation and its value may need to be considered in calculating minimum required distributions employers using the contract in connection with such plans should consult their tax advisor the internal revenue service has not reviewed the contract for qualification as an ira and has not addressed in a ruling of general applicability whether a death benefit provision such as the provisions in the contract comports with ira qualification requirements minimum distribution rules and eligible rollover distributions qualified contracts have minimum distribution rules that govern the timing and amount of distributions if you are attempting to satisfy these rules before the maturity date the value of any enhanced death benefit or other optional rider may need to be included in calculating the amount required to be distributed consult with and rely upon your tax advisor in addition the income for a specified period option may not always satisfy minimum required distribution rules consult with and rely upon your tax advisor before electing this option if your minimum required distribution amount exceeds your payment amount under the five for life plus rider you will have to withdraw more than the payment amount to avoid the imposition of a  excise tax causing a decrease in your guaranteed amount you should consult with and rely upon your tax advisor before purchasing the five for life plus rider with a qualified contract distributions before age   may be subject to a  penalty tax also distributions from qualified contracts are generally subject to withholding eligible rollover distributions from corporate pension profitsharing and hr  plans b plans and governmental  plans are subject to a mandatory federal income tax withholding of  an eligible rollover distribution is any distribution to an employee or employees spouse or former spouse as beneficiary or alternate payee from such a plan except certain distributions such as distributions required by the code distributions in a specified annuity form or hardship distributions the  withholding does not apply however to certain nontaxable distributions or if the employee chooses a direct rollover from the plan to a taxqualified plan ira or tax sheltered annuity or to a governmental  plan that agrees to separately account for rollover contributions diversification and distribution requirements the internal revenue code provides that the underlying investments for a nonqualified variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements in order to be treated as an annuity the annuity must also meet certain distribution requirements at the death of the annuitant or an owner in order to be treated as an annuity contract these diversification and distribution requirements are discussed in the sai midland may modify the contract to attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment owner control in certain circumstances owners of variable annuity contracts have been considered for federal income tax purposes to be the owners of the assets of the separate account supporting their contracts due to their ability to exercise investment control over those assets when this is the case the contract owners have been currently taxed on income and gains attributable to the variable account assets there is limited guidance in this area and some features of our contracts such as the flexibility of an owner to allocate premium payments and transfer amounts among the investment divisions of the separate account have not been explicitly addressed in published rulings while we believe that the contracts do not give owners investment control over separate account assets we reserve the right to modify the contracts as necessary to prevent an owner from being treated as the owner of the separate account assets supporting the contract required distributions at death nonqualified contracts in order to be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes section s of the code requires any nonqualified contract to contain certain provisions specifying how your interest in the contract will be distributed in the event of the death of an owner of the contract or the annuitant if the contract has a nonnatural owner section s generally requires that a if any owner dies on or after the annuity starting date but prior to the time the entire interest has distributed the entire interest in the contract will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of such owners death and b if any owner dies prior to the annuity starting date the entire interest in the contract will be distributed within five years after the date of such owners death these requirements will be considered satisfied if amounts are payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary and are paid over the life of such designated beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of that beneficiary provided that such distributions begin within one year of the owners death if the designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the deceased owner the contract may be continued with the surviving spouse as the new owner surrenders  nonqualified contracts if you purchase the contract as an individual and not under an individual retirement annuity or other qualified retirement plan your contract is referred to as a nonqualified contract if you make a partial surrender from a nonqualified contract before the annuity commencement date the internal revenue code treats that surrender as first coming from gain and then from your premium payments when you make a partial surrender you are taxed on the amount of the surrender that is gain if you make a full surrender you are generally taxed on the amount that your surrender proceeds exceed the investment in the contract which is generally your premiums paid adjusted for any prior partial surrenders that came out of the premiums the premium bonus will generally be considered gain the method for computing gain where a five for life plus rider or a gmib plus rider is added to your contract is unclear accordingly you should consult a tax adviser before adding either of these riders different rules apply for annuity payments see annuity payments below the internal revenue code also provides that surrendered gain may be subject to a penalty the amount of the penalty is equal to  of the amount that is includable in income some surrenders will be exempt from the penalty in general this includes any amount o paid on or after the taxpayer reaches age   o paid after an owner dies o paid if the taxpayer becomes totally disabled as that term is defined in the internal revenue code o paid in a series of substantially equal payments made annually or more frequently under a lifetime annuity o paid under an immediate annuity or o which come from premium payments made prior to august   pretefra special rules may be applicable in connection with the exceptions enumerated above you should consult with and rely on your tax advisor with regard to exceptions from the penalty tax multiple contracts all nonqualified deferred contracts that are issued by midland national or its affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year are treated as one annuity for purposes of determining the amount includable in the owners income when a taxable distribution occurs withholding distributions from qualified and nonqualified contracts are generally subject to withholding for your federal income tax liability the withholding rate varies according to the type of distribution and your tax status except with respect to eligible rollover distributions as described above you will be provided the opportunity to elect not to have tax withheld from distributions when allowed by law annuity payments although the tax consequences may vary depending on the annuity payment option you select in general for nonqualified and certain qualified contracts only a portion of the annuity payments you receive will be includable in your gross income in general the excludable portion of each annuity payment you receive will be determined as follows o fixed payments  by dividing the investment in the contract on the maturity date by the total expected value of the annuity payments for the term of the payments this is the percentage of each annuity payment that is excludable o variable payments  by dividing the investment in the contract on the maturity date by the total number of expected periodic payments this is the amount of each annuity payment that is excludable the remainder of each annuity payment is includable in gross income once the investment in the contract has been fully recovered the full amount of any additional annuity payments is includable in gross income if you select more than one annuity payment option special rules govern the allocation of the contracts entire investment in the contract to each such option for purposes of determining the excludable amount of each payment received under that option we advise you to consult a competent tax advisor as to the potential tax effects of allocation amounts to any particular annuity payment option if after annuitization annuity payments stop because the annuitant or an owner has died the excess if any of the investment in the contract as of the annuitization date over the aggregate amount of annuity payments received that was excluded from gross income is generally allowable as a deduction for your last taxable year annuity contracts purchased by nonresident aliens and foreign corporations the discussion above provided general information regarding us federal income tax consequences to annuity owners that are us persons taxable distributions made to owners who are not us persons will generally be subject to us federal income tax withholding at a  rate unless a lower treaty rate applies in addition distributions may be subject to state andor municipal taxes and taxes that may be imposed by the owners country of citizenship or residence prospective foreign owners are advised to consult with a qualified tax advisor regarding us state and foreign taxation for any annuity contract purchase taxation of death benefit proceeds amounts may be distributed from the contract because of the death of the annuitant or an owner generally such amounts should be includable in the income of the recipient o if distributed in a lump sum these amounts are taxed in the same manner as a full surrender or o if distributed under an annuity payment option these amounts are taxed in the same manner as annuity payments transfers assignments or exchange of contracts a transfer of ownership or absolute assignment of a contract the designation of an annuitant or payee or other beneficiary who is not also the owner the selection of certain maturity dates or a change of annuitant may result in certain income or gift tax consequences to the owner that are beyond the scope of this discussion an owner contemplating any such transfer assignment selection or change should contact a competent tax advisor with respect to the potential tax effects of such a transaction possible tax law changes although the likelihood of legislative changes is uncertain there is always the possibility that the tax treatment of the contract could change by legislation or otherwise you should consult a tax advisor with respect to legal developments and their effect on the contract economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of  the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of  egtrra repeals the federal estate tax and replaces it with a carryover basis income tax regime effective for estates of decedents dying after december   egtrra also repeals the generation skipping transfer tax but not the gift tax for transfers made after december   egtrra contains a sunset provision which essentially returns the federal estate gift and generationskipping transfer taxes to their preegtrra form beginning in  congress may or may not enact permanent repeal between now and then during the period prior to  egtrra provides for periodic decreases in the maximum estate tax rate coupled with periodic increases in the estate tax exemption for  the maximum estate tax rate is  and the estate tax exemption is  the complexity of the new tax law along with uncertainty as to how it might be modified in coming years underscores the importance of seeking guidance from a qualified advisor to help ensure that your estate plan adequately addresses your needs and that of your beneficiaries under all possible scenarios while no attempt is being made to discuss the federal estate tax implications of the contract a purchaser should keep in mind that the value of an annuity contract owned by a decedent and payable to a beneficiary by virtue of surviving the decedent is included in the decedents gross estate depending on the terms of the annuity contract the value of the annuity included in the gross estate may be the value of the lump sum payment payable to the designated beneficiary or the actuarial value of the payments to be received by the beneficiary consult with and rely on an estate planning advisor for more information under certain circumstances the code may impose a generationskipping transfer tax when all or part of an annuity contract is transferred to or a death benefit is paid to an individual two or more generations younger than the owner regulations issued under the code may require us to deduct the tax from your contract or from any applicable payment and pay it directly to the irs separate account charges it is possible that the internal revenue service may take a position that fees for certain optional benefits are deemed to be taxable distributions to you although we do not believe that the fees associated with any optional benefit provided under the contract should be treated as taxable surrenders you should consult your tax advisor prior to selecting any optional benefit under the contract annuity purchases by residents of puerto rico the internal revenue service recently announced that income received by residents of puerto rico under life insurance or annuity contracts issued by a puerto rico branch of a united states life insurance company is ussource income that is generally subject to united states federal income tax maturity date the maturity date is the last possible date on which income payments will begin under the annuity option you have selected the earliest possible maturity date under the contract is the th contract anniversary at which time you may annuitize your full accumulation value less any premium taxes however by current company practice we will allow you to annuitize the accumulation value less any nonvested extra credit and less any premium taxes after the rd contract year if you choose a life annuity or joint and survivor income annuity payment options and after the th contract year if at least a fiveyear certain period annuity option is elected benefits are not guaranteed and are subject to change however if your contract is issued while this company practice is in effect we guarantee that you will receive this company practice for the life of your contract the maximum maturity date is the contract anniversary immediately following the annuitants th birthday you may change the maturity date by sending written notice to our principal office we must receive your written notice at least  days prior to the original maturity date if you have not previously specified otherwise and have not elected certain systematic withdrawal options then on the maturity date you may  take the accumulation value in one lump sum or  convert the accumulation value into an annuity payable to the annuitant payee as described below electing an annuity option you may apply the proceeds of a surrender to affect an annuity payment option unless you choose otherwise on the maturity date your surrender value from the separate account will be applied to a  year certain and life variable payout the first monthly annuity payment will be made within one month after the maturity date variable payment options are not available in certain states currently the payment options are only available if the proceeds applied are  or more and the first periodic payment will be at least  we reserve the right to change the payment frequency so that payments are at least  the payees actual age will affect each payment amount for annuity payment options involving life income the amount of each annuity payment to older payees will be greater than for younger payees because payments to older payees are expected to be fewer in number for annuity payment options that do not involve life annuity the length of the payment period will affect the amount of each payment with a shorter period the amount of each annuity payment will be greater payments that occur more frequently will be smaller than those occurring less frequently the payee or any other person who is entitled to receive payments may name a beneficiary to receive any amount that we would otherwise pay to that persons estate if that person died the person who is entitled to receive payment may change the beneficiary at any time annuity payment options will be subject to our rules at the time of selection we must approve any arrangements that involve more than one of the payment options or a payee who is not a natural person for example a corporation or a payee who is a fiduciary or an assignee also the details of all arrangements will be subject to our rules at the time the arrangements takes effect this includes o rules on the minimum amount we will pay under an option o minimum amounts for installment payments surrender or commutation rights your rights to receive payments over time for which we may offer you a lump sum payment o the naming of people who are entitled to receive payment and their beneficiaries and o the ways of proving age gender and survival you choose an annuity payment option when you apply for a contract and may change it by writing to our principal office you must elect the payment option at least  days before the maturity date fixed payment options payments under the fixed options are not affected by the investment experience of any investment division if you elect a fixed payment option then the surrender value as of the maturity date will be applied to the fixed option selected we guarantee interest under the fixed options at a rate of  a year we may also credit interest under the fixed payment options at a rate that is above the  guaranteed rate this is at our complete discretion thereafter interest or payments are fixed according to the annuity option chosen variable payment options payments under the variable options will vary in amount depending on the investment experience of the investment divisions after the maturity date variable payment options are not available in certain states the annuity tables contained in the contract are based on a  five percent assumed investment rate this is a fulcrum rate around which variable annuity payments will fluctuate to reflect whether the investment experience of the investment divisions is better or worse than the assumed investment rate if the actual investment experience exceeds the assumed investment rate then the payment will increase conversely if the actual investment experience is less than the assumed rate then payments will decrease we determine the amount of the first monthly variable payment by applying the value in each investment division as of a date not more than  business days prior to the maturity date to the appropriate rate from the annuity tables in the contract for the payout options selected using the payees age and sex where permissible the amount of the first payment will then be used to determine the number of annuity units for each investment division the number of annuity units is used to determine the amount of subsequent variable payments the annuity unit value for each investment division will be initially set at  thereafter the annuity unit value will vary with the investment experience of the investment division and will reflect the mortality and expense risk charge we deduct at an effective annual rate based on your accumulation value at the time of annuitization charges for optional riders discontinue after the maturity date if your accumulation value is less than  the effective annual rate is  if your accumulation value is equal to or greater than  but less than  the effective annual rate is  if your accumulation value is  or more the effective annual rate is  the annuity unit value will increase if the net investment experience investment experience minus the asset charge is greater than the  assumed investment rate the annuity unit value will decrease if the net investment experience is less than the  assumed investment rate the amount of each subsequent variable payment will be determined for each investment division by multiplying the number of annuity units by the annuity unit value additional information on the variable annuity payments is contained in the sai that can be obtained for free by contacting us at our principal office payment options the following three payment options are available  income for specified period we pay installments for a specified period we will pay the amount applied in equal installments plus applicable interest excess interest may be paid at our discretion for a specified time from  up to  years fixed payment option only  payment of life income we will pay monthly income for life you may choose from  of  ways to receive the income a life annuity we will pay equal monthly payments during the lifetime of the payee with a life annuity payment option payments will only be made as long as the payee is alive therefore if the payee dies after the first payment then only one payment will be made b life annuity with certain period we will pay equal monthly payments for a selected number of guaranteed payments and then for as long as the payee is living thereafter  joint and survivor income we will make monthly payments until the last surviving payees death therefore if both payees die after the first payment then only one payment will be made the annuitant must be at least  years old and the beneficiarypayee must be at least  years old at the time of the first monthly payment transfers after annuitization for variable payment options after annuitization only two transfers per contract year may be made among the investment divisions generally for all investment divisions transfer requests received in good order at our principal office on any business day are priced at the next available accumulation unit value see transaction cutoff times on page  the transfer request must be received at least  business days before the due date of the first annuity payment to which the change will apply transfers after the annuity payments have started will be based on the annuity unit values there

same proportion as we vote shares for which we have received instructions in that portfolio we currently intend to vote any fund shares that we alone are entitled to vote in the same proportions that contract owners vote if the federal securities laws or regulations or interpretations of them change so that we are permitted to vote shares of the fund in our own right or to restrict owner voting then we may do so how we determine your voting shares you may participate in voting only on matters concerning the fund portfolios in which your accumulation value has been invested we determine your voting shares in each division by dividing the amount of your accumulation value allocated to that division by the net asset value of one share of the corresponding fund portfolio this is determined as of the record date set by the funds board for the shareholders meeting if you have a voting interest then we will send you proxy material and a form for giving us voting instructions in certain cases we may disregard instructions relating to changes in the funds adviser or the investment objectives and policies of its portfolios voting privileges of participants in other companies other insurance companies own shares in the funds to support their variable life insurance and variable annuity products we do not foresee any disadvantage to this nevertheless each funds board of directors will monitor events to identify conflicts that may arise and determine appropriate action if we disagree with any fund action then we will see that appropriate action is taken to protect our contract owners our reports to owners shortly after the end of each calendar year we will send a report that shows o your accumulation value and o any transactions involving your accumulation value that occurred during the year transactions include your premium allocations transfers and partial surrenders made in that year confirmation notices will be sent to you for premiums transfers of amounts between investment divisions and certain other contract transactions we also currently intend to send you semiannual reports with financial information on the portfolios dividends we do not pay any dividends on the contract described in this prospectus performance performance information for the investment divisions may appear in reports and advertising to current and prospective owners the performance information is based on the average annual total returns for one or more of the investment divisions based on the performance of a portfolio since the time the separate account commenced operations and does not indicate or represent future performance we may also use performance information for the investment divisions in reports and advertising to current and prospective owners that is based on the historical investment experience of the investment division and the portfolios and does not indicate or represent future performance total returns are based on the overall dollar or percentage change in value of a hypothetical investment standard total return quotations reflect changes in portfolio share price the automatic reinvestment by the separate account of all distributions and the deduction of applicable charges including any surrender charges that would apply if you surrendered the contract at the end of the period indicated quotations of total return may also be shown that do not take into account certain contract charges such as the surrender charge and the rider charges the total return percentage will be higher under this method than under the standard method described above a cumulative total return reflects performance over a stated period of time if the performance had been constant over the entire period then an average annual total return reflects the hypothetical annually compounded return that would have produced the same cumulative total return because average annual total returns tend to smooth out variations in an investment divisions returns you should recognize that they are not the same as actual yearbyyear results some investment divisions may also advertise yield these measures reflect the income generated by an investment in the investment divisions over a specified period of time this income is annualized and shown as a percentage yields do to not take into account capital gains or losses or the surrender charge or rider charges the standard quotations of yield reflect the annual maintenance fee the money market investment divisions may advertise their current and effective yield current yield reflects the income generated by an investment in the investment division over a day period effective yield is calculated in similar manner except that income earned is assumed to be reinvested other investment divisions may advertise a day yield which reflects the income generated by an investment in the investment division over a day period we may also advertise performance figures for the investment divisions based on the performance of a portfolio prior to the time the separate account commenced operations change of address notification to protect you from fraud and theft we may

consequences you may assign the contract by giving us written notice we will not be responsible for the validity of any assignment we will not be liable for any payments we make prior to recording the written notice of assignment accumulation unit value we determine accumulation unit values for each investment division of our separate account at the end of each business day the accumulation unit value for each investment division was initially set at  the accumulation unit value for any business day is equal to the accumulation unit value for the preceding business day multiplied by the net investment factor for that division on that business day we determine the net investment factor for each investment division every business day as follows o first we take the net asset value per share held in the investment division at the end of the current business day plus the per share amount of any dividends or capital gain distributions on shares held in the investment divisions on the current business day minus the per share amount of any capital loss realized or unrealized on shares held in the investment divisions on the current business day o then we divide this amount by the net asset value per share held in the investment division at the close of business on the preceding business day after giving effect to any contract transactions on that day o then we subtract a daily asset charge for each calendar day between business days for example a monday calculation may include charges for saturday sunday and monday the daily current charge for the basic contract without the optional riders is currently  which is an effective annual rate of  for contracts with an accumulation value between   which is an annual rate of  for contracts with an accumulation value between    and  for contracts with an accumulation value of  and over this charge is for mortality and expense risks assumed by us under the contract and to cover administrative costs we incur for transactions related to the separate account the daily charge for a contract with the maximum rider charges is currently  which is an effective annual rate of  for contracts with an accumulation value between     which is an annual rate of  for contracts with an accumulation value between    and  which is an annual rate of  for contracts with an accumulation value of  and over o finally we reserve the right to subtract any other daily charge for taxes or amounts set aside as a reserve for taxes generally this means that we would adjust unit values to reflect what happens to the funds and also for any charges annuity payments the amount of each fixed annuity payment will be set on the maturity date and will not subsequently be affected by the investment performance of the investment divisions the amount of each variable annuity payment will be affected by the investment performance of the investment divisions variable payment options are not available in certain states the dollar amount of the first monthly variable annuity payment is computed for each investment division by applying the value in the investment division as of a date not more than  business days prior to the maturity date to the appropriate rate for the payout option selected using the age and sex where permissible of the annuitant the number of annuity units for each investment division is then calculated by dividing the first variable annuity payment for that investment division by the investment divisions annuity unit value as of the same date the dollar amount of each subsequent payment from an investment division is equal to the number of annuity units for that investment division times the annuity unit value for that investment division as of a uniformly applied date not more than  business days before the annuity payment is due the payment made to the annuitant for the first payment and all subsequent payments will be the sum of the payment amounts for each investment division the annuity unit value for each investment division was initially set at  the annuity unit value for any business day is equal to  multiplied by  multiplied by  where   the annuity unit value for the preceding business day   the net investment factor as described above for that division on that business day   the investment result adjustment factor  per day which recognizes an assumed interest rate of  per year used in determining the annuity payment amounts transfers after the maturity date will only be allowed twice per contract year and will be made using the annuity unit value for the investment divisions on the date the request for transfer is received on the transfer date the number of annuity units transferred from the investment division is multiplied by the annuity unit value for that investment division to determine the value being transferred this value is then transferred into the indicated investment divisions by converting this value into annuity units of the proper investment divisions the annuity units are determined by dividing the value being transferred into an investment division by the annuity unit value of the investment division on the transfer date the transfer shall result in the same dollar amount of variable annuity payment on the date of transfer calculation of yields and total returns money market investment division yield calculation in accordance with regulations adopted by the securities and exchange commission midland national is required to compute the rydex vt us government money market fund investment division and the profund vp money market investment division collectively called the money market investment division for the purpose of this section current annualized yield for a sevenday period in a manner which does not take into consideration any realized or unrealized gains or losses on shares of the money market investment division or on their respective portfolio securities this current annualized yield is computed for the money market investment division by determining the net change exclusive of realized gains and losses on the sale of securities and unrealized appreciation and depreciation and income other than investment income in the value of a hypothetical account having a balance of one unit of the money market investment division at the beginning of such sevenday period dividing such net change in account value by the value of the account at the beginning of the period to determine the base period return and annualizing this quotient on a day basis the net change in account value reflects the deductions for the annual maintenance fee the mortality and expense risk charge and income and expenses accrued during the period because of these deductions the yield for the money market investment division of the separate account will be lower than the yield for the respective money market investment division or any comparable substitute funding vehicle the securities and exchange commission also permits midland national to disclose the effective yield of the money market investment division for the same sevenday period determined on a compounded basis the effective yield is calculated by compounding the unannualized base period return by adding one to the base period return raising the sum to a power equal to  divided by  and subtracting one from the result the yield on amounts held in the money market investment division normally will fluctuate on a daily basis therefore the disclosed yield for any given past period is not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of return the money market investment divisions actual yield is affected by changes in interest rates on money market securities average portfolio maturity of the money market investment division or substitute funding vehicle the types and quality of portfolio securities held by the money market investment division or substitute funding vehicle and operating expenses in addition the yield figures are for the base contract only with no rider charges and do not reflect the effect of any surrender charge that may be applicable to a particular contract other investment division yield calculations midland national may from time to time disclose the current annualized yield of one or more of the investment divisions except the money market investment division for day periods the annualized yield of an investment division refers to income generated by the investment division over a specified day period because the yield is annualized the yield generated by an investment division during the day period is assumed to be generated each day period this yield is computed by dividing the net investment income per accumulation unit earned during the period by the price per unit on the last day of the period according to the following formula yield    a  b       cd where a  net investment income earned during the period by the portfolio or substitute funding vehicle attributable to shares owned by the investment division b  expenses accrued for the period net of reimbursements c  the average daily number of units outstanding during the period d  the maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the period net investment income will be determined in accordance with rules established by the securities and exchange commission accrued expenses will include all recurring fees that are charged to all owner accounts the yield calculations do not reflect the effect of any surrender charges that may be applicable to a particular contract surrender charges range from  to  of the amount of premium withdrawn depending on the elapsed time since the premium was paid because of the charges and deductions imposed by the separate account the yield of the investment division will be lower than the yield for the corresponding portfolio the yield on amounts held in the investment divisions normally will fluctuate over time therefore the disclosed yield for any given past period is not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of return the investment divisions actual yield will be affected by the types and quality of portfolio securities held by the portfolio and its operating expenses standard total return calculations midland national may from time to time also disclose average annual total returns for one or more of the investment divisions for various periods of time average annual total return quotations are computed by finding the average annual compounded rates of return over one five and ten year periods that would equate the initial amount invested to the ending redeemable value according to the following formula p   tn  erv where p  a hypothetical initial payment of  t  average annual total return n  number of years erv  ending redeemable value of a hypothetical  payment made at the beginning of the one five or tenyear period at the end of the one five or tenyear period or fractional portion thereof all recurring fees that are charged to all owner accounts are recognized in the ending redeemable value this includes a contract charges factor that is calculated by taking the daily separate account asset charge and adding an additional amount that adjusts for the annual  annual maintenance fee this additional amount is based on an anticipated average accumulation value of  so it is calculated as  annually the standard average annual total return calculations assume the contract is surrendered and therefore will reflect the effect of surrender charges that may be applicable to a particular period midland national may disclose average annual total returns in various ways depicting a whether the contract is surrendered or maintained in force b whether the optional extra credit rider is selected c whether other optional riders are selected accordingly midland may disclose the following types of average annual total return  the contract is surrendered and has the highest possible combination of riders  the contract is surrendered but no optional riders are selected  the contract is surrendered the extra credit rider is selected but no other optional riders are selected  the contract is not surrendered the extra credit rider is not selected but other optional riders are selected up to the maximum rider mortality and expense risk charge of  and  the contract is not surrendered and neither the extra credit rider nor any other optional riders are selected midland national may from time to time also disclose average annual total returns in a format which assumes that the contract is kept in force through the time period shown such nonstandard returns will be identical to the standard format which assumes the contract is surrendered except that the contingent deferred sales charge percentage will be assumed to be  the nonstandard returns which assume the contract is kept inforce will only be shown in conjunction with standard returns which assume the contract is surrendered cumulative total returns midland national may from time to time also disclose cumulative total returns in conjunction with the annual returns described above the cumulative returns will be calculated using the following formula ctr  ervp   where ctr  the cumulative total return net of investment division recurring charges for the period erv  ending redeemable value of an assumed  payment at the beginning of the one five or tenyear period at the end of the one five or tenyear period or fractional portion thereof p  an assumed initial payment of  the returns which assume the contract is kept inforce will only be shown in conjunction with returns which assume the contract is surrendered midland may also disclose the value of an assumed payment of  or other amounts at the end of various periods of time adjusted historical performance data midland national may also disclose adjusted historical performance data for an investment division for periods before the investment division commenced operations based on the assumption that the investment division was in existence before it actually was and that the investment division had been invested in a particular portfolio that was in existence prior to the investment divisions commencement of operations the portfolio used for these calculations will be the actual portfolio that the investment division will invest in adjusted historical performance data of this type will be calculated as follows first the value of an assumed  investment in the applicable portfolio is calculated on a monthly basis by comparing the net asset value per share at the beginning of the month with the net asset value per share at the end of the month adjusted for any dividend distributions during the month and the resulting ratio is applied to the value of the investment at the beginning of the month to get the gross value of the investment at the end of the month second that gross value is then reduced by a contract charges factor to reflect the charges imposed under the contract the contract charges factor is calculated by taking the daily separate account asset charge and adding an additional amount that adjusts for the annual  annual maintenance fee this additional amount is based on an anticipated average accumulation value of  so it is calculated as  or  annually the total is then divided by  to get the monthly contract charges factor which is then applied to the value of the hypothetical initial payment in the applicable portfolio to get the value in the investment division the contract charges factor is assumed to be deducted at the beginning of each month in this manner the ending redeemable value erv of a hypothetical  initial payment in the investment division is calculated each month during the applicable period to get the erv at the end of the period third that erv is then utilized in the formulas above this type of performance data may be disclosed on both an average annual total return and a cumulative total return basis moreover it may be disclosed assuming that the contract is not surrendered ie with no deduction for the contingent deferred sales charge and assuming that the contract is surrendered at the end of the applicable period ie reflecting a deduction for any applicable contingent deferred sales charge federal tax matters taxfree exchanges section  midland national accepts premiums which are the proceeds of a contract in a transaction qualifying for a taxfree exchange under section  of the internal revenue code we also accept rollovers from contracts qualifying as individual retirement annuities or accounts iras or any other qualified contract which is eligible to rollover into an ira except b contracts the company differentiates between nonqualified contracts and iras to the extent necessary to comply with federal tax laws in all events a tax advisor should be consulted with and relied upon before you effect an exchange or a rollover required distributions in order to be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes section s of the code requires any nonqualified contract to provide that a if any owner dies on or after the annuity date but prior to the time the entire interest in the contract has been distributed the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of that owners death and b if any owner dies prior to the annuity starting date the entire interest in the contract will be distributed  within five years after the date of that owners death or  as annuity payments which will begin within one year of that owners death and which will be made over the life of the owners designated beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of that beneficiary the owners designated beneficiary is the person to whom ownership of the contract passes by reason of death and must be a natural person however if the owners designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the owner the contract may be continued with the surviving spouse as the new owner the nonqualified contracts contain provisions which are intended to comply with the requirements of section s of the code although no regulations interpreting these requirements have yet been issued we intend to review such provisions and modify them if necessary to assure that they comply with the requirements of code section s when clarified by regulation or otherwise other rules may apply to qualified contracts nonnatural person owners if a nonnatural person eg a corporation or a trust owns a nonqualified contract the taxpayer generally must include in income any increase in the excess of the account value over the investment in the contract generally the premiums or other consideration paid for the contract during the taxable year there are some exceptions to this rule and a prospective owner that is not a natural person should discuss these with a tax adviser the tax discussion in the prospectus and herein generally applies to contracts owned by natural persons diversification requirements the code requires that the investments of each investment division of the separate account underlying the contracts be adequately diversified in order for the contracts to be treated as annuity contracts for federal income tax purposes it is intended that each investment division through the fund in which it invests will satisfy these diversification requirements owner control in some circumstances owners of variable contracts who retain control over the investment of the underlying separate account assets may be treated as owners of those assets and may be subject to tax on income produced by those assets although published guidance in this area does not address certain aspects of the contracts we believe that the owner of a contract should not be treated as the owner of the separate account assets we reserve the right to modify the contracts to bring them into conformity with applicable standards should such modification be necessary to prevent owners of the contracts from being treated as the owners of the underlying separate account assets taxation of qualified contracts the tax rules applicable to qualified contracts vary according to the type of retirement plan and the terms and conditions of the plan your rights under a qualified contract may be subject to the terms of the retirement plan itself regardless of the terms of the qualified contract adverse tax consequences may result if you do not ensure

permit individuals to make annual contributions of up to the lesser of a specific dollar amount or the amount of compensation includible in the individuals gross income for the year the contributions may be deductible in whole or in part depending on the individuals income distributions from certain retirement plans may be rolled over into an ira on a taxdeferred basis without regard to these limits amounts in the ira other than nondeductible contributions are taxed when distributed from the ira a  penalty tax generally applies to distributions made before age   unless certain exceptions apply roth iras as described in code section a permit certain eligible individuals to contribute to make nondeductible contributions to a roth ira in cash or as a rollover or transfer from another roth ira or other ira a rollover from or conversion of an ira to a roth ira is generally subject to tax and other special rules apply the owner may wish to consult a tax adviser before combining any converted amounts with any other roth ira contributions including any other conversion amounts from other tax years distributions from a roth ira generally are not taxed except that once aggregate distributions exceed contributions to the roth ira income tax and a  penalty tax may apply to distributions made  before age   subject to certain exceptions or  during the five taxable years starting with the year in which the first contribution is made to any roth ira a  penalty tax may apply to amounts attributable to a conversion from an ira if they are distributed during the five taxable years beginning with the year in which the conversion was made corporate pension and profitsharing plans under section a of the code allow corporate employers to establish various types of retirement plans for employees and selfemployed individuals to establish qualified plans for themselves and their employees adverse tax consequences to the retirement plan the participant or both may result if the contract is transferred to any individual as a means to provide benefit payments unless the plan complies with all the requirements applicable to such benefits prior to transferring the contract tax

beginning after december    earnings on those contributions and  earnings on amounts held as of the last year beginning before january   are not allowed prior to age   severance from employment death

request that the commission pursuant to section c of the act grant the exemptions set forth below to permit the applicants to recapture the bonus credit applied to premium payments when the owner exercises his or her free look right  section c authorizes the commission by order upon application to conditionally or unconditionally grant an exemption from any provision rule or regulation of the act to the extent that the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the contract and provisions of the act because the provisions described below may be inconsistent with a recapture of a bonus credit applicants request exemptions for the contracts described herein and for future contracts from sections a c and ia of the act and rule c thereunder pursuant to section c to the extent necessary to recapture the bonus credit applied to a premium payment in the instance described above applicants do not agree or concede that the proposed recapture would violate any provision of the act or rules thereunder applicants seek exemptions therefrom in order to avoid any questions concerning the contracts compliance with the act and rules thereunder  for the reasons discussed below applicants assert that the recapture of the bonus credit in the circumstances start printed page described herein is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  section i provides that section  does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts nor to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account except as provided for in section ia section ia of the act in pertinent part makes it unlawful for any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or for the sponsoring insurance company of such account to sell any such contract unless such contract is a redeemable security  section a of the act defines “redeemable security” as any security under the terms of which the holder upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent thereof  to the extent that the bonus credit recapture might be seen as a discount from the net asset value or might be viewed as resulting in the payment to an owner of less than the proportionate share of the issuers net assets the bonus credit recapture would trigger the need for relief absent some exemption from the act rule c provides in relevant part that a registered separate account and any depositor of such account shall be exempt from sections a c c c and d of the act and rule c thereunder to the extent necessary to permit them to impose a deferred sales load on any variable annuity contract participating in such account however the bonus credit recapture is not a sales load but a recapture of a bonus credit midland previously applied to an owners premium payments midland provides the bonus credits from its general account on a guaranteed basis the contracts are designed to be longterm investment vehicles in undertaking this financial obligation midland contemplates that an owner will retain a contract over an extended period consistent with the longterm nature of the contracts midland designed its product so that it would recover its costs including the bonus credit over an anticipated duration while a contract is in force if an owner withdraws his or her money from the contract before this anticipated period midland must recapture the bonus credit in order to avoid a loss  applicants submit that the recapture of a bonus credit does not violate section a of the act the applicants submit that the bonus recapture provision in the contracts does not deprive the owner of his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets an owners right to the bonus credit will vest after the freelook period has expired until that time midland retains the right and interest in the dollar amount of any unvested bonus credit amount thus when midland recaptures a bonus credit it is only retrieving its own assets and because an owners interest in the bonus credit is not vested such owner would not be deprived of a proportionate share of the midland accounts assets the issuers current net assets in violation of section a therefore such recapture does not reduce the amount of the midland accounts current net assets an owner would otherwise be entitled to receive however to avoid uncertainty as to full compliance with the act the applicants request an exemption from the provisions of sections a and ia to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the bonus credit under the contracts and future contracts  section c of the act states that the commission may make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of and dealers in the redeemable securities of any registered investment company to accomplish the same ends as contemplated by section a rule c promulgated under section c of the act in pertinent part prohibits a registered investment company issuing a redeemable security and a person designated in such issuers prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in such security and a principal underwriter of or dealer in any such security from selling redeeming or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security  as a result of a  bonus credit an owner who made a  initial premium payment could be viewed as having an accumulation value of  before any earnings accrued midlands addition of the bonus credit might arguably be viewed as resulting in an owner purchasing a redeemable security for a price below the current net asset value further by recapturing the bonus credit midland might arguably be redeeming a redeemable security for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the midland account the applicants contend that these are not correct interpretations or applications of these statutory and regulatory provisions the applicants contend that the bonus credit does not violate section c and rule c  an owners interest in his or her accumulation value or in the midland account would always be offered at a price based on the net asset value next calculated after receipt of the order the granting of a bonus credit does not reflect a reduction of that price instead midland will purchase with its own general account assets an interest in the midland account equal to the bonus credit because the bonus credit will be paid out of midlands assets not the midland accounts assets no dilution will occur as a result of the credit  the recapture of the bonus credit does not involve either of the evils that the commission intended to eliminate or reduce with rule c the commissions stated purposes in adopting rule c were to avoid or minimize a dilution of the interests of other security holders and b speculative trading practices that are unfair to such holders these evils were the result of backward pricing the practice of basing the price of a mutual fund share on the net asset value per share determined as of the close of the market on the previous day backward pricing allowed investors to take advantage of increases or decreases in net asset value that were not yet reflected in the price and thereby the values of outstanding mutual fund shares were diluted  the proposed recapture of the bonus credit does not pose such threat of dilution the bonus credit recapture will not alter an owners net asset value midland will determine an owners surrender value under a contract in accordance with rule c on a basis next computed after receipt of an owners request for surrender likewise the calculation of death benefits and annuity payment amounts will be in full compliance with the forward pricing requirement of rule c the amount recaptured will equal the amount of the bonus credit that midland paid out of its general account assets the applicants represent that it is not administratively feasible to track the bonus credit in the midland account after midland applies the credit as a result the assetbased charges applicable to the midland account will be assessed against the entire amount held in the midland account including the bonus credit amount during the time the bonus credit has not vested during the “free look” period applicants state that during the free look period the aggregate assetbased charges assessed start printed page against an owners accumulation value will be higher than those that would be charged if the owners accumulation value did not include the bonus credit but the increment will obviously be only a small percentage of the credit amount on the other hand an owner will retain the investment benefit from the bonus credit although an owner will retain any investment gain attributable to the bonus credit midland will determine the amount of such gain on the basis of the current net asset value of the investment division thus no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the bonus credit  further applicants submit that the other harm that rule c was designed to address speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing will not occur as a result of midlands recapture of the bonus credit variable annuities are designed for longterm investment and by their nature do not lend themselves to the kind of speculative shortterm trading that rule c was designed to prevent more to the point the credit recapture simply does not create the opportunity for speculative trading  rule c and section c should have no application to the bonus credit as neither of the harms that rule c was designed to address are present in the recapture of the bonus credit however to avoid uncertainty as to full compliance with the act the applicants request an exemption from the provisions of section c and rule c to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the bonus credit under the contracts and future contracts  the applicants submit that the commission should grant the exemptions requested in this application even if the bonus credit described herein arguably conflicts with sections a c or ia of the act or rule c thereunder the bonus credit provisions are generally very favorable and very beneficial to owners the recapture provisions temper this benefit somewhat but only if an owner withdraws his or her money under the circumstance described herein while there would be a small downside in a declining market where an owner would bear any losses attributable to the bonus credit it is the converse of the benefits an owner would receive on the bonus credit in a rising market as any earnings on a bonus credit applied would vest immediately with an owner likewise any losses on the bonus credit would also vest immediately with an owner the bonus credit recapture provision does not diminish the overall value of the bonus credit  midlands recapture of the bonus credit is designed to prevent antiselection against it the risk of antiselection would be that an owner could make significant premium payments into the contract solely in order to receive a quick profit from the credit by recapturing a bonus credit midland protects itself against the risk that an owner will make such large premium payments receive a bonus credit and then withdraw his or her money from the contract under the free look provision midland generally protects itself from this kind of antiselection and recovers its costs in situations where an owner withdraws his or her money early in the life of a contract by imposing a surrender charge of up to  however where an owner withdraws his money pursuant to a “freelook” provision midland does not apply this charge midland is only seeking to recapture the bonus credit in this circumstance where it does not apply the surrender charge  midland contends that it would be inherently unfair to allow an owner exercising the freelook privilege in a contract to retain the bonus credit when returning the contract for a refund after a period of only a few days usually  or less if midland could not recapture the bonus credit individuals might purchase a contract with no intention of retaining it and simply return it for a quick profit by recapturing the bonus credit midland can and must prevent such individuals from doing so conclusion  for the reasons discussed above the applicants submit that the bonus credit involves none of the abuses to which provisions of the act and the rules thereunder are directed the owner will always retain the investment experience attributable to the bonus credit and will retain the principal amount in all cases except under the single circumstance described herein further midland should be able to recapture such bonus credit to protect itself from investors wishing to use the contract as a vehicle for a quick profit at midlands expense and to enable midland to limit potential losses associated with such bonus credit  accordingly applicants request exemptions from sections a c and ia of the act and rule c thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the applicants to recapture the bonus credit applied to a premium payment in the circumstance described above for the reasons set forth above applicants believe that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act and consistent with and supported by commission precedent  applicants seek relief herein not only for themselves with respect to the support of the contracts but also with respect to future accounts or future contracts described herein applicants represent that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any contracts or future contracts funded by the midland account or future accounts are consistent with the standards set forth in section c of the act and commission precedent the commission has previously granted class relief from certain specified provisions of the act for separate accounts that support variable annuity contracts that is materially similar to the relief described in this application  in addition applicants seek relief herein with respect to future underwriters ie a class consisting of nasd member brokerdealers which may also act as principal underwriter of the contracts and future contracts the commission has regularly granted relief to “future underwriters” that are not named and are not affiliates of the applicants applicants represent that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any future underwriters are consistent with the standards set forth in section c of the act and commission precedent  applicants state that without the requested class relief exemptive relief for any future account future contract or future underwriter would have to be requested and obtained separately applicants assert that these additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the act not already addressed herein applicants state that if the applicants were to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed herein investors would not receive additional protection or benefit and investors and the applicants could be disadvantaged by increased costs from preparing such additional requests for relief applicants argue that the requested class relief is appropriate in the public interest because the relief will promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need for midland to file redundant exemptive applications thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources elimination of the delay and the expense of repeatedly seeking exemptive relief would applicants start printed page opine enhance applicants ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as such opportunities arise applicants submit for all the reasons stated herein that their request for class exemptions is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act and that an order of the commission including such class relief should therefore be granted any entity that currently intends to rely on the requested exemptive order is named as an applicant any entity that relies upon the requested order in the future will comply with the terms and conditions contained in this application  applicants represent that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act start signature for the commission by the division of investment

unit values that are priced below the true value or transfers out of the investment division are made at unit values priced higher than the true value some market timers attempt to do this through methods known as timezone arbitrage and liquidity arbitrage  an adverse effect on portfolio management such as causing the portfolio to maintain a higher level of cash than would otherwise be the case or causing a portfolio to liquidate investments prematurely or otherwise at an inopportune time in order to pay withdrawals and  increased brokerage and administrative expenses in addition because other insurance companies andor retirement plans may invest in the portfolios the risk exists that that the portfolios may suffer harm from frequent programmed large or shortterm transfers among

accumulation units are sold or redeemed when you make a full or partial surrender or transfer amounts from an investment division and to pay the death benefit when the annuitant or owner dies we also redeem units to pay for certain charges we calculate the number of accumulation units purchased or redeemed in an investment division by dividing the dollar amount of the transaction by the investment divisions accumulation unit value at the end of that day if it is a business day if it is not a business day we will use the unit value on the next business day the number of accumulation units

changes will effect transactions as of the date we receive your request at our principal office changing your allocation instructions will not change the way your existing accumulation value is apportioned among the investment divisions or the fixed account while the dollar cost averaging dca program is in effect the allocation percentages that apply to any premiums received will be the dca allocation percentages unless you specify otherwise see dollar cost averaging on page  your accumulation value your accumulation value is the sum of your amounts in the fixed account and the various investment divisions your accumulation value reflects the investment performance of the portfolios in the investment divisions any premium payments made any surrenders any transfers loans withdrawals and any charges assessed in connection with the contract there is no guaranteed minimum accumulation value transaction and surrender charges are made on the effective date of the transaction charges against our separate account are reflected daily we guarantee amounts allocated to the fixed account your accumulation value in the fixed account will be reduced by the contract fees and charges we deduct and the effects of any contract transactions loans surrenders and transfers on your accumulation value in the fixed account there is no guaranteed minimum accumulation value for amounts allocated to the investment divisions of our separate account you bear the investment risk an investment divisions performance will cause your accumulation value to go up or down transfers of accumulation value you generally may transfer amounts among the investment divisions and between the fixed account and any investment division prior to maturity date the amount that you can transfer into or out of the fixed account is limited transfers out of the myg options of the fixed account are subject to an interest adjustment see fixed account on page  and multiyear guarantee myg options on page  for details currently you may make an unlimited number of transfers of accumulation value in each contract year prior to the maturity date subject to the transfer limitations below however we reserve the right to assess a  charge for each transfer after the th transfer in a contract year the minimum transfer amount is  or  of an investment division if less than  the minimum amount does not have to come from or be transferred to just one investment division the only requirement is that the total amount transferred that day equals the transfer minimum completed transfer requests received at our principal office before the new york stock exchange closes for regular trading usually  pm central time are priced at the unit value determined at the close of that regular trading session of the new york stock exchange if we receive your completed transfer after the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange we will process the transfer request at the unit value determined at the close of the next regular trading session of the new york stock exchange for information regarding telephone or facsimile requests see inquiries on page  for limitations on transfers to and from the fixed account see fixed account on page  after the maturity date you can make only two transfers per contract year and only among the investment divisions of the separate account we reserve the right to eliminate andor severely restrict the transfer privilege in any manner we deem appropriate for some all or specific contract owners transfer limitations frequent large programmed or shortterm transfers among investment divisions such as those associated with market timing transactions can adversely affect the portfolios and the returns achieved by contract owners in particular such transfers may dilute the value of the portfolios shares interfere with the efficient management of the portfolios investments and increase brokerage and administrative costs of the portfolios in order to try to protect our contract owners and the portfolios from potentially harmful trading activity we have implemented certain market timing policies and procedures the market timing procedures our market timing procedures are designed to detect and prevent frequent or shortterm transfer activity among the investment divisions of the separate account that may adversely affect other contract owners or portfolio shareholders more specifically currently our market timing procedures are intended to detect potentially harmful trading or transfer activity by monitoring for any two interfund transfer requests on a contract within a five business day period in which the requests are moving to and from identical subaccounts for example a transfer from american century vp international portfolio to fidelity money market portfolio followed by a transfer from fidelity money market portfolio back to american century vp international portfolio within five business days we will review transfer requests daily blotters and transaction logs in an attempt to identify transfers that exceed these transfer parameters when we identify a second trade within five days of the first we will review those transfers and other transfers in the same contract to determine if in our judgment the transfers are part of a market timing strategy or otherwise have the potential to be harmful we will honor and process the second transfer request but if we believe that the activity is potentially harmful we will suspend that contracts transfer privileges and we will not accept another transfer request for  business days we will attempt to inform the contract owner or registered representative by telephone that their transfers have been deemed potentially harmful to others and that their transfer privilege is suspended for  days if we do not succeed in reaching the contract owner or registered representative by phone we will send a letter by first class mail to the contract owners address of record in addition to our own market timing procedures managers of the investment portfolios might contact us if they believe or suspect that there is market timing or other potentially harmful trading and if so we will take appropriate action to protect others in particular we may and we reserve the right to reverse a potentially harmful transfer if so we will inform the contract owner andor registered representative in our sole discretion we may revise our market timing procedures at any time without prior notice as we deem necessary or appropriate to better detect and deter frequent programmed large or shortterm transfers that may adversely affect other contract owners or portfolio shareholders to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements or to impose additional or alternate restrictions on market timers such as dollar or percentage limits on transfers we may change our parameters to monitor for a different number of transfers with different time periods and we may include other factors such as the size of transfers made by contract owners within given periods of time as well as the number of round trip transfers into and out of particular investment divisions for purposes of applying the parameters used to detect potential market timing and other potentially harmful activity we may aggregate transfers made in two or more contracts that we believe are connected for example two contracts with the same owner or owned by spouses or owned by different partnerships or corporations that are under common control etc we do not include transfers made pursuant to the dollar cost averaging programs and portfolio rebalancing program in these limitations we may vary our market timing procedures from investment division to investment division and may be more restrictive with regard to certain investment divisions than others we may not always apply these detections methods to investment divisions investing in portfolios that in our judgment would not be particularly attractive to market timers or otherwise susceptible to harm by frequent transfers we reserve the right to place restrictions on the methods of implementing transfers for some or all contract owners that we believe might otherwise engage in trading activity that is harmful to others for example we might only accept transfers by original wet contract owner signature conveyed through the us mail that is we can refuse transfer requests submitted by phone facsimile email or by any other electronic means we also reserve the right to implement and administer redemption fees imposed by one or more of the portfolios in the future contract owners seeking to engage in frequent programmed large or shortterm transfer activity may deploy a variety of strategies to avoid detection our ability to detect and deter such transfer activity is limited by operational systems and technological limitations in addition the terms of the contract may also limit our ability to restrict or deter harmful transfers furthermore the identification of contract owners determined to be engaged in transfer activity that may adversely affect other contract owners or portfolios shareholders involves judgments that are inherently subjective accordingly despite our best efforts we cannot guarantee that our market timing procedures will detect every potential market timer but we apply our market timing procedures consistently to all contract owners without special arrangement waiver or exception we may vary our market timing procedures among our other variable insurance products to account for differences in various factors such as operational systems and contract provisions in addition because other insurance companies andor retirement plans may invest in the portfolios we cannot guarantee that the portfolios will not suffer harm from frequent programmed large or shortterm transfers among investment divisions of variable contracts issued by other insurance companies or among investment options available to retirement plan participants to the extent permitted by applicable law we reserve the right to defer the transfer privilege at any time that we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of any of the portfolios available through separate account c including any refusal or restriction on purchases or redemptions of their shares as a result of their own policies and procedures on market timing activities or other potentially abusive transfers you should read the prospectuses of the portfolios for more details on their ability to refuse or restrict purchases or redemptions of their shares surrenders you may withdraw all or part of your surrender value by sending us a written request at our principal office the surrender value is the separate account accumulation value plus fixed account accumulation value adjusted for an interest adjustment if applicable minus any applicable surrender charges and annual maintenance fee in some states a premium tax charge may also be deducted surrenders may be restricted by a retirement plan under which you are covered partial surrenders from an investment division or the fixed account must be made in amounts of  or more except for systematic withdrawals described below and cannot reduce your accumulation value to less than  if a partial surrender results in less than  remaining then the entire accumulation value must be withdrawn for a full surrender you must send in your contract with your surrender request any applicable surrender charge and any required tax withholding will be deducted from the amount paid any portion of the fixed account accumulation value allocated to the myg options may be subject to an interest adjustment in addition upon full surrender an annual maintenance fee and possibly a premium tax charge may be subtracted completed surrender requests received at our principal office before the new york stock exchange closes for regular trading usually  pm central time are priced at the unit value determined at the close of that regular trading session of the new york stock exchange if we receive your completed surrender request after the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange we will process the surrender request at the unit value determined at the close of the next regular trading session of the new york stock exchange we will generally pay the surrender amount from the separate account within seven days after we receive a properly completed surrender request in good order we may defer payment for a longer period only when o trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted as defined by the sec o the new york stock exchange is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closing o an emergency exists as defined by the sec as a result of which disposal of the separate accounts securities or determination of the net asset value of each investment division is not reasonably practicable or o for such other periods as the sec may by order permit for the protection of owners see when we pay proceeds from this contract on page  if we defer payment for  or more days then during the period of deferment we will pay interest at the rate required by the jurisdiction in which this contract is delivered we expect to pay the surrender amount from the fixed account promptly but we have the right to delay payment for up to six months unless you specify otherwise your partial surrender will be allocated among all investment divisions and the fixed account excluding the fixed account dca and myg options in the same proportion as your accumulation value bears to each investment division and the fixed account this allocation is subject to minimum amount requirements the surrender charge will be determined without reference to the source of the partial surrender the charge will be based on the length of time between premium payments and surrenders see charges fees and deductions on page  a surrender will generally have federal income tax consequences that can include income tax penalties and tax withholding you should consult your tax advisor before making a surrender see federal tax status on page  surrenders may be restored under certain types of qualified contracts if allowed the restoration will be effective as of the date that surrender proceeds are returned to midland national under certain types of retirement arrangements the retirement equity act of  provides that in the case of a married participant a surrender request must include the consent of the participants spouse this consent must contain the participants signature and the notarized or properly witnessed signature of the participants spouse these spousal consent requirements generally apply to married participants in most qualified pension plans including plans for selfemployed individuals that are considered employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of  erisa you should check the terms of your retirement plan and consult with a tax advisor before making a surrender see federal tax status on page  loans loans are only available if you purchase this contract in connection with a qualified plan under section b of the internal revenue code after the first contract anniversary and prior to the maturity date owners of contracts issued in connection with section b qualified plans may request a loan using the contract as security for the loan only one loan may be outstanding at any time loans are subject to provisions of the internal revenue code and the terms of the retirement program you should consult a tax advisor before requesting a loan only one loan can be made within a month period the loan amount must be at least  such loan when added to the outstanding balance of loans from this contract or other contracts maintained by the employee will be limited to the lesser of the following a  reduced by the excess if any of i the highest outstanding balance of loans from this contract or other contracts maintained by the employee during the one year period ending on the day before the date on which the loan is made over ii the outstanding balance of loans from this contract or other contracts maintained by the employee on the date which such loan is made or b the greater of i one half of the present value of the nonforfeitable cash surrender value of this contract or ii  the portion of the accumulation value that is equal to the loan amount will be held in the fixed account and will earn interest at the fixed account minimum interest rate of  per year you should tell us how much of the loan you want taken from your unloaned amount in the fixed account or from the separate account investment divisions if you do not tell us how to allocate your loan the loan will be allocated among all investment divisions and the fixed account excluding the fixed account dca and myg options in the same proportion as the value of your interest in each division bears to your total accumulation value we will redeem units from each investment division equal in value to the amount of the loan allocated to that investment division and transfer that amount to the fixed account a loan taken from values allocated to the multiguarantee options will be subject to an interest adjustment we charge interest on loans at the rate of  per year in arrears loan interest is due at the end of each quarter unpaid interest will be added to the loan and accrue interest if the total loan plus loan interest equals or exceeds the accumulation value minus any applicable surrender charges then the contract will terminate with no further value in such case we will give you at least  days written notice termination under these circumstances may adversely affect the treatment of the contract under the internal revenue code section b the total loan plus loan interest will be deducted from any amount applied under a payment option or otherwise payable under the contract the loan agreement will describe the amount duration and restrictions on the loan in general loans must be repaid in monthly or quarterly installments within  years if a quarterly installment is not received by the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the payment was due then a deemed distribution of the entire amount of the outstanding loan principal interest due and any applicable charges under the contract including any withdrawal charge will be made this deemed distribution may be subject to income and penalty tax under the internal revenue code and may adversely affect the treatment of the contract under the internal revenue code section b a loan has a permanent effect on the accumulation value because the investment experience of the investment divisions will apply only to the unborrowed portion of the accumulation value the longer the loan is outstanding the greater the effect is likely to be the effect could be favorable or unfavorable if the net investment results are greater than  per year while the loan is outstanding then the accumulation value will not increase as rapidly as it would have if no debt were outstanding if net investment results are below  per year then the accumulation value will be higher than it would have been had no loan been outstanding in addition a loan costs you a net interest charge of  per year dollar cost averaging the dollar cost averaging dca program enables you to make monthly or quarterly transfers of a predetermined dollar amount from the dca source account any investment division or the fixed account into one or more of the investment divisions you cannot transfer from a dca account into the myg options this dollar cost averaging program has more flexibility then the fixed account dca described above but generally pays a lower rate of interest this program may reduce the impact of market fluctuations by allocating monthly or quarterly as opposed to allocating the total amount at one time this plan of investing does not insure a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets the minimum monthly or quarterly amount to be transferred using dca is  you can elect the dca program at any time only one active dca account is allowed at a time you must complete the proper request forms and send them to our principal office and there must be a sufficient amount in the dca source account you can get a sufficient amount by paying a premium with the dca request form allocating premiums or transferring amounts to the dca source account copies of the dca request form can be obtained by contacting us at our principal office the election will specify o the dca source account from which transfers will be made o that any money received with the form is to be placed into the dca source account o the total monthly or quarterly amount to be transferred to the other investment divisions and o how that monthly or quarterly amount is to be allocated among the investment divisions o the dca request form must be received with any premium payment you intend to apply to dca once you elect dca additional premiums can be deposited into the dca source account by sending them in with a dca request form all amounts in the dca source account will be available for transfer under the dca program any premium payments received while the dca program is in effect will be allocated using the allocation percentages from the dca request form unless you specify otherwise you may change the dca allocation percentages or dca transfer amounts twice during a contract year if it is requested when the contract is issued then dca will start at the beginning of the second contract month if it is requested after issue then dca will start at the beginning of the next contract month after the request is received if a dca program is elected after issue and the source account is the fixed account the minimum number of months for the program is  months we will process dca transfers for a maximum of  months you may continue to participate in the dca program beyond the  month period by providing us with written authorization at the end of each  month time period dca automatically terminates on the maturity date you may stop the dca program at any time by sending us written notice we reserve the right to end the dca program by sending you one months written notice we do not charge any specific fees for you to participate in a dca program while we currently do not charge for transfers we do reserve the right to charge  for each transfer after the th in any contract year however initiating a dca program will only count once in determining the  charge for each transfer after the th in a contract year portfolio rebalancing the portfolio rebalancing option allows contract owners who are not dollar cost averaging to reset the percentage of accumulation value allocated to each investment division to a preset percentage level on a monthly quarterly semiannual or annual basis if you elect this option then on the contract anniversary date each month or quarter we will transfer the amounts needed to rebalance the accumulation value to your most recent specified percentages all rebalancing transfers will include allocations to the fixed account but will not include allocations to the myg options rebalancing may result in transferring amounts from an investment division earning a relatively high return to one earning a relatively low return portfolio rebalancing will remain in effect until we receive your written termination request we reserve the right to end the portfolio rebalancing option by sending you one months notice contact us at our principal office to elect the portfolio rebalancing option there is no charge for portfolio rebalancing and a portfolio rebalancing transfer is not considered a transfer for purposes of possibly assessing a transfer charge fixed account earnings sweep program you may elect to have any fixed account interest earnings transferred on a monthly or quarterly basis to one or more of the separate account investment divisions interest earned on funds allocated to the myg options in the fixed account cannot be included in the fixed account earnings sweep program transfers will be made on the contract anniversary day each month or quarter to the investment divisions you select or according to the dca program while this program is active you may not allocate future premium payments to the fixed account amounts transferred out of the fixed account due to an earnings sweep transfer are counted toward the  of fixed account accumulation value that may be transferred out of the fixed account during any contract year the fixed account earnings sweep program may not be available in all states your state of issue will determine if the fixed account earnings sweep program is available on your contract there is no charge for fixed account earnings sweeps program and a fixed account earnings sweep transfer is not considered a transfer for purposes of possibly assessing a transfer charge systematic withdrawals the systematic withdrawal feature allows you to have a portion of the accumulation value withdrawn automatically these payments can be made only  while the annuitant is living  before the maturity date and  after the free look period this feature cannot be used for amounts allocated to the myg options or the dca options in the fixed account you may elect this option by sending a properly completed preauthorized systematic withdrawal request form to our principal office you may designate the systematic withdrawal amount or the period for systematic withdrawal payments you will also designate the desired frequency of the systematic withdrawals which may be monthly quarterly semiannually or annually see your contract for details on systematic withdrawal options and when each begins if the new york stock exchange is closed for regular trading on the day when the withdrawal is to be made then we will process your withdrawal at the unit value determined at the close of the next regular trading session of the new york stock exchange the deduction caused by the systematic withdrawal will be allocated proportionately to your accumulation value in the investment divisions and the fixed account you can stop or modify the systematic withdrawals by sending us a written request a proper written request must include the consent of any effective assignee or irrevocable beneficiary if applicable each systematic withdrawal must be at least  we reserve the right to change the frequency of payments or discontinue payments if the payment is less than  upon payment we reduce your accumulation value by an amount equal to the payment proceeds plus any applicable surrender charge see surrender charges on surrenders on page  the surrender charge applies to systematic withdrawals in excess of the free surrender amount in the same manner as it applies to other partial surrenders with the exception that a portion of the free surrender amount can be received more than once per year as long as the full  of your gross premiums has not been withdrawn under midland nationals current company practice systematic withdrawals taken to satisfy irs required minimum distribution rules and paid under a life expectancy option will not be subject to a surrender charge we reserve the right to change this practice in the future any systematic withdrawal that would equal or exceed the surrender value will be treated as a complete surrender in no event will the payment of a systematic withdrawal exceed the surrender value the contract will automatically terminate if a systematic withdrawal causes the contracts surrender value to equal zero to the extent if any that there is gain in the contract systematic withdrawals generally are included in the contract owners gross income for tax purposes in the year in which the withdrawal occurs and may be subject to a penalty tax of  before age   additional terms and conditions for the systematic withdrawal program are set forth in your contract and in the application for the program free surrender amount you may withdraw up to  of your gross premiums sum of all premiums paid determined on the date of the surrender request once each contract year without incurring a surrender charge in each contract year if this option is not exercised or if less than  is withdrawn any unused amount will not be carried over to a subsequent contract year and generally will not be carried over to a subsequent withdrawal in the same contract year however by current company practice we will allow multiple free withdrawals up to  of gross premiums each contract year this is not guaranteed the value of  of the gross premiums is determined on the date of the first partial surrender an interest adjustment may be deducted from any premium withdrawn from the myg options prior to the end of the guarantee period for more information see multiyear guarantee myg options on page  a withdrawal may have federal income tax consequences that can include income tax penalties and tax withholding see federal tax status on page  death benefit if the annuitant or an owner dies before the maturity date and while the contract is still inforce we will pay the death benefit to the beneficiary once we receive at our principal office satisfactory proof of the annuitants or owners death an election of how the death benefit is to be paid and any other documents or forms required you can name different beneficiaries for annuitants and owners death if the annuitant who is not an owner dies prior to the maturity date the death benefit paid to the annuitants beneficiary must be paid within one year of the annuitants death for joint annuitants the death benefit is paid upon the second death if an owner dies prior to the maturity date then the death benefit paid to the owners beneficiary must be paid within  years of the owners death other than amounts payable to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse of the owner for joint owners the death benefit is paid upon the first death the value of the death benefit as described below will be determined based on the accumulation value on the business day that our principal office receives proof of death an election of how the death benefit is to be paid and any other documents or forms required unless a payment option is selected and all other required forms and documentation are received within  days after we receive proof of death the death benefit will be paid as a lump sum calculated as of that date when a death benefit is paid on the death of the annuitant and a payment option is selected within  days after the annuitants death the payment option must be an annuity for the life of the payee or for a period extending no longer than the payees life expectancy and payments must begin within one year of the date of death when a death benefit is paid on the death of an owner or a joint owner and a payment option is selected the payment option must be an annuity for the life of the payee or for a period extending no longer than the payees life expectancy and payments must begin within one year of the date of death if the annuitant or owner dies on or after the maturity date then any remaining amounts other than amounts payable to or for the benefit of the owners surviving spouse must be paid at least as rapidly as the benefits were being paid at the time of the owners death other rules relating to distributions at death apply to qualified contracts if joint owners or joint annuitants die within  hours of one another they are considered to have died simultaneously and the eldest is presumed to have died first in the event of simultaneous death of the owner and the annuitant the owner is presumed to have died first and the owners beneficiary would be paid the death benefit the death benefit paid to the beneficiary will be the greatest of a the accumulation value when we receive due proof of death an election of how the death benefit is to be paid and any other documentation or forms required or b  of the total net premium payments made to your contract if the annuitant or owner dies on or after the maturity date we will pay any remaining guaranteed payments to the beneficiary as provided in the annuity option selected naming different persons as owner and annuitant can affect whether the death benefit is payable the amount of the benefit and who will receive it use care when naming owners annuitants and beneficiaries and consult your registered representative if you have questions premium taxes may be deducted from the death benefit proceeds payment of death benefits in most cases when a death benefit is paid in a lump sum we will pay the death benefit by establishing an interest bearing account called the midland access account for the beneficiary in the amount of the death benefit we will send the beneficiary a checkbook and the beneficiary will have access to the account simply by writing a check for all or any part of the amount of the death benefit the midland access account is part of our fixed account it is not a bank account and it is not insured by the fdic or any other government agency as part of our fixed account it is subject to the claims of our creditors we receive a benefit from all amounts left in the midland access account charges fees and deductions surrender charges on surrenders we may deduct a surrender charge from any full or partial surrender including a surrender to effect an annuity and on systematic withdrawals that exceeds the free surrender amount this charge partially reimburses us for the selling and distributing costs of this contract these include commissions and the costs of preparing sales literature and printing prospectuses if the surrender charge is insufficient to cover all distribution expenses then the deficiency will be met from our surplus that may be in part derived from mortality and expense risks charges described below for the purpose of determining the surrender charge any amount that you withdraw will be treated as being from premiums first and then from investment income if any and without regard to allocations of premiums or surrenders among investment divisions premium payments are considered withdrawn in the order that they were received there is no surrender charge on the investment income if any withdrawn the length of time between each premium payment and surrender determines the amount of the surrender charge the charge is a percentage of the premiums withdrawn and equals length of time from premium payment surrender number of years charge             at the time of withdrawal if your accumulation value is less than your net premium the surrender charge will still be assessed against the full remaining net premium amount under midland nationals current company practice amounts withdrawn under the contract to comply with irs minimum distribution rules and paid under a life expectancy option will not be subject to a surrender charge we reserve the right to change this practice in the future amounts withdrawn to comply with irs minimum distribution rules will reduce the amount available under the free surrender amount mortality and expense risk charge we deduct a daily charge for mortality and expense risks at an effective annual rate to  of the accumulation values in the separate account until the maturity date if you have selected an annuity option offering fixed payments or interest if you have selected a variable annuity option we will continue to assess this charge after the maturity date this charge compensates us for assuming certain mortality and expense risks no mortality and expense charge is deducted from the fixed account the investment divisions accumulation unit values and annuity unit values reflect this charge we expect to profit from this charge we may use the profit for any purpose including paying distribution expenses however the level of this charge is guaranteed for the life of the contract and may not be increased the mortality risk we bear arises in part from our obligation to make monthly annuity payments regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual may live these payments are guaranteed in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in your contract this assures you that neither the longevity of the annuitant nor an unanticipated improvement in general life expectancy will have any adverse effect on the monthly annuity payments the annuitant will receive under the contract our obligation therefore relieves the annuitant from the risk that he or she will outlive the funds accumulated for retirement the mortality risk also arises in part because of the risk that the death benefit may be greater than the accumulation value we also assume the risk that other expense charges may be insufficient to cover the actual expenses we incur annual maintenance fee we deduct an annual maintenance fee of  on each contract anniversary on or before the maturity date we reserve the right to increase this charge however it will not exceed  per contract year currently we waive the annual maintenance fee for section b sepira and  qualified plans or if your net premium is  or more on the contract anniversary this charge is for our record keeping and other expenses incurred in maintaining the contracts at the end of each contract year we deduct this charge proportionally from each investment division and the fixed account if the contract is surrendered during a contract year and the net premium is less than  then we will deduct the full annual maintenance fee for the current contract year at that time we will not deduct the annual maintenance fee in the event of annuitization or death we may reduce the annual maintenance fee for contracts issued in a manner that results in a savings of administrative expenses the amount of reductions will be considered on a casebycase basis and reflect our expected reductions in administrative expenses interest adjustment we may make an interest adjustment from all amounts withdrawn from any myg account prior the end of the guarantee period transfers loans annuitization and surrender including any free surrender amount we will not make an interest adjustment upon the death of the owner or annuitant the interest adjustment may result in a positive or negative adjustment to amounts surrendered transferred or annuitized from the myg options during the guaranteed period the interest adjustment reflects changes in the interest rates declared by midland national since the contract issue date for each myg option the interest adjustment formula compares the interest rate at issue and the current declared interest rate as of the date the interest adjustment is calculated the interest adjustment can either decrease or increase the amount to be received depending upon whether there has been an increase or decrease in declared interest rates respectively the interest adjustment will be applicable for the entire guarantee period you elect an interest adjustment either positive or negative will be limited to the difference between the myg options accumulation value and the minimum guaranteed fund value transfer charge currently we do not charge you for making transfers of accumulation value among investment divisions we reserve the right to assess a  charge for each transfer after the th transfer in a contract year if we charge you for making a transfer then we will allocate the charge proportionally to the investment divisions and fixed account from which the transfer is being made all transfers included in one transfer request count as only one transfer for purposes of any fee for example if the transfer is made from two investment divisions and a charge applies then a  transfer charge will be deducted from each of the two investment divisions loan charge loan interest is charged in arrears on the outstanding loan loan interest that is unpaid when due will be added to the outstanding loan at the end of each contract quarter or if earlier on the date of loan repayment surrender contract termination or the annuitants death and will bear interest at the same rate of the loan we charge interest on loans at the rate of  per year after offsetting the  annual interest rate we guarantee we will credit to the portion of our fixed account securing the loan the maximum guaranteed net cost of a loan is  per year charges in the funds the funds charge their portfolios for managing investments and providing services the portfolios may also pay operating expenses each portfolios charges and expenses vary see the funds  prospectuses for more information premium taxes midland will deduct from your accumulation value at surrender death or annuitization a charge for any premium taxes levied by a state or any other government entity premium taxes currently levied by certain jurisdictions vary from  to  this range is subject to change the company currently deducts such charges from contracts issued in the states of south dakota wyoming maine and west virginia these states and jurisdictions are subject to change other taxes at the present time we do not make any charges to the separate account for any federal state or local taxes other than premium taxes that we incur which may be attributable to such account or to the contracts we reserve the right to make a charge for any such tax or economic burden resulting from the application of the tax laws federal tax status introduction note we have prepared the following information on federal income taxes as a general discussion of the subject it is not intended as tax advice to any individual you should consult your own tax advisor about your own circumstances we have included an additional discussion regarding taxes in the sai annuity contracts in general deferred annuities are a way of setting aside money for future needs like retirement congress recognized how important saving for retirement is and provided special rules in the internal revenue code for annuities simply stated these rules provide that generally you will not be taxed on the gain if any on the money held in your annuity contract until you take the money out this is referred to as tax deferral there are different rules as to how you will be taxed depending on how you take the money out and the type of contract  qualified or nonqualified discussed below you will generally not be taxed on increases in the value of your contract until a distribution occurs  either as a surrender or as annuity payments when a nonnatural person eg corporation or certain other entities other than taxqualified trusts owns a nonqualified contract the contract will generally not be treated as an annuity for tax purposes there are some exceptions to this rule and a prospective owner that is not a natural person should discuss these with a tax advisor qualified and nonqualified contracts if you invest in a variable annuity as part of an individual retirement plan pension plan or employersponsored retirement program your contract is called a qualified contract if your annuity is independent of any formal retirement or pension plan it is termed a nonqualified contract the tax rules applicable to qualified contracts vary according to the type of retirement plan and the terms and conditions of the plan qualified contracts are issued in connection with the plans listed below there is additional information about qualified contracts in the statement of additional information o individual retirement annuity ira a traditional ira allows individuals to make contributions which may be deductible to the contract o a roth ira also allows individuals to make contributions to the contract but it does not allow a deduction for contributions and distributions may be taxfree if the owner meets certain rules o corporate pension and profitsharing and hr  plan employers and selfemployed individuals can establish pension or profitsharing plans for their employees or themselves and make contributions to the contract on a pretax basis o deferred compensation plan  plan certain governmental and taxexempt organization can establish a plan to defer compensation on behalf of their employees through contributions to the contract o under code section b payments made by public school systems and certain tax exempt organizations to purchase annuity contracts for their employees are excludable from the gross income of the employee subject to certain limitations however these payments may be subject to fica social security taxes a qualified contract issued as a taxsheltered annuity under section b will be amended as necessary to conform to the requirements of the code code section b restricts the distribution under code section b annuity contracts of  elective contributions made in years beginning after december    earning on those contributions and  earnings in such years on amounts held as of the last year beginning before january   distribution of those amounts may only occur upon death of the employee attainment of age   disability severance from employment or hardship in addition income attributable to elective contributions may not be distributed in the case of hardship o under code section a corporate employers and selfemployed individuals can establish various types of retire plans o under code section  governmental and taxexempt organizations can establish deferred compensation plans the contract contains death benefit features that in some cases may exceed the greater of the net premium payments or the accumulation value these death benefit features could be characterized as an incidental benefit the amount of which is limited in any pension profitsharing plan or b plan because the death benefit may exceed this limitation employers using the contract in connection with such plans should consult their tax advisor the internal revenue service has not reviewed the contract for qualification as an ira and has not addressed in a ruling of general applicability whether a death benefit provision such as the provisions in the contract comports with ira qualification requirements qualified contracts have minimum distribution rules that govern the timing and amount of distributions distributions before age   may be subject to a  penalty tax also distributions from qualified contracts are generally subject to withholding eligible rollover distributions from corporate pension profitsharing and hr  plans b plans and governmental  plans are subject to a mandatory federal income tax withholding of  an eligible rollover distribution is any distribution to an employee or employees spouse or former spouse as beneficiary or alternate payee from such a plan except certain distributions such as distributions required by the code distributions in a specified annuity form or hardship distributions the  withholding does not apply however to nontaxable distributions or if the employee chooses a direct rollover from the plan to a taxqualified plan ira or tax sheltered annuity or to a governmental  plan that agrees to separately account for rollover contributions loans loans are available only if the contract if used in a section b qualified plan if the amount or duration of the loan violates internal revenue code requirements then you may be subject to income tax or a penalty irs authorities and the department of labor suggest that in certain circumstances a loan may result in adverse tax and erisa consequences for section b programs a loan issued in connection with a b plan is generally subject to a limit of the lesser of  or  of the participants vested ownership in the b plan the maximum loan amount may be lower if you currently have or have had a plan loan in the last  months in addition the department of labor has issued regulations governing plan participant loans under the retirement plans subject to erisa and the department of labors regulations contain requirements for plan loans relating to their availability amount and other matters these requirements require in part that a loan from an erisagoverned plan be made under a enforceable agreement bear a reasonable rate of interest be adequately secured provide a reasonable payment schedule and be made available on a basis that does not discriminate in favor of employees who are officers or shareholders or who are highly compensated failure to comply with these requirements may result in penalties under the code and erisa you are responsible for determining whether your plan is subject to and complies with erisa and the department of labors regulations governing plan loans you should consult a tax advisor before taking a loan diversification and distribution requirements the internal revenue code provides that the underlying investments for a nonqualified variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements in order to be treated as an annuity the annuity must also meet certain distribution requirements at the death of an owner in order to be treated as an annuity contract these diversification and distribution requirements are discussed in the sai midland may modify the contract to attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment surrenders  nonqualified contracts if you purchase the contract as an individual and not under an individual retirement annuity or other qualified retirement plan your contract is referred to as a nonqualified contract if you make a surrender from a nonqualified contract before the annuity commencement date the internal revenue code treats that surrender as first coming from gain and then from your premium payments when you make a surrender you are taxed on the amount of the surrender that is gain if you make a full surrender you are generally taxed on the amount that your surrender proceeds exceed the investment in the contract which is generally your premiums paid adjusted for any prior partial surrenders that came out of the premiums different rules apply for annuity payments see annuity payments below the internal revenue code also provides that surrendered gain may be subject to a penalty the amount of the penalty is equal to  of the amount that is includable in income some surrenders will be exempt from the penalty this includes any amount o paid on or after the taxpayer reaches age   o paid after an owner dies o paid if the taxpayer becomes totally disabled as that term is defined in the internal revenue code o paid in a series of substantially equal payments made annually or more frequently under a lifetime annuity o paid under an immediate maturity or o which come from premium payments made prior to august   multiple contracts all nonqualified deferred contracts that are issued by midland or its affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year are treated as one annuity for purposes of determining the amount includable in the owners income when a taxable distribution occurs withholding distributions from qualified and nonqualified contracts generally are subject to withholding for your federal income tax liability the withholding rate varies according to the type of distribution and your tax status you will be provided the opportunity to elect not to have tax withheld from distributions annuity payments although the tax consequences may vary depending on the annuity payment option you select in general for nonqualified and certain qualified contracts only a portion of the annuity payments you receive will be includable in your gross income in general the excludable portion of each annuity payment you receive will be determined as follows o fixed payments  by dividing the investment in the contract on the maturity date by the total expected value of the annuity payments for the term of the payments this is the percentage of each annuity payment that is excludable o variable payments  by dividing the investment in the contract on the maturity date by the total number of expected periodic payments this is the amount of each annuity payment that is excludable the remainder of each annuity payment is includable in gross income once the investment in the contract has been fully recovered the full amount of any additional annuity payments is includable in gross income if you select more than one annuity payment option special rules govern the allocation of the contracts entire investment in the contract to each such option for purposes of determining the excludable amount of each payment received under that option we advise you to consult a competent tax advisor as to the potential tax effects of allocation amounts to any particular annuity payment option if after the annuity commencement date annuity payments stop because an annuitant has died the excess if any of the investment in the contract as of the annuity maturity date over the aggregate amount of annuity payments received that was excluded from gross income is generally allowable as a deduction for your last taxable year annuity contracts purchased by nonresident aliens and foreign corporations the discussion above provided general information regarding us federal income tax consequences to annuity owners that are us persons taxable distributions made to owners who are not us persons will generally be subject to us federal income tax withholding at a  rate unless a lower treaty rate applies in addition distributions may be subject to state andor municipal taxes and taxes that may be imposed by the owners country of citizenship or residence prospective foreign owners are advised to consult with a qualified tax advisor regarding us state and foreign taxation for any annuity contract purchase taxation of death benefit proceeds amounts may be distributed from the contract because of the death of an owner or an annuitant generally such amounts should be includable in the income of the recipient o if distributed in a lump sum these amounts are taxed in the same manner as a full surrender or o if distributed under an annuity payment option these amounts are taxed in the same manner as annuity payments transfers assignments or exchange of contracts a transfer of ownership or absolute assignment of a contract the designation of an annuitant or payee or other beneficiary who is not also the owner the selection of certain maturity dates or a change of annuitant may result in certain income or gift tax consequences to the owner that are beyond the scope of this discussion an owner contemplating any such transfer assignment selection or change should contact a competent tax advisor with respect to the potential tax effect s of such a transaction possible tax law changes although the likelihood of legislative changes is uncertain there is always the possibility that the tax treatment of the contract could change by legislation or otherwise you should consult a tax advisor with respect to legal developments and their effect on the contract separate account charges it is possible that the internal revenue service may take a position that fees for certain optional benefits are deemed to be taxable distributions to you although we do not believe that the fees associated with any optional benefit provided under the contract should be treated as taxable surrenders you should consult your tax advisor prior to selecting any optional benefit under the contract maturity date the maturity date is the date on which income payments will begin under the annuity option you have selected the earliest possible maturity date under the contract is the th contract anniversary at which time you may annuitize your surrender value less any premium taxes however by current company practice we will allow you to annuitize after the first contract year if you choose any life income or joint and survivor income payout options after the first contract year we will allow you to annuitize the full accumulation value plus any applicable interest adjustment and less any premium taxes this is not guaranteed if you choose any other payout option after the first contract year you will annuitize your contract for the surrender value an interest adjustment will apply to any value allocated to one or more myg options of the fixed account the maximum maturity date is the contract anniversary immediately following the annuitants th birthday you may change the maturity date by sending written notice to our principal office we must receive your at least  days prior to the original maturity date if you have not previously specified otherwise and have not elected certain systematic withdrawal options then on the maturity date you may  take the accumulation value in one lump sum or  convert the accumulation value into an annuity payable to the annuitant under one of the payment options described below selecting an annuity option you may apply the proceeds of a surrender to effect an annuity unless you choose otherwise your surrender value from the fixed account will be applied to a  year certain and life fixed payout and the surrender value from the separate account will be applied to a  year certain and life variable payout the first monthly annuity payment will be made within one month after the maturity date variable payment options are not available in certain states currently the payment options are only available if the proceeds applied are  or more and the first periodic payment will be at least  we reserve the right to change the payment frequency so that payments are at least  the payees actual age will affect each payment amount for annuity income options involving life income the amount of each annuity payment to older payees will be greater than for younger payees because payments to older payees are expected to be fewer in number for annuity income options that do not involve life income the length of the payment period will affect the amount of each payment with a shorter period the amount of each annuity payment will be greater payments that occur more frequently will be smaller than those occurring less frequently the payee or any other person who is entitled to receive payments may name a beneficiary to receive any amount that we would otherwise pay to that persons estate if that person died the person who is entitled to receive payment may change the beneficiary at any time payment options will be subject to our rules at the time of selection we must approve any arrangements that involve more than one of the payment options or a payee who is not a natural person for example a corporation or a payee who is a fiduciary or an assignee also the details of all arrangements will be subject to our rules at the time the arrangements take effect this includes o rules on the minimum amount we will pay under an option o minimum amounts for installment payments surrender or commutation rights your rights to receive payments over time for which we may offer you a lump sum payment o the naming of people who are entitled to receive payment and their beneficiaries and o the ways of proving age gender and survival you choose a payment option when you apply for a contract and may change it by writing to our principal office you must elect the payment plan at least  days before the maturity date fixed options payments under the fixed options are not affected by the investment experience of any investment division the surrender value as of the maturity date will be applied to the fixed option selected we guarantee interest under the fixed options at a rate of  a year we may also credit interest under the fixed deposit options at a rate that is above the  guaranteed rate this is at our complete discretion thereafter interest or payments are fixed according to the options chosen variable options payments under the variable options will vary in amount depending on the investment experience of the investment divisions after the maturity date variable payment options are not available in certain states the annuity tables contained in the contract are based on a  five percent assumed investment rate this is a fulcrum rate around which variable annuity payments will fluctuate to reflect whether the investment experience of the investment divisions is better or worse than the assumed investment rate if the actual investment experience exceeds the assumed investment rate then the payment will increase conversely if the actual investment experience is less than the assumed rate then payments will decrease we determine the amount of the first monthly variable payment by applying the surrender value in each investment division as of a date not more than  business days prior to the maturity date to the appropriate rate from the annuity tables in the contract for the payout options selected using the payees age and sex where permissible the amount of the first payment will then be used to determine the number of annuity units for each investment division the number of annuity units is used to determine the amount of subsequent variable payments the annuity unit value for each investment division will be initially set at  thereafter the annuity unit value will vary with the investment experience of the investment division and will reflect the mortality and expense risk charge we make at an effective annual rate of   the annuity unit value will increase if the net investment experience investment experience minus the asset charge is greater than the  assumed investment rate the annuity unit value will decrease if the net investment experience is less than the  assumed investment rate the amount of each subsequent variable payment will be determined for each investment division by multiplying the number of annuity units by the annuity unit value additional information on the variable annuity payments is contained in the sai that can be obtained for free by contacting us at our principal office payout options the following four payout options are available  income for specified period we pay installments for a specified period we will pay the amount applied in equal installments plus applicable interest excess interest may be paid at our discretion for a specified time from  up to  years fixed option only  life annuity we will pay the money as monthly income for life you may choose from  of  ways to receive the income a life annuity we will pay equal monthly payments during the lifetime of the payee with a life annuity payment option payments will only be made as long as the payee is alive therefore if the payee dies after the first payment then only one payment will be made b with certain period we will pay equal monthly payments for a selected number of guaranteed payments and then for as long as the payee is living thereafter  income for a specified amount we will pay income of the accumulation value until the principal and interest are exhausted payments will begin on the maturity date and will continue until the principal and interest at the rate of  compounded per annum are exhausted payments must continue for more than  years fixed option only  joint and survivor income we will make monthly payments until the last surviving payees death therefore if both payees die after the first payment then only one payment will be made the annuitant must be at least  years old and the beneficiarypayee must be at least  years old at the time of the first monthly payment annuitization bonus if you decide to annuitize your contract any time after the th contract year we guarantee that we will credit your

number of shares that are allocated to your contract the funds will determine if and how often shareholder meetings are held as we receive notice of these meetings we will ask for your voting instructions the funds are not required to hold a meeting in any given year if we do not receive instructions in time from all contract owners then we currently intend to vote those shares in the same

not be liable for any payments we make prior to recording the written notice of assignment accumulation unit value we determine accumulation unit values for each investment division of our separate account at the end of each business day the accumulation unit value for each investment division was initially set at  the accumulation unit value for any business day is equal to the accumulation unit value for the preceding business day multiplied by the net investment factor for that division on that business day we determine the net investment factor for each investment division every business day as follows o first we take the net asset value per share held in the investment division at the end of the current business day plus the per share amount of any dividends or capital gain distributions on shares held in the investment divisions on the current business day minus the per share amount of any capital loss realized or unrealized on shares held in the investment divisions on the current business day o then we divide this amount by the net asset value per share held in the investment division at the close of business on the preceding business day after giving effect to any contract transactions on that day o then we subtract a daily asset charge for each calendar day between business days for example a monday calculation may include charges for saturday sunday and monday the daily charge is currently  which is an effective annual rate of  this charge is for mortality and expense risks assumed by us under the contract and to cover administrative costs we incur for transactions related to the separate account o finally we reserve the right to subtract any other daily charge for taxes or amounts set aside as a reserve for taxes generally this means that we would adjust unit values to reflect what happens to the funds and also for any charges annuity payments the amount of each fixed annuity payment will be set on the maturity date and will not subsequently be affected by the investment performance of the investment divisions the amount of each variable annuity payment will be affected by the investment performance of the investment divisions variable payment options are not available in certain states the dollar amount of the first monthly variable annuity payment is computed for each investment division by applying the surrender value in the investment division as of a date not more than  business days prior to the maturity date to the appropriate rate for the payout option selected using the age and sex where permissible of the annuitant the number of annuity units for each investment division is then calculated by dividing the first variable annuity payment for that investment division by the investment divisions annuity unit value as of the same date the dollar amount of each subsequent payment from an investment division is equal to the number of annuity units for that investment division times the annuity unit value for that investment division as of a uniformly applied date not more than  business days before the annuity payment is due the payment made to the annuitant for the first payment and all subsequent payments will be the sum of the payment amounts for each investment division the annuity unit value for each investment division was initially set at  the annuity unit value for any business day is equal to  multiplied by  multiplied by  where   the annuity unit value for the preceding business day   the net investment factor as described above for that division on that business day   the investment result adjustment factor  per day which recognizes an assumed interest rate of  per year used in determining the annuity payment amounts transfers after the maturity date will only be allowed twice per contract year and will be made using the annuity unit value for the investment divisions on the date the request for transfer is received on the transfer date the number of annuity units transferred from the investment division is multiplied by the annuity unit value for that investment division to determine the value being transferred this value is then transferred into the indicated investment divisions by converting this value into annuity units of the proper investment divisions the annuity units are determined by dividing the value being transferred into an investment division by the annuity unit value of the investment division on the transfer date the transfer shall result in the same dollar amount of variable annuity payment on the date of transfer calculation of yields and total returns money market investment division yield calculation in accordance with regulations adopted by the securities and exchange commission midland national is required to compute the fidelity vip money market investment divisions called the money market investment division for the purpose of this section current annualized yield for a sevenday period in a manner which does not take into consideration any realized or unrealized gains or losses on shares of the money market investment division or on its portfolio securities this current annualized yield is computed for the money market investment division by determining the net change exclusive of realized gains and losses on the sale of securities and unrealized appreciation and depreciation and income other than investment income in the value of a hypothetical account having a balance of one unit of the money market investment division at the beginning of such sevenday period dividing such net change in account value by the value of the account at the beginning of the period to determine the base period return and annualizing this quotient on a day basis the net change in account value reflects the deductions for the annual maintenance fee the mortality and expense risk charge and income and expenses accrued during the period because of these deductions the yield for the money market investment division of the separate account will be lower than the yield for the money market investment division or any comparable substitute funding vehicle the securities and exchange commission also permits midland national to disclose the effective yield of the money market investment division for the same sevenday period determined on a compounded basis the effective yield is calculated by compounding the unannualized base period return by adding one to the base period return raising the sum to a power equal to  divided by  and subtracting one from the result the yield on amounts held in the money market investment division normally will fluctuate on a daily basis therefore the disclosed yield for any given past period is not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of return the money market investment divisions actual yield is affected by changes in interest rates on money market securities average portfolio maturity of the money market investment divisions or substitute funding vehicle the types and quality of portfolio securities held by the money market investment division or substitute funding vehicle and operating expenses in addition the yield figures are for the base contract and do not reflect the effect of any surrender charge that may be applicable to a particular contract other investment division yield calculations midland national may from time to time disclose the current annualized yield of one or more of the investment divisions except the money market investment divisions for day periods the annualized yield of an investment division refers to income generated by the investment division over a specified day period because the yield is annualized the yield generated by an investment division during the day period is assumed to be generated each day period this yield is computed by dividing the net investment income per accumulation unit earned during the period by the price per unit on the last day of the period according to the following formula yield    a  b       cd where a  net investment income earned during the period by the portfolio or substitute funding vehicle attributable to shares owned by the investment division b  expenses accrued for the period net of reimbursements c  the average daily number of units outstanding during the period d  the maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the period net investment income will be determined in accordance with rules established by the securities and exchange commission accrued expenses will include all recurring fees that are charged to all owner accounts the yield calculations do not reflect the effect of any surrender charges that may be applicable to a particular contract surrender charges range from  to  of the amount of premium withdrawn depending on the elapsed time since the premium was paid because of the charges and deductions imposed by the separate account the yield of the investment division will be lower than the yield for the corresponding portfolio the yield on amounts held in the investment divisions normally will fluctuate over time therefore the disclosed yield for any given past period is not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of return the investment divisions actual yield will be affected by the types and quality of portfolio securities held by the portfolio and its operating expenses standard total return calculations midland national may from time to time also disclose average annual total returns for one or more of the investment divisions for various periods of time average annual total return quotations are computed by finding the average annual compounded rates of return over one five and ten year periods that would equate the initial amount invested to the ending redeemable value according to the following formula p   tn  erv where p  a hypothetical initial payment of  t  average annual total return n  number of years erv  ending redeemable value of a hypothetical  payment made at the beginning of the one five or tenyear period at the end of the one five or tenyear period or fractional portion thereof all recurring fees that are charged to all owner accounts are recognized in the ending redeemable value this includes a contract charges factor that is calculated by taking the daily separate account asset charge and adding an additional amount that adjusts for the current annual  annual maintenance fee this additional amount is based on an anticipated average accumulation value of  so it is calculated as  or  annually the standard average annual total return calculations assume the contract is surrendered and therefore will reflect the effect of surrender charges that may be applicable to a particular period midland national may disclose average annual total returns in various ways depicting whether the contract is surrendered or maintained inforce accordingly midland national may disclose the following types of average annual total return  the contract is surrendered  the contract is not surrendered midland national may from time to time also disclose average annual total returns in a format which assumes that the contract is kept in force through the time period shown such nonstandard returns will be identical to the standard format which assumes the contract is surrendered except that the contingent deferred sales charge percentage will be assumed to be  the nonstandard returns which assume the contract is kept inforce will only be shown in conjunction with standard returns which assume the contract is surrendered cumulative total returns midland national may from time to time also disclose cumulative total returns in conjunction with the annual returns described above the cumulative returns will be calculated using the following formula ctr  ervp   where ctr  the cumulative total return net of investment division recurring charges for the period erv  ending redeemable value of an assumed  payment at the beginning of the one five or tenyear period at the end of the one five or tenyear period or fractional portion thereof p  an assumed initial payment of  the returns which assume the contract is kept inforce will only be shown in conjunction with returns which assume the contract is surrendered midland national may also disclose the value of an assumed payment of  or other amounts at the end of various periods of time adjusted historical performance data midland national may also disclose adjusted historical performance data for an investment division for periods before the investment division commenced operations based on the assumption that the investment division was in existence before it actually was and that the investment division had been invested in a particular portfolio that was in existence prior to the investment divisions commencement of operations the portfolio used for these calculations will be the actual portfolio that the investment division will invest in adjusted historical performance data of this type will be calculated as follows first the value of an assumed  investment in the applicable portfolio is calculated on a monthly basis by comparing the net asset value per share at the beginning of the month with the net asset value per share at the end of the month adjusted for any dividend distributions during the month and the resulting ratio is applied to the value of the investment at the beginning of the month to get the gross value of the investment at the end of the month second that gross value is then reduced by a contract charges factor to reflect the charges imposed under the contract the contract charges factor is calculated by taking the daily separate account asset charge and adding an additional amount that adjusts for the current annual  annual maintenance fee this additional amount is based on an anticipated average accumulation value of  so it is calculated as  or  annually the total is then divided by  to get the monthly contract charges factor which is then applied to the value of the hypothetical initial payment in the applicable portfolio to get the value in the investment division the contract charges factor is assumed to be deducted at the beginning of each month in this manner the ending redeemable value erv of a hypothetical  initial payment in the investment division is calculated each month during the applicable period to get the erv at the end of the period third that erv is then utilized in the formulas above this type of performance data may be disclosed on both an average annual total return and a cumulative total return basis moreover it may be disclosed assuming that the contract is not surrendered ie with no deduction for the contingent deferred sales charge and assuming that the contract is surrendered at the end of the applicable period ie reflecting a deduction for any applicable contingent deferred sales charge federal tax matters taxfree exchanges section  midland national accepts premiums which are the proceeds of a contract in a transaction qualifying for a taxfree exchange under section  of the internal revenue code except as required by federal law in calculating the basis of the contract the company does not differentiate between section  premiums and nonsection  premiums we also accept rollovers from contracts qualifying as individual retirement annuities or accounts iras or any other qualified contract which is eligible to rollover into an ira except b contracts the company differentiates between nonqualified contracts and iras to the extent necessary to comply with federal tax laws required distributions in order to be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes section s of the code requires any nonqualified contract to provide that a if any owner dies on or after the annuity date but prior to the time the entire interest in the contract has been distributed the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of that owners death and b if any owner dies prior to the annuity starting date the entire interest in the contract will be distributed  within five years after the date of that owners death or  as annuity payments which will begin within one year of that owners death and which will be made over the life of the owners designated beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of that beneficiary the owners designated beneficiary is the person to whom ownership of the contract passes by reason of death and must be a natural person however if the owners designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the owner the contract may be continued with the surviving spouse as the new owner the nonqualified contracts contain provisions which are intended to comply with the requirements of section s of the code although no regulations interpreting these requirements have yet been issued we intend to review such provisions and modify them if necessary to assure that they comply with the requirements of code section s when clarified by regulation or otherwise other rules may apply to qualified contracts nonnatural person owners if a nonnatural person eg a corporation or a trust owns a nonqualified contract the taxpayer generally must include in income any increase in the excess of the account value over the investment in the contract generally the premiums or other consideration paid for the contract during the taxable year there are some exceptions to this rule and a prospective owner that is not a natural person should discuss these with a tax adviser the tax discussion in the prospectus and herein generally applies to contracts owned by natural persons diversification requirements the code requires that the investments of each investment division of the separate account underlying the contracts be adequately diversified in order for the contracts to be treated as annuity contracts for federal income tax purposes it is intended that each investment division through the fund in which it invests will satisfy these diversification requirements owner control in some circumstances owners of variable contracts who retain excessive control over the investment of the underlying separate account assets may be treated as owners of those assets and may be subject to tax on income produced by those assets although published guidance in this area does not address certain aspects of the contracts we believe that the owner of a contract should not be treated as the owner of the separate account assets we reserve the right to modify the contracts to bring them into conformity with applicable standards should such modification be necessary to prevent owners of the contracts from being treated as the owners of the underlying separate account assets taxation of qualified contracts the tax rules applicable to qualified contracts vary according to the type of retirement plan and the terms and conditions of the plan your rights under a qualified contract may be subject to the terms of the retirement plan itself regardless of the terms of the qualified contract adverse tax consequences may result if you do not ensure that contributions distributions and other transactions with respect to the contract comply with the law individual retirement accounts iras as defined in section  of the internal revenue code code permit individuals to make annual contributions of up to the lesser of a specific dollar amount or the amount of compensation includible in the individuals gross income for the year the contributions may be deductible in whole or in part depending on the individuals income distributions from certain retirement plans may be rolled over into an ira on a taxdeferred basis without regard to these limits amounts in the ira other than nondeductible contributions are taxed when distributed from the ira a  penalty tax generally applies to distributions made before age   unless certain exceptions apply roth iras as described in code section a permit certain eligible individuals to contribute to make nondeductible contributions to a roth ira in cash or as a rollover or transfer from another roth ira or other ira a rollover from or conversion of an ira to a roth ira is generally subject to tax and other special rules apply the owner may wish to consult a tax adviser before combining any converted amounts with any other roth ira contributions including any other conversion amounts from other tax years distributions from a roth ira generally are not taxed except that once aggregate distributions exceed contributions to the roth ira income tax and a  penalty tax may apply to distributions made  before age   subject to certain exceptions or  during the five taxable years starting with the year in which the first contribution is made to any roth ira a  penalty tax may apply to amounts attributable to a conversion from an ira if they are distributed during the five taxable years beginning with the year in which the conversion was made corporate pension and profitsharing plans under section a of the code allow corporate employers to establish various types of retirement plans for employees and selfemployed individuals to establish qualified plans for themselves and their employees adverse tax consequences to the retirement plan the participant or both may result if the contract is transferred to any individual as a means to provide benefit payments unless the plan complies with all the requirements applicable to such benefits prior to transferring the contract tax sheltered annuities under section b of the code allow employees of certain section c organizations and public schools to exclude from their gross income the premium payments made within certain limits on a contract that will provide an annuity for the employees retirement these premium payments may be subject to fica social security tax distributions of  salary reduction contributions made in years beginning after december    earnings on those contributions and  earnings on amounts held as of the last year beginning before january   are not allowed prior to age   severance from employment death or disability salary reduction contributions may also be distributed upon hardship but would generally be subject to penalties section  plans while not actually providing for a qualified plan as that term is normally used provides for certain deferred compensation plans with respect to service for state governments local governments political subdivisions agencies instrumentalities and certain affiliates of such entities and tax exempt organizations the contract can be used with such plans under such plans a participant may specify the form of investment in which his or her participation will be made

and transfer limitations described above this option will earn interest at the current interest rate the current interest rate on the issue date is shown on the specifications page and is applicable to the initial premium allocated to the traditional fixed account the current interest rate as shown on the specifications page is guaranteed for the first year an interest rate will be declared annually on each contract anniversary for the traditional fixed account we will also declare the current interest rate for any subsequent premiums or amounts transferred to the fixed account the fixed

exceed the maximum transfer charge shown in the specifications page this charge will be deducted from the investment divisions or the fixed account from which the transfer is being made in equal proportion to the number of such investment divisions or the fixed account on the day of the transfer the amount remaining in any investment division after deducting the transfer and any transfer charge must be equal to or greater than zero the maximum amount that can be transferred from the fixed account to the separate account in any contract year is  of the fixed account value on the first day of the contract year you may also request to transfer amounts out of the myg options which will be subject to an interest adjustment subject to the transfer limitations in sections  and  above we reserve the right to restrict or refuse transfers under this contract if we exercise this right you will be notified in writing  transfers after the maturity date you may request two transfers among the separate account investment divisions each contract year no transfers are allowed in or out of the fixed account  account investments we use the assets of our separate account to buy shares in the funds each investment division is invested in a corresponding specific portfolio income and realized and unrealized gains and losses from our shares in each portfolio are credited to or charged against the investment division this is without regard to income gains or losses in our other investment accounts we will always keep assets in the separate account with a total value at least equal to the accumulation values under contracts like this one to the extent those assets do not exceed this amount we use them only to support those policies we do not use those assets to support any other business we conduct we may use any excess over this amount in any way we choose  change in investment policy a portfolio of the funds may make a material change in its investment policy in that case we will send you a notice of the change within  days after you receive the notice or within  days after the effective date of the change if later you may transfer any amount you have in the investment division affected by the investment policy change to another investment division of our separate account the process for changing the investment policy of the separate account has been approved by iowa our state of domicile and the process for doing so is on file with the insurance commissioner in the state in which this contract is delivered  change of fund a portfolio might in our judgment become unsuitable for investment by an investment division this may happen because of a change in investment contract or a change in laws or regulations or because the shares are no longer available for investment or for some other reason if that occurs we have the right to substitute another portfolio of the funds or to invest in a fund other than the ones we show on the application however we would first seek approval from the sec and where required the insurance regulator where this contract is delivered section  accumulation values  fixed account value the fixed account value equals  your initial premium allocated to the fixed account plus  subsequent premiums allocated to the fixed account if any plus or minus  any transfers in or out of the fixed account options before any applicable interest adjustment less  any partial surrenders allocated to the fixed account options before any applicable interest adjustment if allocated in the myg options or reduction of surrender charges less  the annual maintenance fee and transfer charges if any plus  interest credited at the specified interest rate for each fixed account option  separate account value the amount you have in our separate account at any time will be the sum of the values in each investment division the value in each investment division is equal to a multiplied by b where a is the accumulation unit value as of the end of the valuation period for which the value in the investment division is determined b is the number of accumulation units in the investment division we guarantee that adverse mortality and expense experience will not affect the amount you have in our separate account  accumulation units we will credit amounts to or deduct amounts from the investment divisions in the separate account c in the form of accumulation units prior to the maturity date the number of accumulation units to be credited or deducted from any investment division will be determined by dividing the amount to be credited or deducted from the investment division by the accumulation unit value of the investment division accumulation units will be credited or deducted using the unit value for the valuation period during which the transaction occurs  accumulation unit value the accumulation unit value of each investment division was set at  on the first valuation period of the investment division the accumulation unit value for each subsequent valuation period is determined at the end of the valuation period and will be equal to the net investment factor for that valuation period multiplied by the accumulation unit value for the immediately preceding valuation period the accumulation unit value for a valuation period applies to each day in the period the accumulation unit value may increase or decrease from one valuation period to the next  net investment factor the net investment factor is an index used to measure the investment performance of an investment division from one valuation period to the next the net investment factor can be greater or less than one therefore the value of an investment division unit may increase or decrease the net investment factor for each investment division for a valuation period is determined by adding a and b subtracting c and then dividing the result by a where a is the value of the assets at the end of the preceding valuation period b is the investment income and capital gains realized or unrealized credited during the current valuation period and c is the sum of  the capital losses realized or unrealized charged during the current valuation period plus any amount charged or set aside for taxes during the current valuation period plus  the mortality and expense charge for each day in the current valuation period  charges against the investment division in determining the values for the accumulation units we deduct the mortality and expense charge as shown on the specifications page from the assets of each investment division this charge is for mortality and expense risks that we assume the earnings of the separate account are taxed as part of our operations at the present time we do not expect to incur taxes on earnings of any investment division to the extent that earnings are credited under this contract if we incur additional taxes due to the operation of the separate account we may make charges for such taxes against the investment divisions   section  surrenders  surrender you may surrender this contract for its surrender value at any time prior to the maturity date the surrender value will be determined as of the first business day that we receive written notice and the contract we may defer payment of the surrender value for up to six months if payment is deferred for  or more days interest at the rate required by the jurisdiction in which this contract is delivered will be paid during the period of deferment  surrender value the surrender value is equal to  the fixed account value plus  any applicable interest adjustments plus  the separate account value less  the surrender charge less  the annual maintenance fee if any less  any applicable premium tax  interest adjustment we may make an interest adjustment on amounts withdrawn from any multiyear guarantee option before the end of the guarantee period each myg option will have a separate interest adjustment an applicable interest adjustment will be calculated by multiplying the amount withdrawn before the reduction of any surrender charge by the formula described below io    itt   io  the current interest rate on the myg options excluding any additional interest when this contract was issued it  the current interest rate on the myg options excluding any additional interest offered for new contracts t time in years as follows number of days from the date of the partial or full surrender to the end of the current contract year divided by  plus whole number of years remaining in the guarantee period upon full surrender or full transfer out of an myg options an interest adjustment either positive or negative will be limited to the difference between the myg options account value and the minimum guaranteed fund value an interest adjustment will be made on each myg option during the guarantee period on a full or partial surrender penaltyfree surrender transfers out of the myg option and upon annuitization no interest adjustment will be made upon death or at the end of the guarantee period when the myg option money is automatically transferred to the traditional fixed account  minimum guaranteed fund value the minimum guaranteed fund value mgfv is only applied to the myg options and will be no less than   of myg premiums less  any partial surrenders allocated to or any transfers out of the myg options before any applicable interest adjustments or reduction of surrender charges plus  interest earned at the fixed account guaranteed minimum interest rate shown on the specifications page less  the annual maintenance fee and transfer charges if any  surrender charges we may deduct a surrender charge from any surrender of premiums the charge is equal to  the net premium less  the penaltyfree partial surrender amount if available multiplied by  the surrender charge percentage shown on the specifications page the surrender charge will be based on the length of

which this contract is delivered will be paid during the period of deferment unless you specify otherwise your partial surrender will be allocated among all investment divisions the traditional fixed account and the myg options in the same proportion as your accumulation value bears to each investment division the traditional fixed account and the myg optionss this allocation is subject to minimum amount requirements  penaltyfree partial surrenders once in each contract year you may withdraw up to  of the gross premium as of the date of the partial surrender without any surrender charge if this option is not exercised during any contract year or if less than  is withdrawn any unused amount will not be carried over to a subsequent contract year an interest adjustment will be applied to penaltyfree partial surrenders if money is withdrawn from the myg options  surrender charges we will deduct a surrender charge upon any partial surrender in excess of the allowable penaltyfree partial surrender the charge is equal to  the amount requested that is withdrawn from net premium less  the penaltyfree partial surrender amount if available multiplied by  the surrender charge percentage shown on the specifications page the surrender charge will be based on the length of time between premium payments and partial surrenders for the purpose of determining the surrender charge any amount that you withdraw will be treated as being from premiums first and then from investment income if any without regard to allocations of premiums or surrenders among investment divisions there is no surrender charge on the investment income if any withdrawn iii section  systematic withdrawal option you may elect a systematic withdrawal option if all of the following requirements are satisfied as

in which they fall surrender charges will apply to all systematic withdrawal amounts that are in excess of the penaltyfree partial surrender amount you may discontinue systematic withdrawals at any time the balance remaining in the accumulation value will continue to increase or decrease depending on the investment experience of the investment divisions in which your accumulation value resides

find the right life insurance coverage for you get quick and easy life insurance quotes life insurance why it matters and how to shop for it you work hard to provide a good life for your family and youd do anything to protect them but what would happen to them financially if you died tomorrow if the answer troubles you then you need life insurance life insurance provides a safety net tomorrow for the loved ones who depend on you today but where should you start there are two main types of coverage are available term life and permanent life insurance the first step is to decide which of these suits you best term vs permanent life insurance term life insurance covers you for a certain period such as   or  years buyers typically choose a policy that covers them until their mortgages and other debts are paid off or the kids have graduated from college and are living independently term life is fairly straightforward compared to permanent life and its less expensive than a permanent life policy the average cost of a year  term life policy for a healthy yearold is about  a year roughly the cost of one latte per week according to limra and the life foundation a term life policy pays out if you die during the term while the coverage is in effect then your beneficiary collects the proceeds called the death benefit you cant cash in the policy while youre still alive with term life you risk buying something that your family might never end up using but in return you gain the peace of mind of knowing theyd be ok if you died unexpectedly permanent life insurance such as whole life or universal life covers you for the rest of your life the policy pays the death benefit to your beneficiary whether you die tomorrow or in  years permanent life insurance also includes an investment component known as cash value the cash value of the policy starts off small and then gradually grows taxfree if you hold onto the policy for many years the cash account becomes a nest egg you can borrow from the cash value  the policy stays in effect as long as you repay the money plus interest  or surrender the policy for the cash because of its cash value and lifelong coverage permanent life insurance is pricier and more complex than term life some policies even provide longterm care benefits which type of life insurance should you buy choose term life insurance if you need coverage only until a certain age say the age when your youngest child graduates college have no dependents who will need financial help for the rest of their lives dont own a family business or have a large estate to protect want the most affordable type of coverage available choose permanent life insurance if you want to provide for lifelong dependents such as a child with special needs need to protect a large estate or family business from estate taxes want to leave a legacy want to provide loved ones with money for your final expenses such as medical bills and funeral costs no matter when you die how much life insurance should you buy beware of easy formulas such as multiplying your annual income by a certain number instead do a thorough needs analysis determine how much your family would need to pay your final expenses such as funeral costs and how much your loved ones would need over the long haul to maintain their quality of life consider big expenses such as paying off the mortgage and other debts and funding your childrens college educations both parents should be insured  not just the primary breadwinner to determine the amount of insurance for a stayathome parent consider how much it would cost to replace the services that parent provides such as day care and other household tasks dont assume your group life insurance through work will provide all the coverage you need most group life policies are small and the coverage ends when your job ends roughly four in  insured married people depend solely on group life policies according to limra life insurance rates life insurance premiums vary according to the type of policy amount of coverage and the insurer as well as your age and health thats why its important to buy coverage sooner rather than later the longer you wait the higher the premiums will be and the greater the risk that you could develop a health condition that will disqualify you from coverage besides comparing policies evaluate
