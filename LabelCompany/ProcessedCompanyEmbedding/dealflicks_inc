that script by graham winfrey graham winfrey is a staff writer for inccom he previously covered alternative investments at private equity international magazine prior to which he worked at business insider and msnbccom he lives in brooklyn new york grahamwinfrey staff writer incgrahamwinfrey write a comment from left ellar coltrane ethan hawke in boyhood credit ifc films shaking up the us movie business with an innovative startup is like trying to make it as an actor your odds are so low that it can seem foolish to even try  while startups like kickstarter and indiegogo have helped celebrities fund some lowbudget projects such as zach braffs wish i was here and spike lees da sweet blood of jesus crowdfunding has yet to have a significant impact on the industry why hollywoods longrunning assembly line which churns out movies by attaching cast and crew to film scripts continues to serve the industry well changing the way this business manufactures its products isat least for the time beingclose to impossible after production wraps however the opportunities for innovation begin to present themselves in the same way that digital video has replaced celluloid in the cameras used to shoot movies digital technology is transforming the way films are distributed there is no question that the theatrical distribution model is about as inefficient as any business model that exists says film producer john sloss both in terms of knowing who the audience is and filling seats an entertainment industry multihyphenate with experience in virtually every aspect of the business sloss has worked in movies as a lawyer producer distributor and financier on films ranging from boyhood to exit through the gift shop to the fog of war after starting new yorkbased film advisory firm cinetic media in  sloss has gone on to found digital distribution companies filmbuff in  and producers distribution agency in  one problem with the theatrical distribution model is that movie studios spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year promoting filmsthe largest fixed cost that comes with releasing a moviewithout having any real way to target their marketing efforts until studios can gain better insights into specific consumers film preferences the spray and pray advertising model seems to be the prevailing strategy  one startup trying to solve this problem is san franciscobased movielala which operates as both a social network for film fans and a marketing platform for movie studios founded in  the company sends text messages and emails with movie trailers and other promotional content directly to users based on their specific film tastes part of the lure for consumers is getting a first look at movie previews and other early clips of unreleased films for studios movielalas data and analytics help with things like seeing which video ads users are watching and which theyre closing out of early the studios need to know about their customer and their customer behavior and as the younger generation moves into the ipad and mobile space that really should become more of their focus says movielala cofounder dana loberg  dana loberg back left and the entire movielala team in san francisco armed with data on which ads generate a better response from viewers studios can custom tailor their marketing and social media campaigns according to loberg based on how the first teaser trailer does and how people are engaging with it they can modify or change other trailers she says amazon and ebay are masters of recommending products for you to buy but when it comes to film you dont know because so much of it is traditional like a random commercial or a banner ad on yahoo movielala has raised more than  million in funding from investors including salesforce ceo marc benioff and machinima cofounder allen debevoise the eightperson company has more than  million users and is generating revenue from partnerships with four major studios paramount universal legendary and skydance a production company founded in  that coproduces and cofinances movies with paramount pictures at skydance we cant build a premiere nextgeneration studio if we do not remain constantly open to exploring new platforms that help us create better experiences for our audiences says jesse sisgold coo of skydance media while its too early to know how much studios will actually benefit in the long term from partnering with movielala the fact that their marketing departments are using the service is a form of validation argues loberg it shows that there is change thats happening she says a new revenue stream one of the greatest new opportunities in the movie business has nothing to do with the marketing distribution or theatrical exhibition of films since  los angelesbased startup zefr has been generating revenue off of film clips posted on youtube by fans who dont own the rights to the content instead of forcing these individuals to take down pirated videos posted online zefr arranges for advertisements to play before the clips creating a revenue stream it splits with the studios and media companies that own the rights to the content   founded as movie clips in  zefr rebranded in  the company had recently expanded into music sports and television content and needed a name that wouldnt associate the startup just with movies in addition to handling rights management for studios such as universal and warner brothers zefr generates revenue from videos posted online for brands including adidas nike and american express the company has  total employees across its four offices in los angeles new york chicago and provo utah zefr cofounder zach james speaks at the film independent film forum at the directors guild of america in los angelescredit getty images in order to find film clips posted online zefr built proprietary technology that works within youtubes content id systems to track down movie footage we knew we were onto something when the antipiracy guys at the studios said they were getting exhausted by all of the whackamole activity says zefr cofounder zach james who previously worked as an investment banker at credit suisse zefr has raised roughly  million in funding half of which came via a series d round last year led by institutional venture partners an investor in dropbox snapchat and twitter the investment reportedly valued the company at between  million and  million other investors include us venture partners shasta ventures and first round capital today zefr manages roughly  million online videos and tracks more than  billion videos per month in addition to selling advertisements against video clips zefr also analyzes its data to build intelligence about its clients fans in september of  the company acquired socialmedia advertising startup engodo which helps brands partner with the people posting videos and other content on vine instagram pinterest snapchat youtube facebook and twitter  a priceline for movie tickets  even if movie studios can generate new revenue streams from video ads they still struggle with declining ticket revenues us ticket sales have fallen  percent since  from  billion to  billion last year according to movieindustry data site thenumberscom  one startup trying to reverse this trend is los angelesbased dealflicks which describes itself as priceline for movie tickets founded in  the company partners with theater chains to offer discounts on tickets and concessions the discounts can run as high as  percent and dealflicks charges theaters between  percent and  percent of ticket sales that may seem like a tough sell but consider that  percent of movie theater seats are left empty every day and the proposition for theater owners becomes compelling today dealflicks has partnerships with more than  theaters across the us but getting those customers was not easy its a very oldschool industry so you need to get in there and get some face time to execute a deal says dealflicks cofounder kevin hong who spent more than two years driving around the country in a van to meet facetoface with theater owners it took hong almost a year to sign up dealflicks first  theaters but since then the rate of new partnerships has been accelerating the companys revenue grew from  in  to nearly  million last year  part of the inaugural class of the warner brothers startup incubator media camp disney runs a similar program called disney accelerator dealflicks has raised  million from groups including  startups siemer ventures and be great partners the person startup has a common investor with movielala in larry braitman a founding investor in social movie site flixster dealflicks plans to use its data to help predict attendance and collaborate more closely with its theater partners to optimize discount offerings it also intends to spread into canada and other international markets though the company has yet to reach profitability hong expects the business to turn a profit before the end of  appetite for curation when it comes to the digital distribution of movies and tv shows few companies have been as influential as netflix while the companys massive library of titles has helped it dominate the streaming video market smaller streaming companies are winning market share by offering movies and tv shows not available on netflix  one such company is mubi a videoondemand subscription service founded in  the company has dual headquarters in london and san francisco with offices in munich mexico city and istanbul  mubis streaming video service for the ipad mubi adds one new film per day to its library and offers each of its titles for  days so at any given time there are  films to choose from the monthly fee is  in the us € in europe and £ in the uk mubi operates on the premise that too much choice actually frustrates customers many of whom prefer to have quality films chosen for them there is so much content available nowadays that it can be overwhelming says mubi founder efe cakarel the more you have the harder it is to choose so we curate   the company has raised  million in funding almost entirely from individual investors including former goldman sachs copresident jon winkelried tech investment firm silver lakes simon patterson and film producer eric fellner cochair of working title films  mubi is available in  countries online and for ios android playstation samsung smart tvs and amazon fire as of january the streaming service had been downloaded more than  million times one of the keys to mubis business model is its ability to keep acquisition costs low we only need to license  films a year per territory and negotiate in day windows cakarel says the windows refer to the day periods during which mubi is allowed to stream each movie for the rights holder it means they can still exploit other revenue streams and not fear cannibalization with so many constituencies of film fans hungry for a wide variety of films across subject matter and geography the opportunity for new curated streaming companies seems significant while mubi is not yet profitable cakarel says he sinks every dollar of revenue back into the business a strategy he says hes borrowing from amazon founder jeff bezos i think its more important to be able to prove that a model is working that you can see revenue and that you created something that people find valuable he says   back to the future though silicon valleybased startups like movielala and mubi seem poised to help change the way films are marketed and distributed its still early days in terms of the digital revolutions impact on hollywood why the bulk of marketing and distribution revenue continues to come from traditional channels according to marc schiller founder and ceo of new yorkbased marketing and distribution company bond strategy and influence the future might be in a lot of the innovation thats coming out of silicon valley schiller says but that doesnt mean that the current revenue is there  while hollywood executives may be waiting for the money to catch up with the technology the major change that has already reached every corner of the movie business is the transition to digital consumption the theatrical experience is still an important part of the mix but its viable for fewer and fewer films schiller says audiences know that through their mobile device they can access anything they want and i think we have to shift towards that being the reality so do more opportunities exist for startups to save hollywood from the outdated studio system producers distribution agencys sloss says the answer is yes so long as entrepreneurs can partner directly with artists if the th century was about the studios which controlled the physical plant and the financing and the distribution to me the st century is going to be about the talent he says thats what the
