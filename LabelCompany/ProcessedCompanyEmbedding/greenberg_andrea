sustained performance reflects the unparalleled presence we’ve built throughout our market thanks to our exclusive live content and critically acclaimed original programming which continue to be a valuable differentiator for our viewers and partners our commitment to programming excellence was recognized once again this past february with  new york emmy nominations including  for msg network alone more than any other television network or station for the tenth consecutive year our award winning content is led by our live professional sports programming and for the  ‘ nba and nhl regular seasons which concluded last month msg and msg plus delivered over  live games of the new york knicks rangers and islanders new jersey devils and buffalo sabres msg networks also served as the local home to  first round playoff games between the rangers and the montreal canadians our worldclass announcers and analysts provided viewers with indepth coverage of the team with specials such as quest for the cup a onehour playoff preview show as well as dayofgame coverage which will continue for the entire rangers postseason run in addition to our team coverage msg and msg plus continued to deliver a lineup of critically acclaimed original programming including the msg hockey show a weekly program highlighting the hottest stories in hockey and the sixth season of beginnings our

york sports and next month msg networks will debut a new halfhour program airing all summer long that will offer a lighthearted look at the confluence of sports pop culture and social media the strength and popularity of our content has driven new opportunities in digital distribution including with msg go our live streaming and ondemand product in february we announced an agreement with the nhl for the live streaming of local nhl telecasts since then we have reached agreements for msg go with verizon fios service electric and rcn which have joined comcast and altice in making msg go available to subscribers who receive msg networks we continue to have discussions with our other affiliates and anticipate that over time msg go will be provided by all msg networks distributors we have also been actively exploring new opportunities for digital distribution with both existing affiliates and new entrants we hope to have more to share in the coming months as we remain thoughtful about how we approach new distribution opportunities ensuring they make both financial and strategic sense turning to affiliate results in our third quarter we again delivered affiliate revenue growth reflecting higher affiliate fees partially offset by lower subscribers with respect to our viewing subscribers we experienced a low singledigit percentage decrease in our fiscal third quarter as compared with the prior year period however for the fourth successive quarter we saw an improvement in this yearoveryear percentage rate of decline in summary we are pleased with both our financial results and with the important strategic progress we have made so far this year and looking ahead remain confident in our ability to continue to create longterm value for our shareholders i will now turn the call over to bret who will take you through our financial results bret richter thank you andrea and good morning everyone i would like to start by going through our results for the third quarter of fiscal  as compared with the prior year quarter total revenues of  million for the third quarter increased  million or approximately  this included a  million increase in affiliate revenue and a  decrease in advertising revenue the increase in affiliate revenue was primarily due to higher affiliate rates partially offset by the impact of a low singledigit percentage decline in subscribers versus the prior year period and the absence of the impact of a favorable affiliate adjustment recorded in the prior year period the decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to a higher net increase in deferred revenue related to ratings guarantees partially offset by increased sales from the telecast of live professional sports programming as compared with the prior year quarter excluding the impact of the favorable affiliate adjustment recorded in the prior year quarter fiscal  third quarter total company revenues increased  million or  as compared with the prior year period direct operating expenses of  million increased  million or  as compared with the prior year quarter the increase was primarily due to higher rights fees expense partially offset by other programmingrelated cost decreases sga expenses of  million increased approximately  million or  as compared with the prior year period the increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits partially offset by other net decreases adjusted operating income of  million increased  as compared with the prior year period this increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues partially offset by higher direct operating expenses and sga expenses excluding the impact of the favorable affiliate adjustment recorded in the prior year quarter fiscal  third quarter adjusted operating income of  million increased  million or  as compared with the prior year quarter with respect to our balance sheet as of march   total cash and cash equivalents were  million total debt outstanding was  billion and our  million revolver remained undrawn at quarter’s end we made principal payments of  million during the march quarter comprised of a mandatory quarterly amortization payment of  million in accordance with the terms of our credit agreement as well as a  million voluntary principal prepayment please note that our credit facility provides for a total of  million dollars in mandatory principal payments over the next  months as of march   net debt was approximately  billion and our net leverage ratio was reduced to  times trailing  months adjusted operating income our average interest rate for the quarter was approximately  reported free cash flow from continuing operations for the nine months ended march   was  million i will now turn the call back over to ari ari danes thanks bret christy can we open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and your first question comes from brandon ross with btig brandon ross the first one is in your press release you speak to digital rights giving you new opportunities to distribute and monetize your content can you expound on what those upcoming opportunities may be and are wireless carriers a potential opportunity i know verizon offers nba league pass for free and the nfl is something like that an opportunity for you guys and i have another one after andrea greenberg brandon as far as digital opportunities i think they’re multifold first as we’ve said in our prepared remarks we’re  we continue to talk to our existing affiliates and new entrants into the business i think we call them vmvpds about carrying our networks and we hope to have more to say to you in the coming months we’re in active dialogue with many of them right now and we will hopefully conclude deals but all deals obviously need to make financial and strategic sense for us on the digital side also we talked a lot about msg go and we’re very excited about the prospect for msg go we now have a full complement of digital rights for our nba nhl and other professional and nonprofessional programming we’re expanding our distribution we’ve added since our last call verizon fios apropos to your wireless carrier verizon fios we’ve added service electric rcn we are talking to all our other affiliates about adding and hopefully that will be accomplished before the beginning of the next season and as that distribution expands we see significantly improved take rate we’re really pleased with what we’ve been doing from a user acceptance perspective and as we’ve talked about in the past that provides us with all sorts of monetization opportunities we are inserting advertising we can insert different advertising we’re selling sponsorships so we’re really really excited about our digital distribution opportunities brandon ross and then just following up on that one are wireless operators an opportunity there andrea greenberg i mean sure we have a broad range of rights and we  that we can exploit wireless is one way we can exploit them but obviously we have to look at the offer the pricing the packaging before we move forward brandon ross okay and then my second question the mvpd universe has changed quite a bit since msg spun out of msgn has your opinion on whether it makes sense for a cable network to be a standalone entity changed that time there’s obviously been some speculation in the press about you guys starting to consider selling andrea greenberg sure well we really believe in the value of our programming and the ability of our team to drive value for shareholders here as a standalone company the goal of our separation from the msg  from the madison square garden company was so that we could separately exploit our own business plan and we’re doing that i think we are unique we offer live sports programming it’s different from other categories of programming when viewers want to watch us there’s only one way to watch us and that’s live and that’s a scarce and valuable asset that we provide our affiliates so we think we’re wellpositioned for future success operator your next question comes from bryan goldberg with bank of america bryan goldberg i had a question on advertising i know it’s a small part of your business but was wondering if you could share some more color on what drove the decline in the quarter for example how much was ratings across which teams is there anything structural going on we should think about and then if there’s any other pieces driving the decline you could share that would be great andrea greenberg sure bret do you want to bret richter sure bryan let me see if i can add some color so there were several moving parts in the quarter we benefited from higher per game advertising sales for live sports telecasts and we believe this reflects the continued strong demand from advertisers for our content on the other hand the mix of games relative to last year changed we had  fewer knicks telecasts we had some additional nhl telecasts that partially offset that but the fewer knicks games this year versus last year was definitely a factor but you mentioned it most notably ratings were a factor lower ratings in the quarter resulted in a higher net increase in our deferred revenue given our ratings guarantees so that netted against some of the success we had with the pergame sales there were also some really modest changes in our other advertising revenues but the game count the per game sales and the ratings are really the drivers andrea greenberg and let me say that the oncourt performance this year of the knicks most certainly had an impact on our overall ratings we do believe that as the team improves that we have significant ratings and revenue upsides going forward bryan goldberg that’s helpful and i actually had one followup on msg go having just activated the service for fios rcn and service electric i think you just mentioned better take rates of the service but i was wondering is there any other if there’s any other color you could share in terms of how consumption on this platform has actually trended over the last few months how should we be thinking about the ramp there and then what else can you do as an organization aside from activating other affiliates to drive more usage on that platform andrea greenberg sure a couple of things the take rates have been up significantly and i can tell you for the months i’m just looking at some stats for the months of april through march through april when we added nhl and increased our distribution the number of unique users was up by over  so we are very very optimistic that particularly in this market where you have high commutation that msg go will provide us with incremental subscribers incremental viewership you may also notice if you’ve ever used the app that we’ve recently added a title sponsor so we have lexus is our main sponsor so sponsorship opportunities as the take rate increases as the distribution increases will be something that we will be exploiting so we’re really excited about msg go and incremental viewership and monetization opportunities going forward operator your next question is from alexia quadrani with jp morgan david karnovsky this is david karnovsky on for alexia just a question on affiliate sales the revenue you booked for the march quarter is that based on subs through march  or is that on a lag basis andrea greenberg that’s on a lag basis a day lag david karnovsky day lag andrea greenberg yes david karnovsky okay and then just separately on the  million prepayment of your term loan in the quarter just wondering what the rationale was behind that and whether we can expect you to further prepay any other term loan in future quarters bret richter sure david i’m not going to make a forwardlooking statement but the voluntary prepayment was consistent with our stated goal of deleveraging the balance sheet as of the end of march we’ve got leverage down about x we took a little more than a turn since the spinoff and we’re going to continue to manage the balance sheet to manage interest expense by reducing our outstanding debt i mean part of that is through our mandatory prepayments as i mentioned we have  million in the next year one of the things that we could point to as the next step down on our credit facility in terms of picking up another  point of interest expense to  times so that’s a number we watch but more importantly we’re managing a number of factors including the company’s overall financial flexibility our  the covenants under the credit facility have a formula about how much of our cash in our balance sheet we could actually use in our net debt calculation by paying  million we utilized more of the cash in our balance sheet efficiently and going forward all opportunities are within the spectrum of analysis this as we mentioned on prior calls this management team at this company and others have employed numerous financial strategies and as we see opportunities to manage the liquidity of the business for the benefit of shareholders they get due consideration operator your next question comes from benjamin swinburne with morgan stanley bronson kussin it’s actually bronson kussin on for ben you mentioned the improvement in the subtrends in the prepared remarks but i was wondering if you could provide any more details on that improvement is that lower adoption of skinny bundles or is  a greater benefit maybe from minimum guarantees and then a connected question have you seen the acceleration the divergence between viewing and paying subs thanks andrea greenberg without getting into specifics what we have said is that this is the fourth quarter in a row that we’ve seen an improvement in the yearoveryear percentage rate of decline in our viewing subscribers i think it’s important to note that these are actual viewing subscribers these are subscribers before the benefit of any of our contractual minimum protections and for additional color i can also tell you that the percentage decline is significantly improved relative to where we were in q  in q a year ago so i hope that helps operator your next question comes from david joyce with evercore isi david joyce so obviously from where we sit we have imperfect knowledge on when your affiliate contracts come due and we could estimate when they come due but you could always negotiate ahead of time but given the concerns over the carriage minimums and cordcutting but offset by these new ancillary services you’re offering how should we think about how you’re discussing your value proposition with the distributors is there anything incremental that you’re working on collaboratively with them andrea greenberg well the value proposition i think we continue to reinforce we have a unique and what i consider and our distributors consider a compelling product with live professional sports in this market we have these rights locked up for the long term we have a broad spectrum of rights so we’re always talking to our affiliates about things that drive value in their bundle new product offerings and the like david joyce do they express concern of the viewership levels new versus the subscriber base and are there other areas where you could look for more distribution like the sports only over the top services andrea greenberg well we  as we’ve said we have great relationships with our affiliate partners we always talk about things that makes sense for all of us we continue to show affiliate revenue growth and we continue to iterate with them we feel quite comfortable with the terms of our affiliation agreements we have long standing relationships with them consider them our long term partners and feel pretty good about being able to continue to indiscernible operator your final question comes from john janedis with jefferies mike russo this is actually mike russo on for john just first can you talk a little bit about the impact of the rangers’ first round playoff series particularly on advertising in q and to what extent has this helped to clean up any inventory issues you may have had coming out of q andrea greenberg go ahead bret bret richter mike i’ll take that we’re not ready to report q yet and the impact of the rangers’ playoffs and the associated advertising will impact that quarter but what i can tell you is that we have strong advertiser demand and there was a lot of excitement around the series and as the rangers progressed the excitement continues we were impacted by lower ratings as compared to last season and as you may know starting this year our first round playoff games were not exclusive to msg networks but while this had an impact on ratings i note that we  the vast majority of the viewers of the playoffs watched the games on our networks and we think it’s a testament to the affinity of our local viewers and our viewers have the local coverage and in particular our announcers and talentwe’ll talk more specifically about the dollars and cents when we report q mike russo got you and then just as a really quick follow up i was wondering if you could provide us with an update on what percentage of your footprint is up for renewal in this calendar year andrea greenberg right we haven’t provided specifics in that regard but we  but what we can tell you is that our affiliate agreements are typically for multiple years they have staggered expirations they have built in escalators so there is a cycle operator i will now turn the call back over to ari danes for any additional or closing remarks ari danes thanks for joining us we look forward to speaking with you on our yearend conference call have a good day
