his son percy opened their marine underwriting business in the seaport district of new york city having collected  from each of  prominent merchants to start their venture they focused initially on insuring ships and cargoes the chubbs were adept at turning risk into success often by helping their policyholders prevent disasters before they occurred by the turn of the century chubb had established strong relationships with the insurance agents and brokers who placed their clients’ business with chubb underwriters chubb  son did not value size in itself but regarded it as a measure of what had been achieved upon the companys th anniversary in  hendon chubb — who had joined his older brother percy in the firm in  — noted i think there is perhaps a tendency in american business to

and oconnor philadelphia pa for pacific indemnity company robert leigh hebb eric michael leppo semmes bowen and semmes pc baltimore md for clay h whaley betty sue diener marks oneill obrien and courtney pc towson md for compton  sons memorandum opinion j frederick motz district judge in a memorandum opinion i issued on june   i denied thirdparty defendant compton  sons motion for summary judgment pac indem co v whaley  fsuppd   dmd compton  sons compton has moved for me to reconsider two of my conclusions  that the economic loss doctrine does not shield compton from tort liability and  that thirdparty plaintiff whaleys indemnification claim must survive summary judgment because plaintiff pacific indemnity companys complaint did not specifically allege that whaley was actively negligent compton mem at  for the reasons that follow i will deny comptons motion for reconsideration i the economic loss doctrine prohibits a plaintiff from recovering in tort for purely economic losses—losses that involve neither a clear danger of physical injury or death nor damage to property other than the product itself morris v osmose wood preserving  md   ad    the maryland court of appeals has further explained that economic losses include such things as the loss of value or use of the product itself the cost to repair or replace the product or the lost profits resulting from the loss of use of the product aj decoster co v westinghouse electric corp  md   ad    in my june  memorandum opinion i concluded that the product that compton was providing was the replacement of the van agtmaels roof and thus that the economic loss doctrine does not shield compton from tort liability because the physical damage in the instant case was to property other than the roof under construction pac indem co  fsuppd at  n  compton argues that i erred in reaching this conclusion contending that the product was the van agtmaels entire house and thus that all of the damages in the instant case are economic loss damages including but not limited to the roof the walls the ceilings the floors the utilities and the contents comptons mot for recons at  a the majority of the maryland cases that have addressed the economic loss doctrine are not helpful in resolving whether the damages in the instant case constitute property damage or economic loss because in those cases there clearly had been no property damage in decoster however the maryland court of appeals did address whether the damages sought constituted property damage or economic loss decoster  ad at  the plaintiff a commercial chicken and egg producer had suffered loss of more than  chickens as a result of a power failure that interrupted the power supply to the ventilation system in plaintiffs chicken houses id at  plaintiff filed suit against the manufacturer of the allegedly defective transfer switch which had failed to activate the emergency backup power system id the court explained that under whitingturner decosters ability to pursue an action in tort against westinghouse for the loss of its chickens turns upon whether its damages are considered physical harm or economic losses and if the latter whether the defective switch caused a dangerous condition creating a risk of death or personal injury to humans id at  the court concluded that it need not reach the second part of this determination because the death of the chickens is a loss of physical property rather than economic loss decoster does not seek to recover for the loss of value of the switch or its replacement or repair costs nor does it seek recovery of lost profits from its diminished egg production these are all economic losses instead decoster seeks only the replacement of property that was damaged by the alleged defectiveness of the product manufactured by westinghouse id similarly in national coach works of virginia v detroit diesel corp  fsuppd   dmd judge blake of this court held that under maryland law the purchaser of a bus could recover in tort from the manufacturer of the bus engine for damage to the bus after the buss engine caught fire and destroyed the bus the court held that although the economic loss doctrine barred recovery for the engine itself because it was the defective product maryland law plainly permitted recovery for other property damaged by the engine including the bus id the court relied on the maryland court of appeals holding in decoster and the fact that the united states supreme court in saratoga fishing co v jm martinac  co  us    sct   ledd   had cited decoster for the principle that while recovery in tort is not permitted for damage to the defective item itself recovery in tort is permitted for damage to items added to or used in conjunction with a defective item    id b as compton correctly points out the above maryland case law does not directly address whether a house and its contents are considered other property for purposes of determining whether an allegedly negligent roof contractor is liable in tort for damages to them compton reply at  for this reason compton contends that maryland law is ripe for a decision that would broaden the scope of what would be considered economic loss by following what compton submits is the modern trend in economic loss doctrine jurisprudence precluding tort liability where damage to other property was foreseeable or where the damaged other property was part of an integrated system compton reply at  compton mem at  in support of the foreseeability approach compton cites the eighth and sixth circuits for the rule that tort remedies are unavailable for property damage experienced by the owner where the damage was a foreseeable result of a defect at the time the parties contractually determined their respective exposure to risk regardless whether the damage was to the goods themselves or to other property dakota gasification co v pascoe bldg sys  fd   th cir see also detroit edison co v nabco inc  fd  th cir applying the economic loss doctrine because it was foreseeable to the parties to the contract that pipes conveying highpressure steam could explode and that such an explosion would damage equipment surrounding the pipes in support of the integrated system approach compton cites federal district court opinions for the rule that damage by a defective component of an integrated system to either the system as a whole or other system components is not damage to other property superior kitchen designs inc v valspar indus usa inc  fsuppd   dmass see also myrtle beach pipeline corp v emerson elec co  fsupp   dsc if the other property is merely a component part of the overall product itself  courts uniformly hold that the economic loss doctrine precludes recovery in tort against the manufacturer of the component because the component is integrated into the whole product and the purchaser bargained for the whole product not merely a component of it compton also cites as support the maryland court of special appeals opinion in pulte home corp v parex inc  mdapp   ad   mdct specapp affd  md   ad   in that case plaintiff contended that the allegedly defective synthetic stucco exterior barrier product in the walls of homes caused damage not just to itself but also to the substrate to which it was attached which consisted of sheathing and framing pulte  ad at  the court of special appeals upheld the trial courts rejection of plaintiffs argument agreeing that the barrier product was part of an integrated whole—a completed home—when the damage occurred and the damage was thus a harm to the product itself id at  i am not persuaded however that the maryland courts would apply the foreseeability or the integrated system approach to the instant case other than pulte compton has cited no case in which maryland has adopted either of these approaches further neither approach can be reconciled with the precise distinctions between the product and other property drawn by the maryland court of appeals in decoster and judge blake in national coach as for pulte the maryland court of special appeals reasonably concluded that in the sale of a new home the barrier product was part of an integrated whole with the sheathing and framing of the home  ad at  in contrast here comptons construction work on the van agtmaels already existing home was specifically limited to the roof and thus can be far more easily distinguished as the defective product from the other property in the house including the houses walls interior ceilings floors utilities and contents c compton also cites case law applying the economic loss doctrine in defective roofing scenarios in support of its position compton reply at  two of the cases compton cites are clearly distinguishable from the instant case first in jones  laughlin steel corp v johnsmanville sales corp  fd   d cir  the court held that under illinois law plaintiff steel mill could not recover in strict tort liability for a defective roof however unlike in the instant case plaintiff sought only economic loss damages for the failure of the product the defective roof to perform as it was expected as distinguished from injuries to persons or other property caused by a defect in the product id at  second in citizens insurance co v osmose wood preserving inc  michapp   nwd    the court held that the economic loss doctrine applied to preclude liability for damages to real and business property as a result of the collapse of a defective roof the court explained unlike some jurisdictions the economic loss doctrine applies in michigan even when the plaintiff is seeking to recover for property other than the product itself id at  because michigan law on this issue stands in direct contrast to maryland law it is of no help in determining whether the van agtmaels house was other property at first glance another case cited by compton chicago heights venture v dynamit nobel of america inc  fd   th cir provides support for its position there the seventh circuit held that under illinois law defendant was shielded from tort liability for damage to other parts of the building caused by the lack of adequate roofing relying on jones  laughlin the seventh circuit recognized that in that case the plaintiff did not seek damages for any injury to property other than the roof itself id however the seventh circuit believed that this distinctionthat the plaintiff in jones  laughlin requested only damages for injury to the product while the plaintiff in chicago heights venture requested damages for injury to the other propertywould not be considered legally significant to the illinois courts id to the contrary in united air lines inc v cei industries of illinois inc  illappd   illdec   ned   illappct the illinois appeals court expressly held such a distinction was legally dispositive the court held that under illinois law a warehouse owner could recover in tort for damage to a building caused by a defective roof because united suffered damages to property other than the defective product as a result of the water leakage defect in the roof which caused the sudden and violent collapse of its interior ceiling upon its walls furniture and furnishings united has thus made a showing of harm above and beyond disappointed expectations id for these reasons i am not persuaded that any of the case law compton cites provides guidance as to what is other property for purposes of the economic loss doctrine in defective roof scenarios under maryland law d in light of the maryland court of appeals decision in decoster and judge blakes decision in national coach i conclude that under maryland law the economic loss doctrine does not shield compton from tort liability for damages to the van agtmaels house and its contents with the exception of the roof itself compton was allegedly negligent in replacing the van agtmaels roof and thus is potentially responsible for all damage to other property resulting from that negligence including damage to the houses walls interior ceilings floors utilities and contents as i stated in my june   memorandum opinion a subcontractor performing work owes at least reasonable care and precautions    see pac indem co  fsuppd at  n  quoting klein v dougherty  md   ad    in klein the court held that defendant subcontractors were liable under tort law for smoke damage caused by their negligent installation of a furnace smoke pipe into a chimney because neither of the subcontractors exercised such care as a qualified person would ordinarily have exercised under the circumstances of this case klein  ad at  for this reason and the reasons above i conclude that if compton is found to have been negligent it is responsible in tort for damage to property other than the van agtmaels roof itself ii as to whaleys indemnification claim compton argues again that it should be dismissed because whaley committed active negligence and the plaintiffs complaint alleges active negligence with respect to whaley compton mem at  as i stated in my june  memorandum opinion neither of these contentions is accurate under maryland law if the conduct attributed to the party seeking indemnification in the original plaintiffs complaint constitutes active negligence or if it is clear from the complaint that this partys liability would only arise from proof of active negligence then there is no valid claim for indemnity kelly v fullwood foods inc  fsuppd   dmd pacific indemnity companys complaint alleges that the damage to the van agtmaels property was caused by the negligence    of defendant whaley   andor his subcontractors     compl ¶  the conduct attributed to whaley in the complaint does not constitute active negligence because the complaint specifically leaves open the possibility that compton was the actively negligent party accordingly whaleys liability could arise from proof of passive negligence further there is a genuine dispute on the summary judgment record as to whether whaley andor compton were negligent and if so whether their negligence was active or passive see pac indem co  fsuppd at  for these reasons i held and continue to hold that whaleys indemnification claim must survive summary judgment id for the foregoing reasons i deny comptons motion for reconsideration a separate order to that effect is being entered herewith order for the reasons stated in the accompanying memorandum opinion it is this th day of august  ordered compton  sons motion for reconsideration is denied footnotes  compton also requests that i reconsider my conclusion that compton owes a tort duty to the van agtmaels compton mem at  in my june   memorandum opinion i cited the following language for the maryland rule that contractual privity is not required to establish a tort duty the requirement of privity of contract has been abandoned as a basis for recovery by third parties for physical harm to themselves and tangible things against those who negligently supply repair or construct things so as to leave them in an unreasonably dangerous condition see pac indem co  fsuppd at  n  quoting council of coowners atlantis condo inc v whitingturner contracting co  md   ad    as compton correctly points out no unreasonably dangerous condition existed in the instant case however i had meant this citation only for purposes of making clear that contractual privity is not required to establish a tort duty i should have also cited the following language from the same case in following the modern trend we hold that privity is not an absolute prerequisite to the existence of a tort duty whitingturner  ad at  under maryland law whether a tort duty should be recognized in a particular context depends on two major considerations  the nature of the harm likely to result from a failure to exercise due care and  the relationship that exists between the parties jacques v first natl bank of md  md   ad    where the failure to exercise due care creates a risk of economic loss only courts have generally required contractual privity or its equivalent between the parties as a condition to the imposition of tort liability id at  as i discuss infra because i conclude that comptons alleged negligence created a risk of and ultimately resulted in property damage rather than purely economic loss i hold that compton owes a tort duty to the van agtmaels notwithstanding their lack of contractual privity  the maryland court of appeals has explained the rationale behind the economic loss doctrine as follows a manufacturer may be held liable under tort law for physical injuries including harm to property caused by defects in its products because it is charged with the responsibility to ensure that its products meet a standard of safety creating no unreasonable risk of harm lloyd v gen motors corp  md   ad    citation omitted emphasis added by contrast where the loss is purely economic the manufacturer cannot be charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the product meets the particular expectations of the consumer unless it is aware of those expectations and has agreed that the product will meet them thus generally the only recovery for a purely economic loss would be under a contract theory id emphasis added  for example in whitingturner a condominium owners association brought suit against a general contractor developer and architects of their building alleging that defendants had negligently constructed defective vertical utility shafts in the building  ad at  because defendants alleged negligence had not caused physical harm to any person or property the maryland court of appeals had to determine whether defendants had any tort duty to plaintiff based solely on the economic loss of reconstructing the utility shafts id at  recognizing that the economic loss doctrine would normally preclude tort liability the court carved out an exception from the doctrine concluding that notwithstanding the lack of personal injury or property damage where the risk generated by the negligent conduct  is of death or personal injury the action will lie for recovery of the reasonable cost of correcting the dangerous condition id at  because the court found that the construction defects in the utility shafts created a serious risk of injury to residents of the building it allowed recovery in tort to correct those defects since whitingturner the maryland court of appeals has in at least three other cases grappled with the issue of whether—although the alleged negligence of a defendant had not caused personal injury or property damage but rather only economic loss—the risk of injury resulting from the negligence was serious enough to warrant tort liability see us gypsum v mayor  city council of baltimore  md   ad    holding that the risk of death or injury caused by asbestoscontaining building materials was serious enough to warrant tort liability morris  ad at  holding that the risk of injury caused by defendants alleged negligence in manufacturing defective plywood used in building houses was serious enough to warrant tort liability lloyd  ad at  holding that the risk of bodily injury because of the alleged negligent manufacturing of defective automobile seats was not serious enough to warrant tort liability  in saratoga the supreme court held that under admiralty law plaintiff the second userowner of a fishing vessel could recover in tort from the manufacturer of the vessels allegedly defective hydraulic system for damages to extra equipment added to the ship by the first userowner of the vessel because the extra equipment was other property  us at   sct  the court stated state law often distinguishes between items added to or used in conjunction with a defective item purchased from a manufacturer or its distributors and  permits recovery for the former when physically harmed by a dangerously defective product thus the owner of a chicken farm for example recovered for chickens killed when the chicken house ventilation system failed suffocating the  chickens inside see decoster  ad at  id at   sct   i note that the third circuit rejected the foreseeability and integrated system approaches in j corp v tice  fd  d cir in that case a purchaser of a preengineered warehouse sued the warehouses manufacturer for negligence products liability and breach of contract alleging that the warehouse collapsed and damaged goods stored therein id at  the court addressed the issue of whether property becomes a part of the product itself solely because after the sale to the initial user it is foreseeably utilized in connection with the owners use of the product id at  the court held it seems apparent to us that if the fishing equipment foreseeably added to the ship by the initial user in saratoga fishing   us at   sct  did not become a part of the product itself it necessarily follows that the inventory foreseeably stored by the initial user in the warehouse here did not become a part of the warehouse itself accordingly we believe that the district courts integration theory in this case is inconsistent with saratoga fishing and that it follows a fortiori from the holding in saratoga fishing that j can recover for the loss of its inventory and other property stored in its warehouse id at   i recognize that the different decisions in chicago heights venture and united air lines were at least in part a result of the seventh circuits and the illinois appeals courts different interpretations of the illinois supreme courts holding in redarowicz v ohlendorf  illd   illdec   ned  ill while the seventh circuit understood redarowicz to preclude liability for damage to other property resulting from a latent construction defect chicago heights venture  fd at  the illinois appeals court understood redarowicz to preclude liability only for damage to the defective product itself united air lines  illdec   ned at  in any event the conflict between these two cases demonstrates that illinois law does not provide clear guidance on what is other property where a defective roof has caused damage  i recognize also that the maryland court of appeals noted in whitingturner that a contractors tort liability is in general limited to situations where the conduct of the builder causes an accident out of which physical harm occurs to some person or tangible thing other than the building itself that is under construction  ad at  emphasis added i do not believe however that the courts language has any bearing on what is other property in defective roof scenarios because as discussed supra plaintiff in whitingturner did not allege that there was any damage to property other than the product itself id further the court discussed the building as a whole because the defendants had negligently constructed defective vertical utility shafts in the entire building id at  in the instant case by contrast compton worked specifically only on the van agtmaels roof not their entire house comment your name your email
