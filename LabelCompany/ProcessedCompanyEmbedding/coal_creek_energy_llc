gas without the use of hydraulic fracture stimulation our natural gas and water flow through a coal seam and into the wellbore water is pumped up the tubing natural gas rises up the casing natural gas is sent to a compressor station and then sent down a pipeline to consumers water is released through permitted outfalls or sent down a pipeline to storage quick facts low emissions natural gas emissions are roughly half that of coal emissions when compared on an energy equivalence basis affordablefamilies who use natural gas appliances instead of electric appliances spend an average  less on cooking running dryers heating their homes and water heating reliablenatural gas is an abundant domestic resource that supplies nearly one quarter of the energy used in the united states zero hydraulic fracturingunique to carbon creek energy our natural gas is produced without the use of hydraulic fracture stimulation click the link below to read a recent article about carbon creek’s fracfree approach read the article natural gas exists in coal seams below the earth’s surface the chemical properties of coal and methane make methane cling or adsorb to the coal at the molecule’s surface the chemical structure of coal allows seven times more methane molecules to occupy coal compared to an equal volume of conventional reservoir rock coal seams have naturally occurring cracks which means that natural gas flows through coal with greater ease than conventional reservoir rock however it also means water can penetrate through the coal – and since water is heavier than gas – the water must be pumped out of the reservoir in order to produce the gas carbon creek produces coalbed natural gas by drilling a well and installing a pump to lift the water off the natural gas a portion of the water produced is released through permitted outfalls for livestock or wildlife to use the remainder of the water is sent down a pipeline to storage the natural gas is gathered by compressor stations and sent down a pipeline for sales the natural gas goes on to produce electricity fuel natural gas vehicles and heat people’s homes how clean is the water the water released in our outfalls is near epa drinking water quality standards and it meets criteria for livestock and wildlife watering in fact the water from our outfalls is cleaner than the receiving waters at all release points responsible water management carbon creek is committed to protecting our environment this is how we practice responsible water management the wdeq has set water quality standards and compliance requirements to protect the state’s water quality the wdeq has granted carbon creek permits to release water the permits outline the state’s standards and requirements carbon creek conducts water sampling and reporting in accordance with the permits issued by the wdeq the wdeq evaluates compliance and permits carbon creek to release the water so long as the state’s standards are upheld what is an outfalloutfalls allow carbon creek to recycle water in drilling operations provide drinking water to livestock through stock tanks irrigate the surrounding land through center pivots and create reservoirs by working with the wyoming department of environmental quality wdeq we’ve been permitted to construct outfalls these outfalls are the mechanism by which we create value with this water for livestock wildlife and agriculture producers  outfalls can be in the form of water tanks to provide drinking water to livestock  reservoir outfalls also provide water for growing crops at carbon creek

here would you purchase again  yes original review deborah r california i dont drink energy drinks often mostly because they dont typically taste great and i drink coffee already however i was impressed with guru i couldnt put my finger on the flavor at first but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste kind of like matcha the nose is citrusy and refreshing that said although i stayed perky after drinking it i would say its safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too and if youre dead tired it might not make much of a difference it only has caffeine from the tea so not at all the crack type of artificial energy drink like a monster or red bull which i think taste gross and are horrible for you would you purchase again  yes original review mark w california this brand really holds up to the competition it has great flavor and balance plus its better for you then any other energy drink i would definitely recommend this

buying one and it was really good i loved the flavor and it kept me energized for hours would you purchase again  yes original review dawn j california enjoyable  it was a very tasty and light flavored drink i usually do not drink energy drinks but this one was great i like the fact that it is organic and non gmo  gave me a little boost to get threw the day i would recomend guru energy drink to family and friends try it youll like it  would you purchase again  yes original review michael c california i really enjoyed this drink wasnt overly sweet the right balance of sweetness lite refreshing drink that i would add into my daily lineup would you purchase again  yes original review darlene g california i love this yogurt it is so good it was sweet and yummy i would eat it every

perfect for on the go i definitely enjoyed the taste it was smooth and refreshing which is a rarity in the energy drink market i love that its organic and actually gave me natural energy so i will be adding it to my shopping list to keep on hand would you purchase again  yes original review melissa e california it had a taste like nothing ive tasted before for being organic and im not a big health nut or would remotely grab anything off a shelf that said organic on it but it wasnt half bad id purchase again if i needed a pick me upper and health drink in one would you purchase again  yes

for this product but i did enjoy the product it gave me a good push of energy would you purchase again  yes original review brotin d california i was extremely pleased with the taste of this drink there was no bitterness unlike other artificially sweet drinks the plus point of this drink is that its organic low calorie and contains ingredients that are not harmful to the body the caffeine in this drink is derived from natural sources like green tea so i can have as many drinks i desire without feeling guilty i tried the lite version of the drink the only negative point for this product is the price costing around  per can is quite expensive would you purchase again  yes original review irene m california goodbye monster and red bull no need for starbucks this wonderful energy drink was not bitter or too sweet like other energy drinks can br would you purchase again  yes original review stacie j california i havent had an energy drink in years but i decided to try the guru lite version with no sugar i was not too bad i would buy it again when im feeling a bit sluggish would you purchase again  yes original review roselie z california wow organic energy drink i was surprised

honest and unbiased review would you purchase again  yes original review andrea e california when it comes to energy drinks i always prefer to have a more natural drink with the chemicals and fake

but this over nos would you purchase again  yes original review sarah t california it is a pretty good drink taste isnt bad the only complaint is that i had to go to a certain store that is not near me to use coupon would you purchase again  yes original review melody k california this was actually the first energy drink i ever tried i was a little skeptical at first but i thought it was delicious it was a lovely soda lots of carbonation no aftertaste kind of like a citrus apple cider with tea but there was a little too much sugar i pay attention to carb intake as i am type  diabetic and there was quite a bit of sugartoo much for my taste i dont even think it needed it but it was still yummy would you purchase again  yes original review la c california im not big on mainstream energy drinks so im happy that theres a more natural organic variation i probably wont drink a ton of them but i would probably try to convert people from drinking big brand energy drinks to drinking guru i was happy to find the product provided being sold at sprouts would you purchase again  no original review jasmine c california i really enjoyed drinking this energy drink i love how it has only  calories everyone should try this organic vegan and nongmo drink why isnt this the new thing  gatorade should not be the energy drink people chose i loved how it boosted me up when im trying to get

attempt to avoid i am one of these people that said guru energy is fairly cheap usdcan if you buy it here off amazon it comes in the redbull standard  floz cans and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case compare this to monster rockstar or any other brand with standard  floz cans the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape i think a particular good feature of guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup i appreciate a good quality soda particularly microbrew colas and they often exclusively contain cane sugar so in summary this energy drink is fairly cheap good buzz all natural and great for coding gaming or studying would you purchase again  yes original review sangeeta m california nice drink for a pickmeup  refreshing and pleasant tasting ideal replacement for a soda  the carbonation without all the sugar was perfectly satisfying zero guilt would you purchase again  no original review ashley b california the biggest question is does it work the answer to your question is yes i was busy all day long and had the best energy ive had in awhile it feels a lot better than using redbull im very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy i have no question about that but this energy felt like ive slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever so pretty much i felt really good the taste isnt the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it its a little herbaly but not bad just different would you purchase again  yes original review christine f california i love it its sweet kind of tastes like this other energy drink brand ive tried before it tastes very good and not nasty or smell like alcohol like others do sure would rebuy again totally recommend this brand would you purchase again  yes original review cindy w california im a big fan of energy drinks so i consider myself somewhat of an expert and i must say this perticular energy drinkguru was quite surprising so if you get a chance

good it was a good size as well would recommend and buy again for sure would you purchase again  yes original review milo s california coming from someone who at one point drank a decent amount of monster energy drinks i can say that the guru organic energy drink definitely makes me feel better after consumption you still get a decent kick of caffeine but there is less crap ie less gnarly processed ingredients in it i dont consume energy drinks often anymore but id grab one of these if they are available the next time i want one would you purchase again  yes original review sarah h california i really enjoyed this energy drink it kept me alert but not at all jittery so many energy drinks leave me shaky and jittery but this one did not a big bonus for me is that t does not have gross or unpronounceable ingredients in it it is organic and naturally sweetened with only  calories this is the lite version my store did not carry the original it has a pleasant taste not great but

pronounce everything on the nutrition label it gave me energy without the crash from high sugar energy drinks would you purchase again  yes original review angela g california i really enjoyed the organic energy drink by guru it was reminiscent of a slurpee with a slight aftertaste of cough syrup but the cough syrup taste was not overwhelming it gave me energy like a normal energy drink would

bull it had a fruity flavor which is a plus i liked how it was carbonated and that all the ingredients were organic and natural i tried the regular flavor which was a bit too sweet for me so the lite may have been a better choice nonetheless the original was still pretty good i do not know if i would recommend it since the sugar g is quite high for one serving but over other energy drinks i would it is probably the best tasting energy drink i have tried so far would you purchase again  no original review jasmine h california love guru i think it tastes great kinda like jelly beans or something

california excellent taste and a good source of energy if you dont care much about sugar content then dont get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too the can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like im not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic the product isnt priced the most competitively but maybe that is because

ingredients many other energy drinks have would you purchase again  yes original review valerie f california i dont usually buy traditional energy drinks because i prefer clean ingredients this guru energy drink is very clean its organic too and has very low calories i actually liked the taste a lot better than i thought i would but you can definitely taste the stevia its a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out i did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work id probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunchearly afternoon at work would you purchase again  yes original review courtney s california i really enjoyed the sustained healthy energy this drink provided other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin b like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary which causes an energy crash this one takes a more natural approach the result is a productive pep that does not make you feel or seem like youre on crack and it doesnt cause a sudden drop in energy either the energizing ingredients are green tea extract guarana seed and ginseng there is also echinacea which is great for the immune system at first i found the stevia to be overwhelming but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping i have a suspicion i would like the nonlite version a bit more but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia would you purchase again  yes original review laura w california this seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it it has no color and has a light refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste without being too much it has natural organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols erythritol etc which usually cause me problems i therefore felt a nice natural energy boost without any discomfort loved it would you purchase again  yes original review alison e california it was easy to drink and i really like that the ingredients are organic the flavor is good with a slight vitamin aftertaste it has comparable amounts of caffeine to other brands of energy drinks with nonnatural ingredients overall it tasted good and i would buy it again would you purchase again  yes original review sheila t kansas while i occasionally consume energy drinks i often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that i can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize i wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products and im also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste as such i was really interested in learning about and trying out guru organic energy which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine given that i avoid calories in drinks i chose the lite version to try and i was pleasantly surprised the flavor was different and although i wouldnt say it was delicious it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks ive tried i didnt feel a huge kick of energy but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and i did feel alert if not energetic overall i think the guru organic energy drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients although im not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks the next time i want one i will choose guru organic trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review ashley z california surprisingly good i wasnt expecting this drink to be lightly carbonatedit was a nice surprise flavor was good and it definitely gave noticeable energy i tried it before a workout in place of my preworkout drink i wouldnt replace my preworkout supplement it gave me a less focused energy but i would drink it if i needed a little pick me up throughout the day would you purchase again  yes original review phyllis c california i love the fruity fizzy taste and the amazing list of organic and natural ingredients best of all it doesnt give me the jitters like coffee would i could concentrate and get a lot of work done as im trying to eat clean and stay away from sugar an unsweetened version would be awesome as it is im pretty happy with guru energy drink would you purchase again  yes original review stephany c california i got the original guru and what i liked about this drink was that it didnt taste like a energy drink it was light and it didnt have that strong

bristol farms which is great thanks for the drink would you purchase again  yes original review tirza v california great taste and good energy level i did not feel jittery or have a crash afterwards

review felicia c california i loved the fresh crisp taste of the sparkling water blended with the organic ingredients of cane sugargrape juicecitric and apple acid along with the vital nutrients of organic green tea leafguarana seedechinacea flower and panax ginseng within this oz can of usda organic certified guru energy beverage the guru energy drink gave me a boost of energy without making me

very tasty and refreshing especially on a hot day unlike most stevia sweetened drinks the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste theres a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is onpoint i dont usually drink energy drinks but this one is an exception to the rule its organic low calorie nongmo and contains ingredients that i can actually trust another big bonus i noticed is that i did not experience a crash afterwards i read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturallyoccurring caffeine from green tea and guarana i dont know why you would drink any other energy drink than this definitely loading up on these again soon would you purchase again  yes original review rebecca h california this product is packed with good natural ingredients unlike most energy drinks out there and still packs the same amount of caffeine the flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks which i didnt mind i have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me however i did not have the same issues with this drink i really enjoyed it if there is one thing i could say about it is there wasnt any selection at the store i went to they had one flavor of the drink in one size the drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks i would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multipack with a small discount would you purchase again  yes original review debbie z california good taste and no jittery feeling i will definitely recommend this

the guru energy drink is a great tasting alternative to other energy drinks im primarily a red bull fan but i got to try the guru energy drink it tastes a bit better than red bull but the crashes are

california this has to be the best energy drink that i have ever tasted it is a light crisp tangy citrus flavor that doesnt have a large aftertaste and gives me enough energy in the morning on my slow days would you purchase again  yes original review sophia h california i dont usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and i get shaky but with half a can of this drink i didnt feel overcaffeinated i liked that it is low in calories and organic but that also limits where i can buy it in the future i dont usually shop at sprouts or whole foods so this would only be something i would get when i rarely make it into those stores would you purchase again  yes original review laura c california the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape would you purchase again  yes original review mary c california i tried the lite version and it has a nice fruity taste it tastes much better than other energy drinks on the market the price in the market is comparable to other brands would you purchase again  yes

you purchase again  yes original review zemyna r massachusetts this was a surprisingly pleasant beverage i dont usually like energy drinks every now and again i break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee but im not a big energy drink person i think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat this one surprisingly seemed to have neither of those it was fresh tasting if you can believe it and i found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it the one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink the energy it did supply however came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects and for that i am quite grateful i may not buy it often but next time i reach for an energy drink ill definitely reach for guru and i will not hesitate to suggest it to friends would you purchase again  yes original review joan c california i always love energy drinks
