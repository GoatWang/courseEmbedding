discuss the details of our exceptional start to  during the first quarter we continued to successfully execute on our key strategic imperatives and the results and progress we will highlight today reflect the strong operating momentum of our global commercial franchises and significant advancements made in the key areas of research and development importantly we achieved these results while both investing in our highpotential research portfolio and assertively managing our capital structure our first quarter performance and key market dynamics for our products strengthen our confidence that we will achieve at least the midpoint of our  eps and product sales guidance ranges that we provided in january to that end today we are raising the lower end of our  sales and eps ranges our excellent business momentum also presents us with the opportunity to provide further clarity on our  targets where we now expect top line growth of approximately  and eps growth of approximately  based on the midpoints of our adjusted  and  ranges peter will provide additional details on our updated  guidance and  targets and in addition to reviewing our excellent commercial performance jackie and scott will discuss the progress our global teams are making towards maximizing the potential of our marketed products and broadening the footprint of our therapeutic franchises with the positive results of the phase iiib psa trial evaluating otezla in biologicnaive patients with psoriatic arthritis we have entered a twoyear period when we expect to have the results from  phase iii clinical trials involving our commercial portfolio and several key latestage compounds these significant laterstage programs and several molecules in early and midstage development are expected to provide the platforms for our continued growth through the next decade under the leadership of rupert vessey and rob hershberg our thematic centers of excellence and our integrated collaborative research model continues to advance our portfolio of unique and potentially transformative earlystage molecules towards critical decision points since the start of this year we have already achieved important milestones relating to the development of three novel therapies we filed investigational new drug submissions for cc a cellmod for acute myeloid leukemia cc a bet inhibitor in development for solid tumors and in collaboration with our partner bluebird bio we have dosed the first patient with bb our bcma cart therapy for patients with multiple myeloma additionally based on the tremendous progress our partner juno has made with its cd cart therapy we exercised our option on the program providing yet another opportunity for us to build on and leverage our existing expertise and infrastructure to accelerate the development of a unique therapeutic approach in the promising field of immunooncology combining our expertise in immunology and inflammation protein homeostasis epigenetics and immunooncology with insights gained from our worldclass partners is rapidly increasing our understanding of the biology and drivers of cancer and immuneinflammatory diseases this research engine is enhancing our discovery capabilities and driving the identification of therapies that have the potential to disrupt and improve the treatment paradigms for significantly underserved patient populations our first quarter performance and important research clinical and regulatory achievements have us well positioned to deliver high growth in the near medium and long term thank you and im pleased to welcome peter to our call peter n kellogg  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you mark and good morning everyone as mark mentioned this has been an exceptional start to the year with strong volumedriven product sales growth of  driving bottom line growth of  we are delivering this industryleading performance while significantly increasing our rd investments as we lay the foundation for longterm growth our business momentum has us on track to achieve the upper half of our previously issued  adjusted earnings guidance accordingly we are now raising the bottom end of that range updating guidance to  to  per share later on the call i will discuss how we see this momentum continuing into  and right through to  first i would like to provide our thoughts on the outstanding q results q net product sales grew  to approximately  billion really strong growth and key contributions were made by revlimid pomalyst and otezla both jackie and scott will address the underlying demand dynamics and outlook for these products later on the call separately as i mentioned on the last earnings call the sequential performance from q to q is always impacted by several items revlimid and pomalyst were impacted in q by higher grosstonet adjustments related to early medicare donut hole and other aca payments in addition international revlimid sales were favorably impacted by the russian tender in q and abraxane sales were impacted by customer contract optimization that resulted in a buyin during q followed by a sellthrough in q not surprisingly these dynamics resulted in a  sequential decline to net product sales from q looking at our top line drivers of growth volume accounted for  of the  total percentage points of growth outstanding operational performance a modest contribution from price was partially offset by foreign exchange the strengthening us dollar drove a negative forex impact of approximately  million or a  negative impact to net product sales at the bottom line adjusted earnings per share grew  to  per share which includes a  impact from milestone payments made to collaboration partners for the advancement of our joint programs now you may recall that we did not have any milestone payments in q last year this performance exceeded our guidance range of  to  per share due to this strong operational performance us revlimid sales are ahead of expectations and otezla and pomalyst posted very solid yearonyear growth turning to the pl line items as you can see celgenes outstanding pl performance continued the adjusted operating margin improved  basis points to  we saw meaningful leverage from ga and also from the fact that we are now lapping strong sales and marketing investments that were in place a year ago and these investments last year supported the launches of revlimid in newlydiagnosed multiple myeloma the us otezla launch and global rollouts for abraxane and pomalystimnovid this year the increase in sga was primarily to support the rollout of otezla in the european community as we highlighted over the last few quarters we are making significant investments in advancing our next generation of growth drivers through the mid to latestage clinical trials year over year rd grew  due to increased clinical trial activity the receptos operations which were not part of our q financials last year and the  million of collaborationrelated milestone payments that i just mentioned earlier finally the tax rate increased from the prior period largely due to product and geographic mix the exceptional operational performance in q drove adjusted earnings per share operating income growth drove  per share of the  per share bottom line growth in total financial levers had a negative  impact primarily due to higher interest expense from the  billion bond offering last summer we ended the quarter with approximately  billion in cash and marketable securities as we mentioned on the last call given current market conditions and our longterm view on the value of the company we accelerated our fullyear plans and were forceful during q with the repurchase program acquiring  billion of shares we achieved this level of activity while preserving financial flexibility to continue making strategic investments that further build longterm shareholder value based on the strong start to the year we are updating our  guidance we now expect revlimid to achieve sales of  billion the high end of the previous range abraxane sales are expected to be in the  million to  billion range due to a highly competitive us market for lung and breast cancer therapy otezla and pomalyst are on track with solid trajectories for the year all of this gives us confidence to raise the lower end of the previous total net product sales range to  billion we expect rd to increase throughout the year based on clinical trial activity and new programs coming into the portfolio such as the recent optin on junos cd cart program based on these adjustments we are also raising the lower end of the adjusted earnings guidance to the new range of  to  per share as i mentioned earlier a great first quarter and an improved outlook for  and very importantly we anticipate that this strong operational momentum will carry forward our guidance for  equates to  top line growth and  bottom line growth we have spent some time assessing how this great  momentum will carry forward beyond our current guidance year into our target timeframe we are very pleased to say that despite the previously discussed forex impact of the strengthen in the us dollar and our ongoing substantial latestage rd investment we expect to sustain our top and bottom line performance into  and through to our  target goals this has been achieved as we significantly increased our rd latestage pipeline investment funding  phase iii trials and is based on current forex exchange rates our outlook for  now establishes a target of  growth top line completely in line with our  target cagr previously announced it is again worth noting that viewed on a constant currency basis this  top line outlook represents performance at the high end of our previous target range additionally we anticipate that the  bottom line growth rate will be improved in  to  which is approaching our  cagr previously announced in our prior targets and it represents an improvement over the increased  bottom line guidance range of course all these growth rates are based on the midpoints of our target ranges with these outstanding growth prospects the operational performance of celgene is expected to remain outstanding relative to the industry for the duration of our target timeframe now lets focus on the two target years specifically turning to  the primary driver in our expected commercial performance is revlimid which we now expect to achieve sales of approximately  billion a  billion increase from our prior target both pomalyst and otezla are on track and expected to achieve our previous targets these three drivers are partially offset by abraxane due to the previously mentioned competitive dynamic importantly our rd agenda remains very full in  programs such as ged ozanimod durvalumab and junos cd program are exciting highpotential assets that represent nextgeneration growth drivers for the company and they will all receive important rd latestage investment in  at the bottom line we now target  adjusted earnings per share of between  and  a share and expect a  increase from  based on the guidance midpoints in each year finally for modeling purposes we advise you to use a diluted share count of  million shares now this figure is in line with our prior target but higher than our  guidance beginning next year a change to the fasb accounting standards for sharebased payments eliminates the favorable adjustment that is currently provided in the treasury stock method for calculating the diluted share count this will increase our share count based solely on the new calculation methodology additionally increases in the celgene share price will also create an increase in the calculated share count to round out our longerterm targets we are on track to achieve our  targets of over  billion in product sales and over  in adjusted earnings per share as i mentioned these figures now reflect the current forex environment we are on track despite the weakened us dollar due to our operational strength we expect that our mix of products will be different as we now anticipate that the momentum and upside expected with revlimid pomalyst and otezla will be offset by our reduced abraxane outlook as you can see q financial performance was outstanding it supports a strong fullyear outlook and aligns with our targets for  and  a very strong position for celgene thank you i would now like to turn the call over to my colleague jackie jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director thank you peter good morning everyone our teams around the world produced excellent results during q our hematology franchise performance is particularly robust especially in multiple myeloma we have leading positions in many geographies across all lines of myeloma therapy and we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us our global launch of revlimid in newlydiagnosed myeloma continues and is a key driver of our growth trajectory pomalystimnovid remains a critical component of our portfolio and has a strong global position in relapsed refractory myeloma abraxanes growth outside the us remains solid as the product rises to a standardofcare position in multiple markets in pancreatic cancer in the us we continue to face significant competitive challenges as we compete with novel agents in terms of both breast and lung our clinical medical and regulatory teams delivered another strong quarter of execution on our development programs weve made progress across all therapeutic categories on our portfolio of trials including opting into junos cd program we look forward to the ongoing advancement of our programs including the first readout from our phase iii revlimid lymphoma program with top line results from remarc for diffuse large bcell lymphoma coming soon significant growth opportunities are ahead of us in multiple myeloma revlimid and pomalystimnovid are now backbone therapies within combination regimens across all lines of myeloma treatment triplet combinations and continuous treatment are driving and will continue to drive increases in duration we are gaining shares in newlydiagnosed myeloma across many geographies and will continue to build on our competitive position with label expansions for revlimid in the poststem cell transplant segment and for pomalystimnovid in renal impaired patients and over time for both products in combination regimens generally for multiple myeloma the pool of patients is growing around the world with the aging population and with new therapies expanding survival and thus prevalence and large areas of unmet medical need in myeloma remain we believe we have a strong portfolio of novel agents in development that position us very well to deliver new therapies to patients who are not yet cured of their disease and we will report on our progress with those programs as they advance even as those development plans evolve for new novel agents starting already now with recently approved and soon to come triplet regimens we see nice growth opportunities for imids and combination regimens including imids to continue to gain market share in the us eu and other geographies as well revlimid had a great quarter in q and we are extremely pleased with our  yearoveryear growth excluding negative foreign exchange in the us in multiple myeloma we continue to see strong growth in new rxs and total rxs positive momentum in duration and the ongoing adoption of the continuous treatment approach with revlimid our growth is mainly volumedriven and we expect this to continue for a long time to come this strong momentum stems from a series of positive events that put revlimid in an outstanding position as a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma we now see solid trends in the us with  to  months of experience demonstrating the impact of these events in the marketplace these same trends are taking hold outside the us as well as we achieve reimbursement for newlydiagnosed myeloma across europe and now in japan with approximately one year of data post the launch of newlydiagnosed myeloma in europe now in several countries across europe we feel highly confident in revlimids future growth trajectory as we continue its broad global expansion pomalystimnovids global growth remained stellar at  for the quarter on a yearoveryear basis and is robust across most major geographies one exception was france where net revenues for the quarter were negatively impacted in the amount of about  million due to a onetime adjustment to rebates globally growth is volumedriven from share gains and increasing duration of treatment pomalystimnovid now holds a leading position in thirdline and greater myeloma in all major markets where it is approved and reimbursed growth will continue to be strong in  and beyond as we will have our first full year of product sales in japan as duration trends continue to increase around the world and as we work to update our label for renal impairment data which will allow us to better address that patient segment in addition pomalystimnovid combination regimens are being studied with a variety of novel agents and additional future growth will come as those data and subsequent approvals become available abraxane continues to hold a solid position in the treatment of breast lung and pancreatic cancers within a highly competitive marketplace in the us overall demand for the product has been relatively stable in pancreatic cancer abraxane in combination with gemcitabine remains the standard of care with around  share of firstline patients in both breast and squamous lung us shares have been generally flat while shares are somewhat down in nonsquamous lung we are also seeing some downward impact on the number of breast cancer patients being treated with chemotherapy post the launch of palbociclib early last year outside the us abraxane growth is good as the product is moving to a standardofcare position for pancreatic cancer in the markets where it is reimbursed future catalysts for abraxane include data from the now fully enrolled apact adjuvant pancreas trial expected in  and data from immunooncology combination trials in lung expected in  and triplenegative breast expected in  our hematologyoncology franchise is off to a great start to the year with particularly strong trends in hematology as peter highlighted this momentum is causing us to now see revlimid coming in at the upper end of our revenue guidance range for  at around  billion with the strength we see across our hematology portfolio this year when we look ahead to next year we now expect a target range for  total hematology revenues of  billion to  billion and range of  billion to  billion for the combined hematologyoncology franchise including the net negative impact of foreign exchange our clinical programs are advancing with lymphoma in the lead and we look forward to sharing top line data with you soon from the remarc diffuse large bcell trial as we move into  we will have even more data coming from our lymphoma program as we will see the readout of the relevance in follicular lymphoma in the first half of the year and the augment trial in the second half moving to the longer term we have expanded the number of new compounds and indications in our mid to latestage hematology pipeline this progress gives us significant confidence in our ability to deliver on our  target of over  billion of hematologyoncology sales despite negative currency impacts we look forward to providing you with more updates on our clinical programs during upcoming medical meetings as asco american society of clinical oncology and eha european hematology association are upon us and we have excellent sets of abstract submissions for both congresses thank you and i will now turn the call over to scott scott andrew smith  presidentglobal inflammation  immunology thank you jackie and good morning q was a strong quarter for celgene ii and for otezla in q we saw revenues continue to grow throughout the quarter in the us and the eu leading indicators of demand remain strong in all geographies in which we have launched and in march we filed the jnda in japan we also significantly advanced the development pipeline for celgene ii by taking important steps forward in the ged and ozanimod programs as well as with many other early to midstage clinical programs global otezla net sales for q  were  million this represents a  yearonyear increase sales in q continued to increase despite normal trx market declines in the first quarter the majority of revenues remain from the us but we are also seeing encouraging metrics in the early launch countries in europe in  our focus in europe is not only on execution in the early launch countries but also on gaining optimal reimbursement decisions in the next wave of countries and more broadly expanding our footprint in the eu this should be a significant source of growth in  and beyond overall we are very pleased with the global execution of the otezla launch as we head into the second full year of commercialization this strong start in  will help enable us achieve our goal of  billion in sales in  now looking specifically at the us physician and consumer campaigns are driving increases in brand awareness patient requests and trial its important to note that otezla continues to lead all other therapies in newtobrand share with approximately  of both psoriasis and psa markets additionally otezla total market share in the large psoriasis market has surpassed enbrel and now stands at  of the total branded market in the slower evolving psa market otezla has already achieved  market share of the branded market also importantly earlier this month at the amcp academy of managed care pharmacy meeting data was presented that concluded otezla patients showed a similar persistence compared with a biologic cohort amongst adults with psoriasis in the united states we are continuing to execute and advance on a robust lifecycle plan for otezla as previously mentioned we filed for both psoriasis and psa in japan we also received data from psa a phase iii study in biologicnaive patients this was our fifth positive phase iii study for otezla in psa we expect a number of milestones in  in  including data from our oncedaily registration program as well as phase ii studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis phase iii data from the global behçets trial should be available in  we are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs including ged and ozanimod specifically looking at ged in q we completed enrollment in the endoscopic study cd in crohns disease as well as continuing to enroll the large pivotal phase iii crohns disease trial cd and a phase ii proofofconcept study in ulcerative colitis during q we saw significant data readouts for ozanimod including presentations of both the week ms data at actrims americas committee for treatment and research in multiple sclerosis and the touchstone uc phase ii data at ecco european crohns and colitis organization we also expect the touchstone data to be published in a major medical journal in the very near future q was a quarter of tremendous progress for celgene ii the execution of the otezla launch has put us in a position to have a blockbuster contributor to the celgene portfolio this year and beyond we also moved all major development programs ahead these programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through  and beyond we are very excited and optimistic about the future of otezla and the rest of the ii portfolio as we move deeper into  thank you for your attention id like to now turn the call back to mark mark j alles  chief executive officer  director thank you scott and thanks peter and jackie as youve heard from the team we had an outstanding first quarter and our global teams made great progress towards meeting or exceeding many of the aspirational goals and objectives we set at the beginning of this year we look forward to providing further updates regarding these milestones at key conferences and major medical meetings throughout the year our business momentum is accelerating driven by the robust value propositions of our major products and the beginning of a catalystrich twoyear period with data expected from  latestage clinical trials we are energized and focused on executing on our strategic imperatives maximizing our incredible potential and discovering developing and delivering transformational therapies to patients in need our outlook has never been stronger more dynamic or held as much promise as it does today operator please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of michael yee from rbc capital markets michael yee  rbc capital markets llc hey thanks congratulations mark its your first big earnings call as ceo on the  guidance i appreciate slide  which really implies that its all due to fx can you just help me connect the data points between revlimid going up by  billion but total net product sales going down by about  billion so that would imply changes not only to abraxane but otezla and possibly pom pomalyst which wasnt necessarily commented on can you walk us through what the thinking is around those other products and if the guidance youre thinking has changed on  thanks peter n kellogg  chief financial officer  executive vice president hi michael its peter let me start on that and then im going to pass it to jackie and scott as well just to comment on their outlooks for each of their related products so you referenced a slide that actually for the benefit of all the listeners is actually in the backup its the first slide i believe in the backup of the slides that we went through and it just simply highlights that over time weve had targets for  revenue which actually from when they were originally issued to more recently they were  billion to  billion which was an increase from the original target and if you eliminate the forex impact what it shows is that in fact our current operational performance is in the high end of that guidance range the entire discussion for  total product sales is entirely a question of the strong operational performance offset by foreign exchange impacts by a strengthened dollar so thanks for pointing that out i think the key is also though and very importantly is with the targets that weve laid out for  and for  we can see now our path forward at current foreign exchange rates to having very strong sales momentum that were achieving this year that we anticipate maintaining that momentum in  and quite frankly that sets us up very well to maintain that momentum all the way through  now in terms of the individual products maybe ill let jackie and scott each just comment on what they see happening jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director thanks michael so just on the hemeonc franchise weve talked about the mix for the franchise for probably about a year or so as being different than what we had expected back in  when we gave these targets largely driven by the dynamics for abraxane in the marketplace post the era of the checkpoint inhibitors and a couple of other novel agents as well so if you take the revlimid update of  billion compared to  billion before thats the plus  billion that you talked about when you think about the operational performance though the lions share of the foreign exchange would also hit revlimid that  billion excluding foreign exchange would be even higher significantly higher the other product that would come next in the ranking of those impacted by foreign exchange would be pomalystimnovid now that were into the year where we have more international sales for that product you will remember that the abraxane target for  that was given in  was  billion to  billion so now honing in on that abraxane number of around  billion you can see i think pretty clearly where that mix shift is scott andrew smith  presidentglobal inflammation  immunology this is scott on the otezla side were reaffirming the  target for otezla regardless of fx at  billion to  billion michael yee  rbc capital markets llc okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of robyn karnauskas from citi robyn karnauskas  citigroup global markets inc broker hi guys thanks for taking my question and the slides are great by the way for all of us here i just had a big picture question and a maintenance question the big picture question is i get a lot of questions from investors trying to understand what kind of changes to the revlimid dynamics are going to happen as we approach the cliff youve got a lot of new combos and data that are coming out this year im wondering if you thought about how you might articulate to investors how to think about either qualitatively or quantitatively what percentage of revlimid you might be able to offset with these new combos because modeling that in the out years really makes a difference and theres not a lot of color out there right now then the second question is a maintenance question for scott any changes in prior auth authorization requirements for otezla that youve seen in the last three months thanks jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director thanks robyn its jackie im going to jump in on the revlimid question and if any of my colleagues who want to add to it please feel free the main thing that we see as we continue to make progress on the top line is we feel like weve got pretty clear visibility to how we will be able to bring more targeted novel agents to market to further address certain patient segments within multiple myeloma be they highrisk patients patients that are refractory to certain compounds and we i think have a plan and a strategy thats as clear as its ever been with the agents that we have in our hands today and you saw that on one of the slides where we have quite a nice portfolio and what weve learned about the mechanism of action of the imids over time is also allowing us to potentially accelerate the next generation of compounds coming out of that platform and the cereblonmodifying agents to allow us to achieve that segmentation and then bringing in more targeted therapies to the different patient segments so when we think about revlimid as we approach that  –  timeframe we see it probably not being replaced by one new novel agent but by a basket of novel agents and combination therapies that are going to allow us to grow through that patent cliff and i think thats probably as much is i need to say at this point in time i would also maybe add that at some point when we do another research day or an analystinvestor day i think well be looking to give you a bit more visibility to how were thinking about those things let me also maybe just summarize before i turn it over to scott sorry for the longwinded answer but with the negotiation on the patent litigation i think from your perspective in modeling now that youve got that  goalpost in there you can see how we get there over the next  years in terms of bringing these novel agents forward and i think youll see that our development programs are taking us in that direction sorry im keeping – going long with this but there are some compounds that are also not in any of our forecasts yet including durvalumab for example which is one that youve got a decent amount of visibility to already in terms of the clinical development program and youll see data over time so with that im going to stop scott andrew smith  presidentglobal inflammation  immunology thank you for asking the question robyn i think to understand – to answer your question i think you have to look at the market dynamics and what you see for the market as a whole in q relative to q q q is this idea of patients reinsuring and rehaving to go through the prior auth process and so you definitely see for all compounds all products in the space that there is an increase in that prior auth process early in the year and then the patients work through it a number will have to redo it every year some will go continuously but what you see overall is a little bit of a chilling or a drop in q in the overall psoriatic marketplace and youve seen it for number of years in a row and then you see the increases happening in q q and q and we see that in the market this year so you do see an increase in the number of prior auth requirements for otezla but you see it for the whole market its a normal market phenomenon that we see in q robyn karnauskas  citigroup global markets inc broker what about step edit do you have to use enbrel ahead of otezla is that changing yet scott andrew smith  presidentglobal inflammation  immunology its a dynamic environment in terms of the payer environment over time we are increasing the number of patients who arent exposed to step edits one thing i will say is that the step edits that exist in plans are not necessarily mandatory step edits there are processes letters of medical necessity and other things that can happen to allow access for patients even on plans where there are step edits our guess right now is that  of patients who are being prescribed otezla are getting otezla regardless of the edits on the plan within a reasonable period of time so were continuing to evolve the landscape we want to make it better and better but the access position is relatively good for a launch product at this point in time robyn karnauskas  citigroup global markets inc broker great thanks so much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of geoffrey porges from leerink partners geoffrey c porges  leerink partners llc thanks very much for taking the question and congratulations on clarifying  peter i just wanted to if you can give us a little bit more color on the sequential grosstonet from q to q in the us for otezla rev revlimid and pomalyst you mentioned that and then secondly you talked in your presentation about the strong financial flexibility that you have a certain amount of leverage already on your balance sheet could you give us a sense of where you might be willing to go in terms of debt to ebitda or debt to total capital using your balance sheet from here that would be helpful thanks peter n kellogg  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure good morning geoff thanks for the question so the first thing on the sequential what you see each quarter at the beginning of each year in the first quarter i think this is actually not so much specific to celgene even necessarily its an industrywide phenomenon which is with the aca program you do make payments each of us has a certain tax we pay as well as we have to make higher grosstonet payments early in the year to fill the donut hole so i think thats a dynamic where you see a lot of that coming through and basically its a first quarter effect that hits the grosstonet thats the main item i dont think theres anything else beyond that and i do think probably if you found products that came into the same reimbursement world with the government programs under aca youd see that for most companies i went through that just to highlight as you go from q to q its just an odd thing if you happen to be looking at sequential quarters which personally i always like to look at yearoveryear growth obviously but if you look at sequential quarters these are the things to keep in the back of your mind that the grosstonet does pick up some extra volume in the first quarter also just to remind you in q we actually did have a very favorable tender that helped our performance in the first quarter its not so much of a grosstonet but its a good volume item and i mentioned that as well and then jackie in her comments we did have one adjustment into our grosstonet in france that actually impacted the grosstonet for pomalyst so pomalyst really i think is key to understand that there is a slight adjustment in the first quarter its a onetimer its a catchup so pomalyst i think you need to read through that a little bit to make sure you get an accurate view of the momentum of pomalyst which is just great and doing very well around the world on the second question relative to our flexibility i would just highlight a couple things first of all as we went to the transaction with receptos last year we did increase our debt load and obviously we highlighted that that took us up to a much higher debttoebitda ratio for the short term and with the very strong cash flow performance of the company that will be worked back down again pretty quickly actually weve obviously covered that with the credit agencies very carefully and full understanding and agreement on that which is great the other thing id say is that as we do our business development activity we are able to use some of our foreign cash in a lot of these transactions because very often we have restofworld rights so were actually buying ip that for example when we did the astrazeneca deal that ip was already offshore or as you get other transactions like ged likewise an offshore asset so we are able to use that and so as a result our us cash position relative to the moodys rating is not as stressed we were also able to do that with receptos so we have a relatively good us cash position we highlight that in the q youll see that in the q each quarter we did it for the k as well and in fact our us cash position is actually relatively good having gone through that transaction so from that standpoint we feel very good about our debt to ebitda we actually just recently met with all the agencies everything is good now your question was more prospectively if a transaction came along how would we look at it those are situation specific i think it was a large transaction – obviously were not trying to forecast that would be the case but obviously you might end up using some equity or you might push yourself up again a little bit but we obviously have got a very very full arsenal right now between our internal pipeline as well as our collaboration portfolio and so we really did use  as a major year to step into immunooncology are we still hungry for bd deals absolutely you see us continuing to do transactions with different companies often fitting in the profile of our collaboration portfolio so from time to time if the right opportunity came along we would be happy to step up and i think the point about strong financial flexibility is that we have been very fortunate to have a very strong cash flow in this company we work very closely with the credit agencies on a regular basis and we feel very comfortable about where we are and where were going geoffrey c porges  leerink partners llc great thanks very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of mark schoenebaum from evercore isi mark j schoenebaum  evercore isi hey everybody thanks for taking my question i really appreciate it congratulations to mark it seems everyone is breaking the rules so ill ask two questions too you can decline to answer one if you like but i think bob is in the room i know bob has been very involved i think in pharma and bio and a big topdown issue for the sector is drug pricing id love to hear bob you just talk about where you think thats going and how thats going to evolve either with your celgene hat on or with your pharmabio hat on if youre willing to and then a more operational question – not really operational a pipeline question can you just talk more about the remarc trial the primary endpoint i believe is pfs progressionfree survival and im assuming its not powered for os overall survival so is pfs enough a to gain regulatory approval in both the us and the rest of world and without os and b if it is approved do you think physicians will adopt this therapy without seeing and os benefit thank you very much jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director hi mark its jackie so i guess i get to choose which question we dont answer mark j schoenebaum  evercore isi yes thats fine you can answer both though jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director ill take the remarc one first and then turn it over to bob i think i can answer the remarc question pretty quickly i think weve talked about this before everybody knows the trial thats on is revlimid maintenance for patients that have responded to rchop its for two years it matches up very nicely with the unmet medical need in that space the trial is powered for both pfs and os what we would expect to see – i think weve even told you and you can see out there in clinicaltrialsgov that the expected pfs difference would be about  months versus the control and we would expect or hope to see a positive statistically significant result on pfs and a trend on os we do not necessarily expect at this time to see a statistically significant trend so we think that with the trend in os and a positive pfs trial that weve got a nice regulatory submission mark j schoenebaum  evercore isi thanks jackie robert j hugin  executive chairman and then mark on the pricing and the environment that we face i think there are important issues that we need to make sure were all aware of we have the overarching economics of the demographics of the developed societies that are going to keep pressure on healthcare economics for several decades and so i think the most significant issue that we all face is how do we afford the healthcare that we want to have and make the investments in the future that we want and i think that were very concerned by the level of noise in the environment its very concerning and its real and also to put it in perspective every eight years we have a presidential election when thats definitely going to turn over you see this happening whether you look at  or  and what happens and so it is an important time for us to address these issues so first were going to be faced with these issues of cost and value for a long time regardless of the politics of it the politics are important to us i think we need to make sure we understand that the kind of changes that anybody would propose to really affect our outcomes are going to be very significant are unlikely to occur so we think the issues are going to have to be dealt with through the normal operations of our businesses and the systems in our ecosystem whether its payers and providers and weve got to work to do a better job to define what value is and i think youre seeing people on one side of the system trying to decide this is the way well define value and others are going to other methods i think there are many collaborative efforts going on today between companies on our side and also versus payers working together to find solutions to these issues to ensure that we do constrain cost but not at the reduction of these kind of investments that we need to deal with the incredible issues that we as a society face from alzheimers cancer metabolic disease et cetera so were very concerned about it before the end of this presidential debate weve got to change the tenor to it to ensure that theres a balance to the discussion weve got important initiatives coming on from the industry about that in the coming weeks and months but i think we all have to recognize this is a longterm issue that were going to be dealing with based on the longerterm healthcare economics of the entire system and were going to have to  be prepared for that discussion mark j alles  chief executive officer  director i think bob just to wrap the point up and well go on to the next question mark you know celgene has been engaged in this discussion for a long time its not new for us as bob said this is a very longterm issue and were totally engaged worldwide weve built core capabilities across the globe in our franchises and in our global functions so its a thoughtful engaged approach and so for us this idea of patient access sustaining innovation i think the narrative thats in the media is different than whats actually happening between governments innovator companies like celgene and the patient groups that we deal with all the time so i think well see the tide change a little bit after the election but were totally engaged its constructive and i think for the long term we understand what our value proposition is as a company and what we have to do in research to continue to bend the curve in the future so maybe well go to the next question patrick mark j schoenebaum  evercore isi thanks mark operator thank you our next question comes from the line of cory kasimov from jpmorgan cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning guys thanks for taking the question i wanted to follow up on revlimid and the implications of the  guidance im really curious about the actual drivers behind the sizable bump to your updated rev outlook for  and how much recent positive data sets like the swog s study are driving this because if they are im curious if theres any particular reason why  stays the same for now in terms of that outlook thanks jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director maybe the short answer to your question on  is conservativism the trends are – thats one reason why we put the slide in there where we show some of those events that have occurred over the last  to  months that support revlimids position as a backbone therapy and the dynamics around its performance in the marketplace and now we just had the swog data presentation at ash american society of hematology last year but with that what were seeing and this is true across the world i think we also included the slides for the early launch countries for newlydiagnosed in europe where we now have about a years worth of data we see very strong share uptake in the markets where the product is reimbursed and were seeing positive duration trends in all geographies were also seeing physicians who previously did not necessarily fully embrace the continuous treatment paradigm now embracing that paradigm were also seeing fundamental support for not only revlimid but also pomalyst in combination that is going to be a reality for a long time to come were seeing very nice increases in duration for pomalyst as well so i think that were in a great position when you run some of the numbers out and do some scenarios we could have some nice upside to  i think today what we are prepared to say about that is we would expect the mix to be different between heme and onc as we have said for  and  but the fundamentals for revlimid and pomalyst both are really exceptionally strong mark j alles  chief executive officer  director i would just add jackie if i could recall that obviously we have never changed our view of  in fact despite the fact that the dollar has strengthened the operational strength the power of revlimid and pomalyst and otezla and our outlook for that have driven right through that foreign exchange impact so thats a little bit of the dynamic so we feel very good about the operational performance of these drugs more data coming through thats been great so in no way cory do we want you to think that were not very bullish on these leading brands peter n kellogg  chief financial officer  executive vice president i think some of those updates will come as we get more visibility into the market but i think the other thing that weve already talked about today is we have a robust pipeline of myeloma drugs behind all of this that we still need to see when and how they segment and change the market so a lot of dynacism a lot of opportunity and i think jackie said it well theres probably conservatism in the outlook simply because there are so many dynamic levers so thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ian somaiya from bmo capital markets m ian somaiya  bmo capital markets united states thanks for taking my question i was excited to see cc and cc mentioned as part of your line extension strategy for myeloma i was hoping you could speak to maybe the aspect of the revlimid profile these two drugs could potentially improve upon and i know there are at this point at least no clinical trials in myeloma maybe if you could speak to the regulatory timelines and clinical timelines and what the strategy will be is there potential for in the future running headtohead trials versus revlimid jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director yes so ian as i spoke about with respect to the patients and the segmentation strategy and how we see this playing out over the next few years we do think there is the potential to run headtohead trials in certain patient segments we think that what we have learned about effects immune effects with these different compounds and the mix of immune effects versus antitumor effects is something that is informing how we view these molecules you saw us add them to the pipeline for myeloma relatively recently so i think that should tell you something about the insights that we have its not only myeloma were also learning things that would inform how we think about the future for nhl nonhodgkins lymphoma novel agents and cll chronic lymphocytic leukemia novel agents and still unmet medical need patient segments in those categories too so i think one of the key aspects of this – there are probably two maybe and again those are the kinds of things that we would be able to address in a research type of day are the molecules behave very differently we know a lot about them now and are able to design them to finetune certain aspects of them to target certain patient segments were optimistic about that and the second thing would be based on what we know about this class of drugs is our ability once we see some proofofconcept data to jump faster to pivotal trials and accelerate the approval timelines for the drugs m ian somaiya  bmo capital markets united states what would those timelines be jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director we think that we have a good way to move forward with the portfolio of development programs for multiple novel agents and differentiated combinations that will allow us to bring those therapies to market for the  timeframe for the revlimid patent patrick e flanigan iii  corporate vice president investor relations i want to be sensitive to all the other earnings calls that are going to happen today so maybe karen if we have time for just two more callers operator certainly our next question comes from the line of ying huang from bank of america merrill lynch ying huang  bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning thanks for taking my questions first one is maybe for scott i guess you just reaffirmed the  guidance for otezla of  billion to  billion were probably running at  billion or so in  levels so what gives you the confidence that you will be able to meet that goal and also do you see any impact at all from the newly launched for example cosentyx from novartis and then second question i want to ask to maybe jackie are you seeing pressure in terms of competitive pressure from the newly launched drugs for example darzalex in the thirdline setting in myeloma and if so whats your vision going into the next couple years for pomalyst in that setting thanks scott andrew smith  presidentglobal inflammation  immunology thank you relative to otezla and the confidence we have on the targets or our goals for  and  are the idea that the trxs continue to grow were at the highest levels ever as of last week were seeing patient initiations at the highest levels possible were continuing to gain market share theres a lot of momentum on demand and were seeing very good persistency of patients on the drug there was a paper just published last week showing very similar persistency otezla versus a biologic cohort which is very encouraging and then weve got a number of countries that are going to be launching as we go through  into early  we are still at this point in reimbursement discussions and not launched yet in the uk and france and spain and italy so those are upside and growth drivers for late  –  and beyond and japan we believe is going to be a strong growth driver as well we filed in japan we had a very strong pivotal trial in psor we filed in japan we expect an approval towards the end of this year and be launching with reimbursement early in  we think theres a tremendous opportunity for the compound in japan theyre very oraloriented and very safetyoriented and we think the product fits very very well in there so we have a nice growth opportunity in japan the second part of the question was cosentyx what weve seen since the launch of cosentyx and if you look at the slides you can see the market share graphs both from a newtobrand patient initiation perspective and from a market share perspective and a trx perspective weve seen otezla continue to grow at a similar rate before versus after the launch of cosentyx we believe that they are products which are competing in quite different parts of the market cosentyx mainly from the tnf failure portion and if you remember some of the data that we presented on otezla  of patients who are coming to otezla are coming from something other than a biologic therapy whether thats lide lidocaine or topicals or oral dmards so i think theyre products that are in very different parts of the market and looking at different patient segments jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director hi ying so just on the dara daratumumab question what were seeing in the us is that its mostly staying in the fourthline and greater setting in terms of usage we are seeing some combination usage this is actually a positive thing for pomalyst were seeing increasing usage of pom in second and third lines its moving up i would say the dynamic is actually quite good in terms of the overall relapsed refractory market and we think as the combination data continues to emerge this is going to be quite positive for pomalyst on a goforward basis the other thing as i mentioned in my comments is were seeing nice increases in duration of treatment for pomalyst and were seeing them quarter after quarter were still seeing doubledigit growth in both new rxs and almost double the new rx level of growth in total rxs for pom in the us so its quite positive when you think about the environment outside the us the one thing i would say is keep your eyes on reimbursement discussions as novel agents come to market and keep in mind that pomalyst has an overall survival benefit in its label and thats quite important when you think about reimbursement positioning ying huang  bank of america merrill lynch thank you operator thank you and our final question for today comes from the line of eric schmidt from cowen  company eric schmidt  cowen  co llc thanks just two real quick ones for scott can you tell us what percent of a price increase you might actually capture on otezla i see there were a couple increases earlier in the year and then for peter the other income line is running well below the guidance you gave us last fall should we rethink that guidance scott andrew smith  presidentglobal inflammation  immunology thank you eric for the question we have had a couple of price increases if you take a look at the value proposition that we created for otezla at launch and that was to be at a significant discount to average biologic price when we launched we were at about a  discount to average biologic price now even though weve had a couple price increases weve lost a little bit of ground to the market and were at a  decrease or beneath our market competitors and where theyre at so the market has been aggressive on price weve been a little bit less aggressive than the market over the past couple of years we want to maintain that position at a discount to biologic price because we think not only in the us but around the world it gives us the best opportunity to penetrate and to be used early and the encouragement for patients to be used in the prebiologic space so were going to continue with that pricing strategy peter n kellogg  chief financial officer  executive vice president eric this is peter just on the oie line really quickly if you look at just interest expense and interest income were right on track with the guidance we gave but then always theres this other category where theres a lot of other things that come in it tends to be a little bit noisy you have some impairments some gains on some of our equity holdings and so forth and that nets out to be this quarter a little bit positive but quite frankly some of the gains were discrete items that pushed our tax rate up a little bit so overall in the financial section id say really not much benefit there and then overall the net positive probably we had a couple of positive items on our hedging relative to the recognition of positive impacts from the forward points as we roll forward you may recall last fall we had a couple of quarters where we had some negative impact this is just a volatile item that bounces back and forth so netnet though i think i would retain my comment that the interest expenseinterest income netnet should be in that high  million range on a fullyear basis in any given quarter the other category can be positive or negative and i wouldnt go one way or the other with that and i would remind you that sometimes when theres a positive it is offset by a higher discrete item on the tax line peter n kellogg  chief financial officer  executive vice president so just to wrap things up if i can just finish things up for the company were really thrilled with the first quarter we feel like we have come into the year with great momentum and its allowed us to increase our guidance top line and bottom line we have allowed that momentum to help us think through exactly where were going with our financial targets out in the outer years for  and  we feel really good about that i think as jackie and scott and mark all talked about we have got a lot of exciting activity going on in the pipeline and a lot of latestage reportout coming in the near term so i think if you go through the balance of  and into  we have a lot of very positive stimulus items reporting out and well see how that goes but boy were excited to

morning and thank you everyone for joining us id like to begin by welcoming michael pehl to our call in his role as president of our global hematology  oncology franchise michael brings over  years of industry experience to his leadership position and joined celgene in  as the first general manager of our german affiliate michael has made significant contributions to our company in roles of increasing responsibility including head of our hematology business in europe and head of our global hematology  oncology marketing group welcome michael we appreciate the opportunity to review our second quarter operating performance and the progress we have made advancing major corporate objectives with you guided by our strategic imperatives our global teams are driving outstanding results and achieving key financial regulatory clinical and commercial milestones that peter michael scott and jackie will discuss with you today against virtually every metric our second quarter was outstanding this momentum combined with the leverage our business model continues to generate improves our fullyear outlook such that today we are raising our  adjusted eps guidance to a range of  to  from our earlier target of  to  and are guiding to the high end of our current net product sales range of  billion to  billion peter will provide much more detail about our second quarter financial performance and improving outlook in a few minutes our management team is committed to delivering exceptional results each quarter while we continue to invest in and advance opportunities expected to maximize the potential of our commercial franchises and build strong and diverse platforms for longterm value creation we believe this balance was wellrepresented in the quarter for example at asco and at eha new clinical data were presented that cemented revlimids position as a standard of care for myeloma patients in just the past year five novel agents have generated significantly better clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma when combined with revlimid these new data and realworld patient outcomes are adding to the momentum of our global myeloma franchise as you will hear from scott our investments in the commercialization of otezla continue to drive it to leadership positions in the us psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis markets and its global expansion is accelerating as we complete launch preparations in major european markets and japan recognizing the inherent challenges associated with clinical development we continue to advance highpotential pipeline programs to diversify our opportunities earlier this week we announced that based on the interim overall survival analysis of the remarc study testing revlimid as maintenance therapy for patients with diffuse large bcell lymphoma we currently do not plan to seek approval for this indication however given the optionality and diversity of our latestage programs we remain confident in our mid and longterm growth potential and profile one of these programs is ged where later this quarter we expect to have the cd week endoscopic data scott will discuss our progress developing ged and our ii pipeline later during our call through our internal research capabilities and with our exceptional partners we have created and continue to add new platforms expected to improve our opportunities for longerterm growth since the beginning of the year we have filed four investigational new drug applications for celgenedeveloped products entered into a number of important collaborations and advanced key clinical programs with our partners last week we announced a new collaboration with jounce therapeutics adding to our differentiated opportunities to identify and develop novel immunooncology therapies our work with jounce is expected to meaningfully add to the progress we are making with our immunooncology partners juno bluebird bio lycera and astrazeneca and our expanded relationship with agios will investigate potential new therapies based on immune cell metabolic pathways that are expected have applications for the treatment of cancers as well as inflammatory disorders these examples highlight just some of the progress we are making with our efforts to discover and advance tomorrows transformational therapies and create a better future for patients in need we look forward to updating you on the progress of our research and key latestage programs throughout the second half of the year despite continued global economic and political uncertainties our business momentum has never been stronger we continue to invest in latestage clinical trials to optimize the value proposition of our existing portfolio advance our mid and latestage pipeline and add promising alliances to our internal research efforts these are very exciting times at celgene thank you very much and please help me welcome peter to our call peter n kellogg  executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you mark and good morning everyone in q we continued to build on the momentum from the first quarter and execute across our portfolio our strong top line growth is driven by volume with exceptional performance from our core products our bottom line is driven by careful pl management while we continue to invest in our innovative rd portfolio our performance this year has led us to raise our adjusted diluted eps range as mark said to  to  to guide net product sales to approximately  billion and revlimid sales to approximately  billion for  turning to our second quarter top line results we continue to see impressive industryleading growth our yearoveryear growth for net product sales was  now michael and scott will discuss the underlying demand for this performance later in the call the driver of our top line growth continues to be volume volume accounted for  of the total  percentage points our bottom line growth continues to be strong and adjusted earnings per share grew to  per share our yearoveryear  growth was achieved despite higher rd expenses related to our numerous latestage programs our acquisitions of receptos and quanticel that closed in the second half of  and the decision to opt in on several collaboration programs over the past year turning to our pl we continue to have exceptional performance the adjusted operating margin improved  basis points year over year to  for the quarter quarter over quarter we saw a  basis point improvement we continue to see excellent leverage in sga which from a margin perspective offsets our rd investment operating income drove  per share of the  per share bottom line growth financial levers had a total negative  impact which includes the additional interest expense from last years bond offering we ended the quarter with approximately  billion in cash and marketable securities for the first half of  we purchased nearly  billion of our outstanding shares and in june an additional  billion for share repurchases was authorized leaving us with a total authorization level of approximately  billion based on our exceptional first half performance and strong momentum we are updating our  guidance for revlimid net product sales total net product sales adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps now our prior guidance for pomalyst abraxane and otezla net product sales will remain unchanged as mentioned earlier we are guiding to fullyear revlimid net product sales of  billion from the prior guidance of  billion and this is due to the strong uptake seen year to date our continued management of the sga line allows us to raise our adjusted operating margin guidance for the year by  basis points to approximately  we now expect our adjusted diluted eps to be in the range of  to  we are also updating our diluted share count from  million to  million due to our first half share repurchases our first half performance has been superb and we anticipate continued great commercial momentum looking ahead we are also excited for the next phase of drivers to extend our future growth thank you and now id like to turn the call over to my colleague michael michael pehl  president global hematology and oncology thank you peter and good morning everyone before we start let me take the opportunity to thank our hematology and oncology teams across the globe for their great work in delivering a truly outstanding second quarter we have made significant progress in further maximizing the opportunity of our existing assets and in advancing our development programs and pipelines across assets and diseases our q financial results are extremely strong with  yearoveryear revenue growth and  sequential growth the revlimid ndmm launch is highly successful across all geographies we expanded reimbursement across key markets and saw positive uptake in duration trends in the markets where we have reimbursement pomalystimnovid continues to grow globally with strong market share and duration results abraxane had a positive quarter around the globe despite the uptake of novel agents in breast and lung cancer we are maintaining our us leadership position in pancreatic cancer and our pancreatic market share is growing in reimbursed markets outside of the us there was a very positive flow of data supporting our key inline brands impressive clinical results of revlimid in ndmm maintenance in combination with daratumumab in relapsedrefractory myeloma as well as abraxane combination data with checkpoint inhibitors have been presented at the asco and eha meetings in june our pipeline is advancing substantially including our ag and luspatercept pivotal studies we are very pleased with the progress of our io programs we have opened additional trials of the fusion program for the  and hematologic malignancies and made progress with our cart partnerships with juno and bluebird bio finally our nextgeneration celmods are moving forward in the clinic revlimid delivered outstanding results in q with  year over year and  sequential revenue growth all key performance metrics are strong globally and the majority of the growth is coming from volume the us ndmm launch continues to produce significant share and duration gains us yearoveryear growth in trxes for the quarter was  and nrx growth was  we have made steady progress with reimbursement in europe and expect to have reimbursement in additional markets such as italy by the end of  ndmm share continues to grow in reimbursed markets in europe as well as in japan and is in line with our expectations as we discussed during our q earnings call the momentum for revlimid in multiple myeloma is extremely strong supported by multiple drivers such as the ongoing ndmm launch the growing evidence for continuous treatment and multiple triplet readouts and approvals in the us and in europe additional momentum in myeloma beyond  will be generated through our ongoing and planned sct maintenance submissions in europe and the us as well as the recent publication of rd plus daratumumab data in relapsedrefractory myeloma with an estimated progressionfree survival of well over  months as we look forward for revlimid beyond myeloma lymphoma will be a major growth driver by  and beyond as mark mentioned earlier this week we provided an update on the remarc trial evaluating revlimid as maintenance therapy in patients with diffuse large bcell lymphoma responding to firstline rchop therapy we are working closely with our partner lysa to analyze the data and look forward to presenting the results at a major hematology conference later this year the remarc study is part of a broad revlimid program focused on multiple nhl histologies and patient segments while remarc evaluated a unique clinical strategy of using revlimid as maintenance monotherapy in diffuse large bcell lymphoma the other four phase iii studies are testing the combination of revlimid with rituximab or rituximabbased combination therapies in follicular lymphoma and firstline diffuse large bcell lymphoma patients with the abc subtype we feel that the evidence created through multiple phase ii studies in those settings is very robust supporting strong value propositions unique mechanisms of action and a good likelihood of success for the relevance robust and augment trials results from the relevance and augment trials are expected next year our  revlimid financial target includes between  billion to  billion in sales for lymphoma we designed this range to be independent of the success of any one of the five phase iii trials pomalystimnovid delivered a strong  yearoveryear and  quarteroverquarter net sales growth we have leading market shares in the us launch markets in europe and japan continue to see share gains while duration is increasing globally despite the growing number of relapsedrefractory myeloma treatment options we see a stable thirdline share and an increasing secondline share for pomalyst which is driven by earlier usage directly after revlimid and in combination with traditional and new agents further enhancing value proposition and clinical benefits we recently received fda approval for a pomalyst label update in patients with renal impairment which will allow us to better educate on the usage of pomalyst in this patient population we have received a positive chmp opinion for a similar label update for imnovid in europe our development programs for pomalystimnovid in multiple combinations continue to advance this includes our phase iii mm trial in combination with bortezomib in second or later treatment lines as well as ongoing phase iii combination studies with daratumumab and durvalumab abraxane had a solid performance in the second quarter with  yearoveryear net sales growth and  sequential growth in the us abraxane maintained its leadership share position in metastatic pancreatic cancer and continued to stabilize in breast and lung cancer despite competition from other agents abraxane net sales outside the us grew  year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and despite some slight headwinds from price and distributor buying patterns its important to note that many recently reimbursed markets have not yet reached peak shares in pancreatic cancer id also like to remind you of the longterm opportunities for abraxane data for abraxane in combination with tecentriq in triplenegative breast cancer were presented at asco adding to the highly encouraging clinical evidence for io abraxane combinations reported a couple of months ago for nonsmall cell lung cancer io abraxane phase iii trials in nonsmall cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer are set to read out in  and  respectively in addition to the development programs that i have described for our inline brands i am very pleased with the progress we are making in advancing our broad and deep earlier and laterstage pipeline let me focus on a couple of key programs and assets the enrollment of the phase ii expansion study of ag in relapsedrefractory aml is completed and the phase iii study in relapsedrefractory aml is on track our luspatercept collaboration with acceleron is rapidly moving forward and our expected phase iii trials in patients with lowerrisk mds and betathalassemia continue to enroll well im particularly excited about the progress weve made with our io pipeline the durvalumab fusion program is now enrolling six trials in multiple hematological malignancies in combination with many celgene assets including pomalyst in relapsedrefractory myeloma revlimid in newly diagnosed myeloma daratumumab in relapsedrefractory myeloma multiple assets in nhl or cll with vidaza in highrisk mds and aml and with cc in highrisk mds in april we opted into the cd cart program with juno and made good progress with our respective development programs for europe in the first quarter of this year we opted into a bluebird bcma program this program continues to advance and in conjunction with durvalumab and our next generation celmod will be an important cornerstone on our way to the cure for multiple myeloma finally id like to highlight the progress weve made in substantially advancing our understanding of protein homeostasis over the past few years which has put us in a position to investigate multiple new and potentially more effective nextgeneration celmods in targeted higherrisk patient segments we have our cc program enrolling into multiple proofofconcept studies in several indications both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents and we have other candidates coming that we will tell you more about as we make progress to summarize we had a great second quarter for the hematology  oncology franchise on all fronts as peter mentioned our strong momentum has given us the confidence to raise our revlimid revenue guidance to approximately  billion the strength of the entire portfolio makes us believe that we will hit the high end of our revenue range for  our clinical programs are advancing nicely the relevance and augment follicular lymphoma trials will read out in  the pomalystimnovid mm pivotal study will provide results in  and we have abraxane opportunities in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and with io combinations that will be reading out in  and  finally our earlier pipeline is moving forward substantially especially in io and protein homeostasis we have a lot of confidence in accelerating momentum in our nearterm and longterm opportunities and are on track to deliver on the  target for our franchise thank you and i will now turn the call over to scott scott a smith  president global inflammation and immunology thanks michael good morning q was a strong quarter for celgene ii in q we saw revenue growth accelerate throughout the quarter in both the us and the eu leading indicators of demand remained strong in the us and throughout europe in q we received the top line results for our atopic dermatitis phase ii proof of concept study and are evaluating next steps we also advanced the development pipeline by taking important steps forward in the ged and ozanimod programs as well as with other early to midstage clinical programs global otezla net sales for q  were  million this represents a  yearonyear increase and a  quarteronquarter increase the majority of revenues continue to be derived from the us but we are seeing strong metrics in the launch countries in europe we are pleased with the emerging access footprint for otezla globally we have now achieved favorable reimbursement decisions in  countries in europe and expect to conclude discussions in most of the remaining countries in q this progress in europe together with an expected approval in japan by the end of this year should represent a significant source of revenue growth for otezla in  and beyond now looking specifically at the us physician campaigns and a refreshed consumer campaign are driving increases in brand awareness patient requests and trialings persistence on otezla continues to lengthen as equivalent to biologic therapy at one year otezla also continues to lead all other branded therapies in newtobrand share the psa and psoriasis markets have grown significantly over the past few years driven in part by new launches of products with novel nontnf moas if we look specifically at these more recent launches we can clearly see from the graph that otezla has not only been a leader in growing the market but has also captured a strong and growing trx leadership position we are aggressively advancing the ozanimod development program as discussed previously the ms pivotal trials are fully enrolled and the ulcerative colitis pivotal phase iii trial true north is enrolling patients worldwide during q we saw significant data readouts for ozanimod including presentation of the phase ii touchstone histologic data at the ddw meeting in may and importantly the publication of the full touchstone phase ii data in the new england journal of medicine in q we also completed enrollment of cd the endoscopic trial for ged we expect to get initial top line data for the week portion of this study in q we intend to make these data available in the second half of  at a major medical meeting as a reminder the objective of the week portion of this study is to evaluate clinical response clinical remission and endoscopic improvements at an early time point this trial targeted to enroll a patient population with advanced or serious disease confirmed by both cdai and endoscopy at baseline this is a multinational site study with approximately  of patients in the world coming from north america the large phase iii pivotal trial cd continues to enroll and we have over  sites around the world now active additionally the phase ii proofofconcept trial of ged in uc is now fully enrolled q was a quarter of tremendous progress for celgene ii the execution of the otezla launch has put it in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the celgene portfolio this year and beyond we also moved all major development programs ahead through important milestones these programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through  and beyond we are very excited and optimistic about the future of otezla and the rest of the ii portfolio as we move into the second half of  thank you very much for your attention id now like to turn the call over to jackie jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director thank you scott as youve heard our teams around the world delivered excellent performance during – in the second quarter were wellpositioned to finish the year strong and move into  with great momentum this is the case for our commercial operational and financial performance as well as our clinical regulatory and research performance looking at the  milestones we laid out at the beginning of this year we see that we are outperforming on our financial targets as reflected in our updated guidance today our commercial and operational positions have never been better and set us up extremely well to deliver on our ambitious growth objectives from now to  our franchise teams are driving strong positive commercial trends across our key products and major geographies and our global operational teams are delivering exceptional performance and helping to drive our operating profit growth revlimid pomalystimnovid and abraxane have already attained blockbuster drugs status and otezla is on its way to hitting the  billion annual revenue milestone this year thus becoming the fourth blockbuster in our portfolio all four of these drugs have bright future growth prospects and unique profiles in their therapeutic areas the growth potential across our existing product portfolio from ongoing geographic expansion remains ahead of us and is only one of the factors driving our growth as it contributes alongside enhanced value propositions and ongoing label expansions for our marketed products as well as new product approvals to fuel our expected  revenue constant annual growth rate from  to  our regulatory teams are delivering on key submissions globally and some new approvals have already been achieved our clinical teams are advancing our pipeline projects with milestones hit across a succession of trial initiations enrollment achievements and data readouts our research and early development teams are producing new drug candidates for ind submissions and making progress on the earlystage trials that allow us to advance compounds into a later stage development building on the success achieved to date we enter an exciting multiyear period when we will see numerous phase iii trial readouts by yearend we expect new data and major medical meetings for some of our  trial readouts looking ahead to  we anticipate readouts for hematologyoncology for revlimid in follicular lymphoma and for abraxane and both nonsmall cell lung cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer as michael mentioned turning to ii we expect to see behçets data for otezla and two trials for ozanimod in multiple sclerosis and theres more in  when for hematologyoncology we will have data for abraxane in triple negative breast cancer and pomalyst in secondline multiple myeloma for ii  will bring three trial readouts in the ibd space two in crohns for ged and one for ozanimod in ulcerative colitis these are all major trials and potential major catalysts this portfolio of trials gives us several highquality shots on goal for products and indications that can significantly contribute to future our revenue growth and diversification to conclude i would also point out that in addition to what is shown on this slide we have even more information flow during the remainder of this year as scott mentioned we expect to share week data from the ged endoscopy trial in the second half of the year as we deliver on our milestones we will see a number of phase ii trial readouts from now to the end of the year we also look forward to important data presentations at medical meetings including uegw in october ash in december and san antonio breast in december and we will kick off a new rd deepdive series with an investoranalyst event in september our first topic will be protein homeostasis and where we think the science can take our new product development programs in that area our teams have put us in a fabulous place so far this year and we have even more to come before yearend and great things ahead in   and beyond with that i thank you for listening and i now open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question today comes from the line of cory kasimov with jpmorgan your line is open cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning guys thank you for taking the question congratulations on the progress so im curious as to what kind of impact the darzalex launch is having on your multiple myeloma franchise especially pom and given the combination data thats being generated in the other studies that are ongoing do you see the momentum building for that product as more of an opportunity or a threat for your imid franchise thanks michael pehl  president global hematology and oncology yeah thanks cory this is michael thanks for the question so with what weve been showing you i think its very clear that we have a very good momentum for pomalidomide across the globe and its coming from a couple of factors starting with the fact that there is a need for a product that is oral and effective and welltolerated in the laterline patient population that is the first point which i think leads to some prescriber preference for using such an oral very effective drug in that patient population as compared to an iv drug but i think thats only part of the story what we are seeing with pomalidomide is that its moving up its moving up in third line its moving up even in second line directly after revlimid and we start to see a lot of combinatorial use which has a very positive effect on the clinical benefit that we see on the outcomes of patients but most importantly also on treatment duration so we actually dont see the situation that is building with cd and pomalidomide as competitive we actually see it as complementary the two drugs go extremely well together and what were seeing at this moment of time is a lot of combinatorial use cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of geoff meacham with barclays your line is open geoffrey meacham  barclays capital inc morning guys thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter wanted to ask you guys about the rev and other lymphoma indications specifically how you guys think about costbenefit for the revrituxan combos since rituxans highly effective and reasonably priced what does that do if anything to the hurdle youll need to see for the rev combos going forward thanks michael pehl  president global hematology and oncology so yeah thanks for the question this is michael so i think youre referring to the combinatorial studies that were doing in diffuse large bcell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in combination with rituximab the studies are actually set up in a way that they are with comparing with the current standard of care so in case of induction of diffuse large bcell lymphoma thats rchop which has been standard of care for induction for quite a while and the study has been really set up in order to provide a huge improvement of outcome whats also probably important to note that in this study in diffuse large bcell lymphoma theres a limited treatment duration so we are expecting a very marked outcomes improvement while at the same time theres a limited duration of treatment the situation in follicular lymphoma is building from the observation and the fact that the standard of care at this moment of time is mostly chemotherapy with or without rituximab or rituximab alone we have an elderly frail patient population in follicular lymphoma that is absolutely not tolerating chemotherapy well whether its  based or whether its chopbased or rchop based so theres a true need for improvement of treatment of this patient population again we feel the studies which are randomized studies have been set up in a way that theyre representing a true improvement of standard of care and the outcomes of these patients that should translate in a very positive reimbursement situation for us geoffrey meacham  barclays capital inc got you thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael yee with rbc capital markets your line is open michael yee  rbc capital markets llc hey thanks for the question question for mark or scott on the ged you mentioned it a couple times as a key growth driver and as a catalyst just wanted to understand your current thinking on the endoscopy data specifically how you think about the relationship versus cdai what specifically youre looking for in that study to increase or decrease our confidence on that program and how confident are you on that data thanks so much scott a smith  president global inflammation and immunology thank you for the question michael so the study is ongoing i do not – we havent seen data the  patients are not through the week portion of the data what were querying and what were looking at are three basic things there clinical response clinical remission and then endoscopic improvements during that week timeframe the studys also looking at a slightly different patient population than was looked at in the igon study it is a relatively severe population and theres confirmation of baseline of disease both by cdai and by endoscopy at baseline so thats sort of a difference or a hurdle that other studies have not necessarily engaged in but what it does is it ensures the disease state of the patient at the time of dosing then were looking at  weeks so its an exciting study for us its very data heavy we should learn a lot about ged from that particular study and we look forward to getting the results out in the second half of this year operator thank you our next question comes from the line of eric schmidt with cowen  company your line is open eric schmidt  cowen  co llc thanks peter could you just discuss whats going on with the share count i know you raised the guidance for the share count last quarter now you lowered it and it looks like your guidance for the rest of the year assumes share count goes back up so i was a little confused there and then scott just a quick one on atopic dermatitis otezla it looked like the slides had a check next to that phase ii study does that mean the trial that you have inhouse data on is actually positive thanks peter n kellogg  executive vice president and chief financial officer hi eric good morning so youre right basically we did have a strong share repurchase effort in the first quarter and then also we followed on a bit in the second quarter and so our updated share count for this year really just reflects the fullyear calculation of share count on that basis so clearly the entire biopharma sector particularly biotech was down in the first quarter which we all talked about at that time and we saw our stock price down in the s and so we took advantage of that and used our capacity to get some shares and has for the short term reduced our share count when we go out to  which is i think what youre referring to weve also provided obviously a basis for that guidance that we gave and that was a share count of  million and basically what we were trying to do is kind of levelset for everybody look on this basis this is what the pl should look like on an earningspershare basis so obviously its a long time between now and  so i think theres also things coming and the last thing is just in  remember – in  rather there is some accounting changes which i could get into offline which do have some impact on share count so all those factors come into play but in general i think for  were just trying to help investors think about what they should see as we come in towards yearend on a share count basis scott a smith  president global inflammation and immunology thanks for the question relative to atopic dermatitis yes we just got that data in its a relatively small proofofconcept study – again somewhat dataheavy lots of different things that were looking at in that study the study did enroll a very significant cohort from japan where it is a very significant disease and so weve got that data were working through it and were working on next steps were going to make the fullness of that data available to everybody but right now our focus is understanding the data and working on our next steps operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian abrahams with jefferies your line is open brian abrahams  jefferies llc hey guys thanks very much for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong quarter a question on remarc i realize youre still probably diving into all the details there but im wondering if you had any initial take as to why you mightve seen benefits on pfs without concurrent overall survival benefits was it just an issue of the magnitude of pfs not being clinically meaningful enough are there other potential mechanistic explanations and as you look at the data how does it potentially increase or decrease your level of confidence in the other lymphoma studies recognizing of course that theyre testing slightly different indications thanks michael pehl  president global hematology and oncology yeah hi brian this is michael thanks for the question so as you rightfully said we are really in the midst together with our partner lysa to analyze the data and were going to make sure that were going to have to submit those data to major medical congress at the end of the year so answering the question of the why is definitely following the analysis and i hope we will provide a very robust update by the end of the year on those data the other part of your question was about the correlation of this data with the rest our lymphoma program and i was trying to highlight in my transcript is the fact that theres very different patient segments and very different combinatorial strategies in our program so the remarc study was really done in an elderly firsttime use large bcell highrisk population after rchop and that was a maintenance therapy thats very different from the rest of our program you may recall that the robust study is an induction study in an abc subtype and then we have two other important pivotal studies in follicular lymphoma – again totally different biology and threat  combination so i think its definitely wrong to draw any conclusions from remarc when we are looking at our other studies operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matthew harrison with morgan stanley your line is open matthew k harrison  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks for taking the question scott could i just ask you to help us a little bit on the primary endpoint for the ged study i know its sort of a composite that includes endoscopy  but also has some other components can you just walk us through how we should think about those components and how we should think about any of those scorings relative to what you might see in tnfs or other agents thanks scott a smith  president global inflammation and immunology thanks for the question matthew i assume youre talking about cd the endoscopic study the endpoint there would be change from baseline in endoscopic scope  score which is the primary endpoint there there are a number of exploratory endpoints that would come and that we would look at as well theres been a lot of discussion in the environment over the last   months relative to what should you expect in crohns disease relative to endoscopy and sort of the way that this has evolved is at the early time points whether thats week  week  people are basically looking for a  change in baseline in your sescd scores by the time you get out to week  people are looking at  improvements in the sescd scores and then its – when you get out to around a year  weeks and beyond the people will really look at what we call endoscopic remission or mucosal healing thats when you expect to see that being significant so its following sort of a time sequence you expect to see in an effective drug strong signs of a response early on and then you expect to see from an endoscopic perspective the mucosal of the gi tract getting better and better over time leading to different  but basically   and then mucosal at  weeks is the way that the environment is evolving right now matthew k harrison  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robyn karnauskas with citi your line is open robyn karnauskas  citigroup global markets inc broker hi guys thanks for taking my questions so this is a followup question on endoscopy for scott so is there any scenario where when you get this data set that you would think stopping the phase iii trial or amending the phase iii trial and just to understand a little bit more about what youre saying about really seeing significant mucosal healing by  weeks like what have we seen with other drugs at  weeks on sescd what kind of healing do we have by then and how would you describe it is it a trend have you seen situations where theres none but you get more at  weeks just trying to understand really how much – what information is there out there about the timelines for mucosal healing by  weeks versus the  you just mentioned thank you scott a smith  president global inflammation and immunology thank you very much robyn i cant thoughtfully respond to the first part of the question because the studys not completed and i havent seen the data it is not unusual for large studies to have protocol amendments and some minor changes to statistical plans and things during the course of the execution of the study ive never personally been involved in a study that had no amendments at all from start to finish so some minor amendments can happen for a lot of different reasons specific to this case i havent seen – the studys not complete i havent seen the data so i cant thoughtfully comment on whether theres anything there which would lead us to change but at this point we dont believe that theres anything that we see that would lead to major changes in the program relative to what to expect this is where its a little bit different to take a look at comparables in the external world very few other companies use sescd as the main endpoint to look at endoscopic healing theres been an evolution in time of what endpoint you should use some of the older studies had different endpoints and the other thing that i think is very very important when you look at the data from ged or any new entity in crohns disease from this point forward is were starting to do baseline endoscopy so that we can confirm that there actually is mucosal involvement at baseline the prior studies didnt do that and some of the patients didnt have any lesions when they went into the study maybe didnt have crohns disease and that was one of the development challenges in crohns disease the way to get around that is confirm active disease at baseline so this is a little bit different study its more rigorous from that perspective making sure that theres a mucosal involvement and mucosal damage and then taking a look at with the sescd an endpoint which is different than endpoints that have been used in the past so its a pretty stringent study thats going to give us a really good idea of whats going on in terms of not only signs and symptoms in this population but really importantly whats going on from an endoscopic perspective operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark schoenebaum with evercore isi your line is open mark j schoenebaum  evercore group llc you guys are never supposed to call on robyn before me she worked for me peter n kellogg  executive vice president and chief financial officer hey mark your line is open mark j schoenebaum  evercore group llc yes no i know i was just kidding around im sorry about that guys can you hear me now peter n kellogg  executive vice president and chief financial officer we can hear you now mark j schoenebaum  evercore group llc okay please never call on robyn before me its just weird because she worked with me and by the way i just want to say congrats to scott on the success of otezla a lot of skeptics out there including me its annualizing at  billion but i would like to go back to robyns point i mean when we get this data from the endoscopy trial if we do work on this will we be able to correlate the magnitude of mucosal healing with a clinical outcome is that even possible here because thats what people are going to try to do theyre going to look at it and say is the magnitude of mucosal healing great enough that we could reproduce the phase ii data that were so wonderful and then john  has a question john miller john  youre on mute too we have a mute problem scott a smith  president global inflammation and immunology so can i answer the initial question so you will see in cd both a clinical response from a cdai perspective and clinical remission so you can compare that to what you saw on a slightly different patient population in the igon study the relative correlation between what you see in the mucosal  signs and symptoms and real healing has been an area of major debate particularly in crohns disease much clearer in uc in crohns disease its been an area of major debate there was a couple of recent review articles looking at all the data that are out there and that sort of provide a good picture but the only correlation thats sort of arisen that im aware of that you can see is if you get control from a signs and symptoms perspective early and you start to see some improvements in the mucosa it generally leads to a positive effect when you get out to week  and so thats basically what were looking for in new crohns treatment signs and symptoms significant remissions and signs that its actually starting to work at the early time points youre seeing endoscopic response or endoscopic improvement and those things together yield a high – or a probability of a patient being in longterm remission and getting true endoscopic healing at those longer time points unknown speaker great thanks guys this is john miller  i got to ask about the new regulations and especially with regard to upfronts and licensing payments and the way that you structure these deals i understand youve said you dont expect much of a difference but can you really continue to exclude those from your nongaap metrics under the new regulations peter n kellogg  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah hi john  mark j schoenebaum  evercore group llc jackie you like how i make my associate ask that jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director yes peter n kellogg  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so thanks for the question this is peter so i think we believe that our treatment of strategic collaboration transactions where the portion of an upfront is related to the acquisition of rights is excluded from nongaap is appropriate the acquisition of rights is unique to the formation of the collaboration its very strategic and its not part of our ongoing operations of course subsequently after that collaboration is formed all other ongoing operating costs of the collaboration whether they be development costs they be milestones they be royalties cocommercialization – all the ongoing operational activities that we do together with our collaborator are included in our nongaap presentation so i think thats way weve always thought about it its very hard to forecast strategic transactions its something where i dont think many companies talk about what ma deals theyre going to do next year or what collaboration activity theyre going to do and there are many many reasons that we could talk about in terms of how to think about this and how it makes sense but in the interest of time now since were almost on the hour i wont drag you through all of that at this point but in the interest of time our approach has been consistent for many years its not uncommon across the industry many companies have the same approach and importantly were fully transparent on all the factors we have in our gaaptonongaap presentation always have been and so anybody who wants to particularly look at it slightly differently certainly is able to do that and thats fine so at this point really we feel were right on track with where weve been now i will mention mark j schoenebaum  evercore group llc peter have you talked to the sec yet peter n kellogg  executive vice president and chief financial officer im sorry mark j schoenebaum  evercore group llc have you had a conversation with the sec peter n kellogg  executive vice president and chief financial officer well obviously were always talking to all the government agencies the sec and everybody else so some of those ongoing dialogues occur over lots of different topics basically if something comes out of that that would be actionable well communicate that but at this point really theres not much to talk about patrick e flanigan iii  corporate vice president investor relations hey mark weve got  other analysts who are trying to ask a question so im going to ask that you go back into the queue mark j schoenebaum  evercore group llc yeah im sorry about that patrick e flanigan iii  corporate vice president investor relations and kat i think were ready for the next caller operator thank you our next question comes from the line of katherine breedis with stifel katherine breedis  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi thank you very much for taking the call hello patrick e flanigan iii  corporate vice president investor relations youre live yep go ahead and ask your question katherine katherine breedis  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thank you hi thanks very much for taking my question as a follow up on the ged phase ii endoscopy study are you planning to present other biomarker data of mucosal healing such as fecal calprotectin and fecal lactoferrin i think thatll help provide additional color on the benefit of the therapeutic form of mucosal healing scott a smith  president global inflammation and immunology yes we are collecting those biomarkers and it should be part of either the oral presentation or a publication at some point in time but we are collecting them katherine breedis  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of josh schimmer with piper jaffray your line is open joshua e schimmer  piper jaffray  co broker thanks for taking the question with so many phase iii data readouts between now and  maybe you can help characterize which ones you think are higher probability of success which you think carry a high or higher risk and where would you put  in that spectrum thanks jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director josh hi its jackie im going to jump in and speak on behalf of both franchises but if the franchise heads want to come along after me thats great too were not going to sit here and outline successes or probabilities of success of these trials i think the point is when you look at the portfolio of trials that we have for both franchises and combined what you see are a significant number of phase iii trials and a significant number of phase ii trials coming along behind those where you can find proofofconcept data in a number of settings that support the therapies being studied this is going to evolve over time but weve got some programs that by the very nature of where theyve moved to in phase iii over the course of time have become derisked and were very excited about the totality of the portfolio the indications being studied the products that are in there and the potential that they hold to come in and give us significant diversification and significant support to our revenue growth and upside potential over time so whats extremely exciting is youre going to have this endoscopy data relatively soon and then theres as we mentioned a lot of information flow from now to the end of the year and we will start in the second half of the year to see momentum going into  and youre going to see these follicular trials read out beginning in the first half of  and michael did an extremely thorough job of outlining why we think that we will see success with those treatment regimens and what the differences are versus the remarc trial so we feel great about it and are looking forward to having some of these things start to read out joshua e schimmer  piper jaffray  co broker thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john newman with canaccord your line is open john newman  canaccord genuity inc hi guys good morning thanks a lot for taking my question i will not ask about  since youve had a lot of those my question is on ozanimod in terms of the work youre doing in multiple sclerosis when you brought in the asset you did make some comments regarding commercialization im just wondering if you are still considering the possibility of marketing that product on your own in ms or if its more likely that you would consider a partnership thank you scott a smith  president global inflammation and immunology thank you john where we are right now we would always – similar to what we did with otezla we would always take a look and have some discussions and see whats in the environment theres been a lot of interest in ozanimod in ms and a lot of companies and others have reached out to us the way that i would look at this is that you would like to see the fullness of the program and the phase iii data before finalizing any decision on how youre going to commercialize and any of the commercial aspects including pricing and partnering and our other things so were going to get that data and we should have a good view on that in first half of next year but we feel confident if we make the decision to go ahead and go it alone we feel very confident that we can do that very successfully were doing that right now currently with otezla its a very – relatively tight specialty group of physicians it fits what we do at celgene so if we looked at the data and made an organizational decision to move forward alone we feel very confident that we would be able to do that we would also look to talk to partners as well if that made sense in terms of the overall value of the asset and the reach to patients worldwide patrick e flanigan iii  corporate vice president investor relations great thanks scott so were approaching the hour and i know there are other calls this morning so why dont we take one question and then well wrap up here thank you operator thank you our last question for today will come from the line of chris raymond from raymond james your line is open patrick e flanigan iii  corporate vice president investor relations hey chris your line is open all right kat why dont we go to the next caller operator all right thank you our next question comes from the line of yatin suneja with suntrust your line is open patrick e flanigan iii  corporate vice president investor relations all right it seems like we may be having some technical difficulties on our end why dont we just go ahead and wrap it up jacqualyn a fouse  president chief operating officer  director so yeah thanks everybody for being on the call with us today just a couple of things before we close i think what youre seeing is simply outstanding execution across the franchises that is the culmination of a lot of years of strategic thinking behind everything that were doing as well so lots of exciting data to come for ii weve got multiple new products going to read out soon multiple new indications for hemonc just one thing that i wanted to close with with respect to the myeloma franchise is were in quite a unique position both with respect to our existing assets as well as those that are coming through the pipeline that youll hear more about over the course of the remainder of the year as we have our deep dive event and some other things over time but were the only company with multiple products in multiple myeloma that are positioned very uniquely across the spectrum between relapsed refractory and newly diagnosed with backbone therapies for revlimid and pomalystimnovid that are combining with everything and i think thats something to keep in mind we see a lot of potential very positive momentum based on the data that weve seen so far both in the relapsedrefractory setting for combos as well as the newly diagnosed setting for combos irrespective of which novel agent is coming along so everythings looking great thank you very much thanks again to our teams for a great second quarter
