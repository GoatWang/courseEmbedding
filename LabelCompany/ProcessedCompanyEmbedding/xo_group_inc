accounting and reporting standards  procedures nongaap information xo group inc also uses certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap including adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow these nongaap measures have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under us gaap our use of these terms may vary from the use of similarlytitled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation management defines its nongaap financial measures as follows adjusted ebitda represents us gaap net income loss adjusted to exclude if applicable  provision benefit for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stockbased compensation expense  impairment charges and asset writeoffs  loss in equity interests  interest and other income net  net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest and  other items impacting comparability in the period adjusted net income represents us gaap net income loss adjusted for incremental or unusual costs incurred in the current period which may include  impairment charges and asset writeoffs  executive severance and other restructuring charges and  the impact of certain foreign taxes interest and penalties adjusted net income per diluted share represents adjusted net income as defined above divided by the diluted weightedaverage number of shares outstanding for the period free cash flow represents us gaap net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures management believes that these nongaap financial measures when viewed with our results under us gaap and the accompanying reconciliations provide useful information about our periodoverperiod growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating our operating performance however adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and accordingly should not be considered substitutes for or superior to net income loss and net income loss per diluted share and net cash provided by operating activities as indicators of operating performance a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap financial measures is included in the periodic reports and other documents filed from timetotime by xo group with the securities and exchange commission agree decline
