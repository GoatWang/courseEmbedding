federal taxexempt income and to preserve capital the trust is a unit investment trust included in invesco unit trusts municipal series  monthly distributions estimated current return  estimated long term return  estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each year divided by the unit price estimated long term return shows the estimated return over the estimated life of your trust these estimates are as of the opening of business on the date of deposit and will vary thereafter we base this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life this estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses we derive the average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bonds yield by its value and estimated life unlike estimated current return estimated long term return accounts for maturities discounts and premiums of the bonds these estimates show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns no return calculation can predict your actual return your actual return may vary from these estimates prospectus part i march   this prospectus contains two parts no one may use this prospectus part i unless accompanied by prospectus part ii you should read this prospectus and retain it for future reference the securities and exchange commission has not approved or disapproved of the trust units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus any contrary representation is a criminal offense invesco investment objective the trust seeks to provide federal taxexempt income and to preserve capital principal investment strategy the trust invests in a portfolio of municipal bonds issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the united states and political subdivisions and authorities thereof the interest on which is in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities excludable from gross income for federal personal income tax purposes under existing law in selecting bonds for the trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others o a standard  poors rating of at least a a moodys investors service inc rating of at least a or if not rated the bonds had credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the trust in the opinion of the sponsor o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk the portfolio generally consists of bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit following the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced and the trust could continue to hold such bond see trust administrationportfolio administration in prospectus part ii principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in the trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o bond prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future o a bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest andor principal payments in the future o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o a bond issuer might prepay or call a bond before its stated maturity if this happens the trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall a bonds call price could be less than the price the trust paid for the bond if enough bonds are called the trust could terminate earlier than expected o the trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer this makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than a more diversified portfolio the types of bonds in the portfolio are listed under the bonds in prospectus part ii o we do not actively manage the trusts portfolio except in limited circumstances the trust will hold the same bonds even if the market value declines summary of

to a return of principal this return of principal may offer unitholders the opportunity to respond to changing economic conditions and to specific financial needs that may arise during the periods of

insurance on the bonds see insurance on the bonds in the insured trusts in selecting bonds for a trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others a as of the date of deposit the bonds are rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization in the category described in prospectus part i for the particular trust or if not rated have credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by such trust in the opinion of the sponsor b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the current income provided by the bonds d the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and e the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration the bonds your trust invests in municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds the sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by type of bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds and percentages they represent in your portfolio are listed in prospectus part i these bonds are also described in greater detail in the information supplement general obligation bonds and revenue bonds general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds

multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are

utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also included in the portfolio and notes thereto in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the date of deposit this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds also since interest on any when as and if issued bonds does not begin accruing as taxexempt interest income to the benefit of unitholders until the date of delivery the trustee may reduce its fee and pay trust expenses in order to maintain or approach the same estimated net annual interest income during the first year of the trusts operations as described under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i municipal bond risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment current economic conditions the markets for credit instruments including corporate bonds and municipal securities have experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility since the latter half of  the current economic environment has made conditions difficult for virtually all industries and companies to operate in an efficient manner general market uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety of debt securities these conditions resulted and in many cases continue to result in greater volatility less liquidity widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value these market conditions may make valuation of some of the trusts bonds uncertain andor result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early the first date that the issuer can call each bond is listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i along with the price the issuer would have to pay some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events the call provisions are described in general terms in the redemption feature column of the portfolio section in prospectus part i and the notes thereto additional discussion of call provisions appears in the information supplement bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described under the bonds reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could lose income andor principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond both default in making their payment obligations liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust for example future legislation could reduce tax rates impose a flat tax exempt all investment income from tax or change the tax status of the bonds litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds state risk factors your trust may invest significantly in taxexempt municipal bonds of issuers from a particular state the financial condition of a state may be affected by various national economic social and environmental policies and conditions additionally limitations imposed by constitutional amendments legislative measures or voter initiatives on a state and its local governments concerning taxes bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenuegenerating capacity of the state and its local governments and therefore the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations the economic vitality of a state and its various regions and therefore the ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds are affected by numerous factors such as natural disasters complications with exports and industry deregulation a state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision could materially affect the states governmental operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return as of the date of deposit are set forth on the cover of the prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trust and with the principal prepayment default if any redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated dates and amounts of principal returned on the bonds while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price public offering general units are offered at the public offering price during the initial offering period the public offering price is based on the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account including cash to pay organization costs and accrued interest if any organization costs are not included in the public offering price per unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge if you purchase units during the initial offering period of a trust with a deferred sales charge your sales charge will consist of i an initial sales charge paid upon the purchase of your units and ii the remaining deferred sales charge which consists of a fixed dollar amount per unit paid in installments on specified deferred sales charge payment dates in no event will your combined initial sales charge and deferred sales charge exceed the maximum percentage sales charge for the applicable trust as set forth above for more details including the specific amount and method of calculation of the initial and deferred sales charge for those trusts which offer a deferred sales charge see the fee table in prospectus part i of the applicable trust after the initial public offering period the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the maximum initial offering period sales charges are as follows initial

bonds if you purchase units in the secondary market of a trust with a deferred sales charge your maximum sales charge will be based on the remaining eltr life of the trust as described above and will consist of an initial sales charge and the remaining deferred sales charge if any if the secondary market units are purchased prior to the final deferred sales charge payment date the initial sales charge which you pay at the time of purchase is the difference between the secondary market sales charge based on the eltr life listed above and the maximum remaining deferred sales charge if you purchase units after the last deferred sales charge payment has been assessed your maximum sales charge will consist of the one time initial sales charge based on the eltr life reducing your sales charge the sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales charge that you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert the sponsor of any discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your brokerdealer of your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a reduced sales charge you may not combine discounts for trusts with a deferred sales charge these charges are fixed dollar amounts per unit and your trust must charge these amounts per unit regardless of any discounts however if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charges you will receive a credit equal to the difference between your total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges at the time you buy units large quantity purchases you can reduce your sales charge by increasing the size of your investment if you purchase the

only to the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the sponsor please refer to the section called fee accounts for additional information on these purchases units may be purchased in the initial offering period at the public offering price less the maximum applicable concession the sponsor typically allows to brokers and dealers either nonunderwriter or underwriter concession whichever is greater for purchases by investors who purchase units through registered investment advisers certified financial planners and registered brokerdealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services financial planning investment advisory or asset management services or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive wrap fee charge wrap fee is imposed fee accounts if the units are purchased for a fee account and the trust is subject to a wrap fee ie the trust is wrap fee eligible for example with respect to a longterm trust such as imit wrap fee eligible purchasers would pay  per unit which represents the maximum sales charge of  per unit minus the maximum applicable concession of  per

public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the price of units as of the opening of business on the date of deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge and organization costs to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding this price determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the evaluator during the initial offering period the evaluator will value the bonds as of the evaluation time on days the new york stock exchange is open for business and will adjust the public offering price of units accordingly the evaluation time is the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for trading or earlier on days where the bond market association recommends an early bond market close provided however on the date of deposit the evaluation time will be the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec becomes effective if later the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to range approximately from  to  more than the bid price the public offering price per unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the evaluation time on each business day orders received by the sponsor prior to the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the evaluation time that are properly transmitted to the sponsor by the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of receipt orders received by the sponsor after the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals after the evaluation time or orders received by such persons that are not transmitted to the sponsor until after the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of the next determined public offering price per unit provided they are received timely by the sponsor on such date it is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders received by them to the sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or offering prices as is appropriate a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the trusts b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  organization costs during the initial offering period part of the public offering price represents an amount of cash deposited to pay the estimated costs incurred in establishing your trust these costs include the costs of preparing documents relating to the trust such as the registration statement prospectus trust agreement and legal documents federal and state registration fees the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and the initial audit your trust will reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six months if earlier the value of your units will decline when the trust deducts these costs from the trust assets accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid by the bonds semiannually although each trust accrues interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units you will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your units on the next distribution date in an effort to reduce the accrued interest which would have to be paid by unitholders the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unitholders if you sell or redeem all or a portion of your units you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of your units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by underwriters brokerdealers and others at the public offering price plus accrued interest the sponsor intends to

unit or value at the time of purchase the trustee will distribute to each unitholder his share of the balance of the interest and principal accounts after deduction of costs expenses or indemnities

discussion of certain federal income tax consequences arising from the purchase ownership and disposition of units of a trust that intends to qualify as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes the summary is limited to investors who hold the units as capital assets generally property held for investment within the meaning of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code unitholders should consult their tax advisers in determining the federal state local and any other tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of units tax status of the trusts the trusts have elected to qualify and intend to qualify annually as regulated investment companies under subchapter m of the code to qualify as a regulated investment company a trust must distribute to its unitholders at least  of its investment company taxable income which includes among other items dividends taxable interest if any and the excess of net shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses and  of its taxexempt interest income and meet certain diversification of assets source of income and other requirements by meeting these requirements a trust generally will not be subject to federal income tax on investment company taxable income and on net capital gains the excess of net longterm capital gains over net shortterm capital losses reported by a trust as capital gain dividends distributed to unitholders a trust can also avoid an annual nondeductible  excise tax if each calendar year it distributes substantially all of its ordinary income short and longterm capital gain and any previously undistributed and untaxed amounts if for any taxable year a trust did not qualify as a regulated investment company all of its taxable income would be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to unitholders and any distributions would be taxable to the unitholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of such trusts current or accumulated earnings and profits such distributions generally would be eligible for the dividends received deduction in the case of corporate unitholders and the lower federal income tax rate currently applicable to qualifying dividend income for individual unitholders provided certain holding period requirements were satisfied by the trust and the respective unitholders the trusts may be subject to state or local tax in jurisdictions in which the trusts are organized or may be deemed to be doing business distributions each trust intends to make sufficient distributions of investment company taxable income if any capital gains if any and exemptinterest dividends each year in order to qualify as a regulated investment company and to avoid any trustlevel federal income or excise taxes each trust intends to be eligible to distribute exemptinterest dividends to unitholders by holding a sufficient amount of its assets in bonds generating interest that is exempt from federal income taxation under section  of the code such exemptinterest dividends are not subject to regular federal income tax but may be subject to alternative minimum tax distributions of investment company taxable income including net shortterm capital gains if any are taxable to unitholders as ordinary income and generally will not qualify for treatment as qualified dividend income currently taxed at a maximum rate of  for individual unitholders or for the dividendsreceived deduction for corporate unitholders any income from your trust that you must take into account for federal tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any net capital gains of a trust net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss if any realized and distributed by such trust and reported as capital gain dividends are taxable to unitholders as longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of  without regard to the length of time the unitholder may have held his or her units in the trust capital gain dividends are not eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction for corporate unitholders in determining the amount of capital gains to be distributed by a trust any capital loss carry over from a prior year will be taken into account in determining the amount of net longterm capital gain taxable distributions are taxable to investors whether received in cash or reinvested in additional units when the bonds owned by the trusts were issued special bond counsel issued opinions that the interest on the bonds is not subject to regular federal income tax except in the limited circumstances referred to below payments that a trust receives on a bank letter of credit guarantee or insurance policy because the bond issuer has defaulted should be treated as payments on the bond namely as payments of principal or interest that are not subject to regular federal income tax or taxable market discount or capital gain the taxexempt status of the interest depends on compliance by the issuer and others with ongoing requirements and the opinions of bond counsel assume that these requirements will be met however there is no guarantee that the issuers and other users will comply with these requirements a trust may have to accrue and distribute income not yet received if it invests in bonds issued at a discount a trust may be required to sell bonds that it otherwise would have continued to hold in order to generate sufficient cash to make this distribution the interest on some private activity bonds is a preference item included in alternative minimum taxable income each year the trusts will give to unitholders a report showing the percentage of the trusts income that is a preference item in addition alternative minimum taxable income of a corporate unitholder is increased by part of the excess of its adjusted current earnings an alternative measure of income that includes interest on all tax exempt securities over the amount otherwise determined to be alternative minimum taxable income therefore the exemptinterest dividends may cause a unitholder to have to pay the federal alternative minimum tax or may increase the amount of that tax payable by a unitholder already subject to federal alternative minimum tax the trusts may own bonds originally issued at a discount in general original issue discount is the difference between the price at which a bond was issued and its stated redemption price at maturity original issue discount on taxexempt bonds accrues as taxexempt interest over the life of the bond a trusts adjusted tax basis for a bond issued with original issue discount will include original issue discount accrued during the period it held the bond a trust may also pay a premium when it buys a bond even a bond issued with original issue discount a trust may be required to amortize the premium over the term of the bond and reduce its basis for the bond even though it does not get any deduction for the amortization therefore sometimes the trust may have a taxable gain when it sells a bond for an amount equal to or less than its original tax basis unitholders may receive ordinary income dividends from a trust if the trust sells or redeems bonds that were acquired at a market discount or sells bonds at a short term capital gain in general the internal revenue service irs will treat bonds as market discount bonds when the cost of the bond plus any original issue discount that has not yet accrued is less than the amount due to be paid at the maturity of the bond the irs generally taxes all or a portion of the gain on the sale of a market discount bond as ordinary income when the bond is sold redeemed or paid the portion of the gain taxed by the irs as ordinary income is equal to the portion of the market discount that has accrued since the seller purchased the bond some of the bonds held by the trusts may lose their taxexempt status while they are owned by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of those bonds or by persons related to a substantial user a substantial user is a person whose gross revenue derived with respect to the facilities financed by the bonds is more than  of the total revenue derived by all users of those facilities or who occupies more than  of the usable area of the facilities or for whom the facilities or a part thereof were specifically constructed reconstructed or acquired related persons are certain related individuals affiliated corporations partners and partnerships this rule would not change the taxexempt status of interest on bonds held by other persons these rules may apply to a unitholder who receives exemptinterest dividends attributable to interest on bonds that financed facilities for which such unitholder or a related person is a substantial user individuals must take exemptinterest dividends into consideration in computing the portion if any of social security benefits that will be included in their gross income and subject to federal income tax if a trust declares dividends in october november or december that are payable to unitholders of record on a date during those months unitholders must take the dividends into account for tax purposes in the current year if the dividend is paid either in the current year or in january of the following year ordinary exemptinterest and capital gain dividends will be taxable as described above whether received in cash or reinvested in additional units if a trust invests in securities of foreign issuers it may be subject to withholding and other similar income taxes imposed by a foreign country dividends and distributions may also be subject to state and local taxes investors should carefully consider the tax implications of buying units prior to a distribution by a trust the price of units purchased at that time includes the amount of the forthcoming distributions distributions by a trust reduce the net asset value of such trusts units and if a distribution reduces the net asset value below a unitholders cost basis such distribution nevertheless could be taxable to the unitholder as ordinary income or capital gain as described above even though from an investment standpoint it may constitute a partial return of capital sale or redemption of units upon the taxable disposition including a sale or redemption of units of a trust a unitholder may realize a gain or loss depending upon such unitholders adjusted tax basis in the units and the amount of sale or redemption proceeds such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the units are capital assets in the unitholders hands and will be longterm or shortterm generally depending upon the unitholders holding period for the units noncorporate unitholders are currently subject to tax at a maximum federal rate of  on capital gains resulting from the disposition of units held for more than  months zero if the taxpayer is and would be after accounting for such gains subject to the federal  or  tax bracket for ordinary income however a loss realized by a unitholder on the disposition of units with respect to which capital gains dividends have been paid will to the extent of such capital gain dividends also be treated as longterm capital loss if such shares have been held by the unitholder for six months or less further a loss realized on a disposition will be disallowed to the extent the units disposed of are replaced whether by reinvestment of distributions or otherwise within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the units are disposed of in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss capital losses in any year are deductible only to the extent of capital gains plus in the case of a noncorporate taxpayer  of ordinary income  for married individuals filing separately backup withholding the trusts generally must withhold and pay over to the us treasury as backup withholding at a current rate of  of the taxable dividends and other distributions paid to any individual unitholder who either does not supply its taxpayer identification number has not reported all of its dividends and interest income or does not certify to a trust that he or she is not subject to withholding the social security number of an individual is his or her taxpayer identification number backup withholding also may be required for a unitholder upon notification of the trust by the irs backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld may be credited against a unitholders ultimate federal income tax liability if proper documentation is provided foreign withholding unitholders who are not us persons should consult their tax adviser regarding the us and foreign tax consequences of ownership of units including the possibility that such a unitholder may be subject to a us withholding tax at a rate of  or at a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty on amounts received from a trust information statements after the end of each fiscal year for a trust the trustee will furnish to each unitholder a statement containing information regarding the amount of exemptinterest dividends ordinary dividends and capital gain dividends distributed to such unitholder during the fiscal year investors should consult their tax advisers prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisers concerning the federal state local foreign and any other tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of units based on their individual circumstances additional tax information is contained in the information supplement expenses general the trustee will periodically deduct from the interest account and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the principal account amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trusts provided that organization costs and deferred sales

associated with such bonds the types of bonds included in each trust are described under portfolio in the related prospectus part i neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds general obligation bonds and revenue bonds certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest however the taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited by provisions of state constitutions or laws and an entitys credit will depend on many factors some such factors are the entitys tax base the extent to which the entity relies on federal or state aid and other factors which are beyond the entitys control revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in a trust both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors housing bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from mortgage loans certain of such housing bonds may be fha insured multifamily housing revenue bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to housing projects for low to moderate income families single family mortgage revenue bonds are issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income the ability of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be affected by various economic and noneconomic factors such factors include occupancy levels adequate rental income in multifamily projects the rate of default on mortgage loans underlying single family issuers and the ability of mortgage insurers to pay claims mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds in connection with the housing bonds held by a trust the sponsor at the date of deposit is not aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates health care bonds certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other health care facilities efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance the funding of medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs it also may be necessary for a hospital or other health care facility to incur substantial capital expenditures or increased operating expenses to effect changes in its facilities equipment personnel and services hospitals and other health care facilities are additionally subject to claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that a claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of a health care facility or that insurance coverage will be available to a facility public utility and wholesale electric bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas general problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds water and sewer bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances industrial revenue bonds certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs irbs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers in some cases a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected lease obligation bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity hereinafter called lease obligations lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation although the lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the municipalitys taxing power is pledged a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipalitys covenant to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation however certain lease obligations contain nonappropriation clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby although nonappropriation lease obligations are secured by the leased property disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove difficult higher educations and public education bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trusts general problems relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other funds the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers airport and transportation bonds certain of the bonds in certain of the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements from time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints acts of terrorism and other factors and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents waste disposal bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds original issue discount bonds certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in a trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount bonds will be reduced a bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates see federal tax status in prospectus part ii market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest when as and if issued bonds certain of the bonds may have been purchased on a when as and if issued or delayed delivery basis the delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery to the extent any bonds are actually delivered to a trust after their respective expected dates of delivery unitholders who purchase their units prior to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the trustee would be required to adjust their tax basis in their units for a portion of the interest accruing on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of units and the actual delivery of such bonds as a result of any such adjustment the estimated current returns during the first year would be slightly lower than those stated in the prospectus which would be the returns after the first year assuming the portfolio of a trust and estimated annual expenses other than that of the trustee which may be reduced in the first year only do not vary from that set forth in prospectus part i unitholders will be at risk with respect to all bonds in the portfolios including when as and if issued and delayed delivery bonds ie may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of such bonds from the date they commit for units redemption or sale prior to maturity certain of the bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise a sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement of debt a callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new debt obligation in general call provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions it may also affect the current return on units of the trust involved each trust portfolio contains a listing of the sinking fund and call provisions if any with respect to each of the debt obligations extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of certain events generally events that may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include among others a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used an exercise by a local state or federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities such as taxes not imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds an administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds the issuer of certain bonds in a trust may have sold or reserved the right to sell upon the satisfaction of certain conditions to third parties all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such bonds in such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party a third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights the sponsor is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds see also the discussion of single family mortgage and multifamily revenue bonds above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon any of the trusts at any time after the date of deposit litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a trust such litigation as for example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental protection statutes may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted each trust has received or will receive opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is exempt from federal income tax in addition other factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds puerto rico risk factors your trust may significantly invest in bonds issued by issuers located in puerto rico accordingly an investment in such a trust should be made with an understanding of the general risks associated with the commonwealth of puerto rico geographic location and demography the commonwealth of puerto rico puerto rico or the commonwealth is the fourth largest of the caribbean islands and is located approximately  miles southeast of new york it is approximately  miles long and  miles wide according to the united states census bureau the population of puerto rico was approximately  in   as of july   according to a united states census bureau estimate compared to  in  however the puerto rico planning board the planning board estimates that as of july  the population will be approximately  relationship with the united states puerto rico came under united states sovereignty pursuant to the treaty of paris signed on december   which ended the spanishamerican war puerto ricans have been citizens of the united states since  in  after a long evolution toward greater selfgovernment congress enacted public law  which provided that the existing political economic and fiscal relationship between puerto rico and the united states would remain the same but puerto rico would be authorized to draft and approve its own constitution guaranteeing a republican form of government the constitution of puerto rico was drafted by a constituent commission approved in a special referendum by the people of puerto rico amended and ratified by the united states congress and subsequently approved by the president of the united states the official designation of the government or body politic has henceforth been estado libre asociado which literally translates to free associated state and has been called commonwealth by the united states government the united states and the commonwealth share a common defense market and currency puerto rico exercises virtually the same control over its internal affairs as any of the fifty states of the united states however it differs from the states in its relationship with the united states federal government the people of puerto rico are citizens of the united states but do not vote in national elections they can only vote in local puerto rico elections the people of the commonwealth are represented in congress by a resident commissioner who has a voice in the house of representatives and limited voting power puerto rico is a selfgoverning commonwealth in association with the united states the chief of state of the commonwealth is the president of the united states the head of government is an elected governor there are two legislative chambers the house of representatives  seats and the senate  seats while puerto rico has authority over its internal affairs the united states controls interstate trade foreign relations and commerce customs administration control of air land and sea immigration and emigration nationality and citizenship currency maritime laws military service military bases army navy and air force declaration of war constitutionality of laws jurisdictions and legal procedures treaties radio and television communications agriculture mining and minerals highways postal system social security and other areas generally controlled by the federal government in the united states puerto rican institutions control internal affairs unless us law is involved as in matters of public health and pollution the major differences between puerto rico and the  states are puerto ricos local taxation system and exemption from internal revenue code its lack of voting representation in either house of the us congress the ineligibility of puerto ricans to vote in presidential elections and its lack of assignation of some revenues reserved for the states economy the commonwealth has established policies and programs directed principally at developing the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy and expanding and modernizing the commonwealths infrastructure domestic and foreign investment have been stimulated by selective tax exemptions development loans and other financial and tax incentives infrastructure expansion and modernization have been primarily financed by bonds and notes issued by the commonwealth its public corporations and municipalities economic progress has been aided by significant increases in the levels of education and occupational skills of the commonwealths population the economy of puerto rico is closely linked to the united states economy as most of the external factors that affect the puerto rico economy other than oil prices are determined by the policies and performance of the mainland economy these external factors include exports direct investment the amount of federal transfer payments the level of interest rates the rate of inflation and tourist expenditures during fiscal year  july  through june  approximately  of puerto ricos exports went to the united states mainland which was also the source of approximately  of puerto ricos imports puerto ricos economy has been in a recession that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  a fiscal year in which the real gross national product grew by only  although puerto ricos economy is closely linked with the united states economy for fiscal years  and  puerto ricos real gross national product decreased by  and  respectively while the united states economy grew at a rate of  and  respectively during the same periods according to the planning boards recent projections the economic contraction has accelerated in fiscal year  with an expected further reduction in real gross national product of  while this trend was expected to continue in fiscal year  the expected positive impact of the us federal and local economic stimulus measures led the planning board to announce revised projections for fiscal year  reflecting a projected increase in real gross national product of  the planning board is also projecting increases in real gross national product of  and  for fiscal years  and  respectively the dominant sectors of the puerto rico economy are manufacturing and services the manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the years as a result of increased emphasis on higher wage high technology industries such as pharmaceuticals electronics computers microprocessors professional and scientific instruments and certain high technology machinery and equipment the service sector including finance insurance real estate wholesale and retail trade and tourism also plays a major role in the economy it ranks second only to manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic product and leads all sectors in providing employment the puerto rico planning boards preliminary reports of the performance of the puerto ricos economy during fiscal year  indicate that the economy registered a decrease of  over fiscal year  in total real gross product gross product in fiscal year  was  billion and gross product in fiscal year  was  billion this represents an increase in gross product of  from fiscal year  to fiscal year  aggregate personal income increased from  billion in fiscal year  to  billion in fiscal year  and personal income per capita increased from  in fiscal year  to  in fiscal year  the significant increase in personal income in fiscal year  is due in part to the tax rebate program implemented by the bush administration during that fiscal year among the variables contributing to the decrease in gross national product were the continuous contraction of the manufacturing and construction sectors as well as the current contraction of us economic activity furthermore the decline in puerto ricos gross national product was not offset by the federal tax rebates due to the high levels of oil prices during fiscal year  the persistent high level of the price of oil and its derivatives such as gasoline during that period served to reduce the income available for other purchases and thereby negatively affected domestic demand due to the commonwealths dependence on oil for power generation and gasoline in spite of its recent improvements in powerproduction diversification the high level of oil prices accounted for an increased outflow of local income in fiscal year  the current difficulties associated with the financial crisis resulted in lower shortterm interest rates but this did not translate into an improvement in the construction sector according to the department of labor and human resources household employment survey total employment for fiscal year  averaged  a decrease of  from the previous fiscal year the unemployment rate for fiscal year  was  an increase from  for fiscal year  debt revenues and expenditures the constitution of puerto rico limits the amount of general obligation full faith and credit debt that can be issued or guaranteed by the commonwealth the commonwealths policy has been and continues to be to maintain the amount of such debt prudently below the constitutional limitation direct debt of the commonwealth is supported by commonwealth taxes debt of municipalities of the commonwealth other than bond anticipation notes is supported by real and personal property taxes and municipal license taxes as of december   total public sector debt of the commonwealth was equal to  million the general fund revenue projection for fiscal year  was  billion an increase of  million or  from estimated net revenues for fiscal year  of  billion the commonwealths budgeted expenditures for fiscal

amount of bonds a trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the underwriters including the sponsor so that the

will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser the trust agreement provides that each trust shall terminate upon the redemption sale or other disposition of the last bond held in such trust but in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth anniversary of the trust agreement in the case of an imit an imit laddered series an

any accrued costs expenses or indemnities provided by the trust agreement including estimated compensation of the trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other government charges the sale of bonds in the trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time for this reason among others the amount realized by a unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the units held by such unitholder the trustee shall then distribute to each unitholder his share of the balance of the interest and principal accounts with such distribution the unitholder shall be furnished a final distribution statement of the amount distributable at such time as the trustee in its sole discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary it shall make distribution thereof to unitholders in the same manner notwithstanding the foregoing in connection with final distributions to unitholders of an insured trust it should be noted that because the portfolio insurance obtained by an insured trust if any is applicable only while bonds so insured are held by such trust the price to be received by such trust upon the disposition of any such bond which is in default by reason of nonpayment of principal or interest will not reflect any value based on such insurance therefore in connection with any liquidation it shall not be necessary for the trustee to and the trustee does not currently intend to dispose of any bond or bonds if retention of such bond or bonds until due shall be deemed to be in the best interest of unitholders including but not limited to situations in which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices resulting from a significant risk of default since the preinsured bonds will reflect the value of the related insurance it is the present intention of the sponsor not to direct the trustee to hold any of such preinsured bonds after the date of termination all proceeds received less applicable expenses from insurance on defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will ultimately be distributed to unitholders of record as of such date of termination as soon as practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds become due and applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the trustee description of ratings standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies a standard  poors longterm debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation this opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold the debt obligation inasmuch as they do not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are based on current information furnished by the obligor or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any credit rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information credit ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or based on other circumstances the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation applies when an entity has both senior and subordinate obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations accordingly in the case of junior debt the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition aaaan obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aaan obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong aan obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbban obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories nrthis indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poors does not rate a particular obligation as a

return tables as of the date of the prospectus part i the following tables show the approximate taxable estimated current returns for individuals that are equivalent to taxexempt estimated current returns under combined federal and state taxes where applicable using the published marginal federal and state tax rates currently scheduled to be in effect in  these tables illustrate approximately what you would have to earn on taxable investments to equal the taxexempt estimated current return in your income tax bracket the tables assume that federal taxable income is equal to state income subject to tax and for cases in which more than one state rate falls within a federal bracket the state rate corresponding to the highest income within that federal bracket is used the combined federal and state tax rates shown reflect the fact that state tax payments are currently deductible for federal tax purposes the tables do not reflect any local taxes any alternative minimum taxes or any taxes other than personal income taxes the tables do not show the approximate taxable estimated current returns for individuals that are subject to the alternative minimum tax the tables do not reflect the effect of federal or state limitations if any on the amount of allowable itemized deductions or credits see federal tax status in prospectus part ii for a more detailed discussion of
