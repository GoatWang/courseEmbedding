shares next story is competition really for losers defying its critics and building on the success of players like wealthfront and betterment aspiration the new money management firm launched by andrei cherny is off to a roaring start the company has  customers paying for its initial wealth management product a portfolio of mutual funds operated by emerald asset managment a pennsylvaniabased asset management firm in all the company has received  million to manage for its clients that total is a fraction of wealthfront’s  billion in assets but not too shabby for a firm that’s a little less than two months into its money management “we basically disintermediate the financial industry and provide financial advisory products direct to the customer” says cherny aspiration differentiates itself from other asset managers through its paywhatyouwill approach to fees which cherny sees as a way to bring in investors who mistrust the larger financial institutions thanks to their role in last decade’s financial crisis in addition to its laissezfaire approach to fees aspiration also includes a charitable component as part of its mission the company gives away  of its revenue to charitable causes like microlending while fees are determined by the investor there are other costs that are associated with fund management that aspiration has to pass through to its customers roughly  of the company’s flagship fund assets are taken out as fees that are paid to the mutual funds that the firm has selected as part of its portfolio cherny likes where aspiration is headed “we amassed more than  people on our waiting list and started sending out invites two months ago we have more paying customers in our first two months than either wealthfront learnvest or futureadvisor in their first year” he says and the paywhatyouwish model seems to be working according to cherny “we’re actually finding that the majority of our customers are paying us the amount that is the suggested amount — or even more” he says a typical aspiration customer is under  making around  in annual salary and for many of them aspiration is their first mutual fund “roughly  of our clients do not own a mutual fund other than the one they just purchased with aspiration” says cherny another  of them don’t even own a stock over  don’t own a mutual fund” cherny says he cautions that it’s not necessarily the best idea for people and says that his company will be rolling out new products for investors to increase the diversification of their investments “we are bringing directconsumer products from the best fund managers in the world to the customers who need those products” says cherny    shares advertisement advertisement crunchbase aspiration overview aspiration is an online financial firm that

admiralty waymarina del rey ca usa phone  website  aspiration  financial product reviews financial product reviewsfinancial product reviews  saverocityaspiration july   by matt  comment it’s been a while since i did a product review but aspiration leaped out at me this week  we started to discuss them in the forum to see if they might be a good investment option  and then today they ran a new ad campaign trying to benefit from the current little spat between betterment and wealthfront which is over a  monthly fee oh the humanityso enter aspiration  they make bold claims positioning themselves as the firm you can trust the firm that isn’t like wall st and is designed for the average middle class american  they cite transparency and openness and they offer something interesting you pick what you pay in feessounds amazing right  conscience trust middle class… focused on keywords like trust and aiming at the little guy differentiation note the fee section fees seem so much more trustworthyso what are you thinking so far  pretty cool company and you pay what you want in fees what the heck  let’s do this… but before we dive in perhaps there are other fees to consider  for example the robo giants of betterment and wealthfront both charge a management fee around  on top of the underlying etfs that make up the portfolio  maybe there’s some underlying fees to look at with these guys too and your choice is to pick the management fee aspect no catchi have to say i love the transparency here the confidence in which they say this makes me feel that ‘trust’ they talk about  great stuff what are aspiration’s fees what is “pay what is fair”most investment firms impose a flat management fee on their customers that means you pay a set amount no matter how well the investment does how hard the adviser is working or how much you like what the company stands for we think that’s not right and not respectful to customersinstead at aspiration you decide how much to pay us we’re confident enough in our products and confident enough in the honor of our customers to trust you to do the right thing we call this “pay what is fair” because this fee model is fair to you and because we’re counting on you to be fair to us we will not earn a cent from you other than the fee you select no feeslooking good click around a bit more and we are sent to an external website that discusses their funds a little more deeply but wait here’s a fee fees appearlet’s pause a moment to see if you kept up with all that no fee no fee no fee fee shazam and ask a quick questionif you invest with aspiration how much will you pay in feesthe savvy among you might think that it would be   a ‘tip’ perhaps something between  for their management fee compared to betterment charging perhaps  for their underlying etfs and a  management fee  kinda close maybe lean towards the robotsthat’s actually what i thought on first glance too but when you look at the prospectus for the above fund something odd happens  you have to go off this website and to the sec to find it the folk at aspiration sent me the link for some reason and you get the followingaspiration flagship fund sec filing sec filing for fund the fees…the left column shows how much you would pay in fees if you paid no fees   the right column is for illustration and shows what you would pay in fees if you elected to pay the top end of the ‘tip’ at  you’d be looking at   it’s worth noting that this entire fee doesn’t go to the firm but the point is that fees are deducted from your earnings and it appears they could be up to x more than the robo firms that they are bashing on twitterinteresting stuff  share this twitter facebook google linkedin comments robert mcnamara says september   at  pm so another

companies whose sustainable environmental social and governance practice yield strong financial returns nov   am est los angeles nov   prnewswire  aspiration an online financial firm with a conscience today announced the launch of the aspiration redwood fund a unique financial product paralleling the approach taken by the sustainable accounting standards board  many americans especially millennials

to investing in a manner designed to combine social and financial goals available exclusively on aspirationcom the aspiration redwood fund is managed daytoday by ubs asset management americas inc based on a strategy available to ubs institutional and private wealth clients people are driving hybrids drinking fair trade coffee and buying organic milk but we think everyday investors have found that when it comes to investing their options are to hold their nose accept lower returns or just walk away said andrei cherny ceo of aspiration  the aspiration redwood fund seeks to give everyone the chance to invest with their values in mind and build value at the same time we see sustainable and impact investing solutions as experiencing unprecedented demand and our aim with the aspiration redwood fund is to help move sustainable investing from a niche for the few to a core allocation in the everyday investors portfolio just a year old aspiration – an online financial firm with a conscience – has become one of the fastest growing investment businesses in america over the past nine months aspiration has been doubling its number of accounts an average of every six weeks in the past socially responsible investing meant stripping out negative factors such as oil and tobacco production which sometimes resulted in lower returns  however recent studies have shown that sustainable companies that make materially impactful decisions to strengthen their environmental workplace and governance practices are more valuable than their similar peers while the volume of sustainable investments nearly doubled from  to  almost all that investment came from americas wealthiest individuals and institutions in strategic partnership with ubs asset management the aspiration redwood fund offers everyday consumers seeking out companies with good reputations access to sustainable strategies that previously may have been out of reach its pay what is fair business model

whatever you want for its service libby kane nov    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print ceo and founder andrei cherny isnt worried clients wont pay aspiration aspiration an online investment firm that launched tuesday has a radical idea unlike traditional investment firms which charge a percentage of the assets invested the company plans to go in another direction pay whatever you think is fair our fee structure is very revolutionary explains ceo and founder andrei cherny it empowers customers to make that decision and gives them the ability to decide whether or not were doing a good job for them and whether or not our values are aligned he points out that in most investment firms the people managing your money get paid the same amount whether or not they do a good job and that hinging the companys livelihood on pleasing customers provides an incentive to serve them well cherny who has a long history in financial regulation ranging from a position as a financial fraud prosecutor to working with senator elizabeth warren fighting for the establishment of the consumer financial protection bureau built his investment firm for middleclass investors who he says are underserved in the current market were bringing forth a wide range of investment products and investments geared toward the needs of the middleclass investor he explains look at the customer base of hedge funds and private equity shops they serve a clientele thats mostly multimillionaires and large institutions everyone else is buying stocks and mutual funds doing it on their own aspiration is so committed to serving the middleclass investor that it has imposed not only the usual minimum investment requirements on its clients in this case an unusually low  but also a maximum investment  per customer per fund cherny says the cap is to keep the company focused on the underserved investor if you have a fund where some people pay  and a handful put in  million youre almost naturally focused more on that type of customer with the investment cap aspiration aims to limit that sort of bias on the aspiration site you can manage your investments and charitable contributions aspiration aspiration — whose motto is do well do good — is also focused on giving back to the community through its dimes worth of difference campaign it donates  cents of every dollar of revenue to provide microloans to struggling americans additionally users are encouraged to give the amount of their choosing to the charity of their choice on the websites dashboard its the toms and warby parker approach to charitable giving explains cherny but instead of shoe for shoe its economic opportunity for economic opportunity the homepage of aspiration is different than the sites of more traditional investment firms aspiration cherny isnt worried that his clients will refuse to pay a lot of behavioral psychology over the past  or so years shows that people have a strong sense of moral obligation and reciprocity he explains thats as powerful or more powerful than locking people into a legal contract if were not delivering the products we said we would or living up to the values we set up for ourselves they have the ability to not pay us aspiration is not the only company to use a paywhatyouwant strategy but its the first financial company weve come across some retailers have had success with the model — a north carolina diner initially tripled its revenues when it asked customers to pay what god wants — but theres little evidence its sustainable or that users trying to make the most of their money would choose to fork over fees however cherny isnt alone in his confidence the company which has spent a little over a year getting ready for launch has raised over  million in funding and counts ebay founding president jeff skoll as a member of its board of advisors aspirations radical approach to its customers fees relies on a trustbased model consistent in spirit with an approach that i saw drive ebays early success skoll said in a press release its a bold bet and one that i believe will shake up a financial industry that could use some positive disruption aspiration is now in
