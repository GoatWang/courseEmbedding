extensive fixed income style box  important morningstar information the morningstar ratingtm for funds or star rating is calculated for funds with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the morningstar rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics ratings may vary by share class ratings andor rankings may be based in part on the performance of a predecessor fund or share class and are calculated by morningstar using a methodology that differs from that used by janus henderson methodology differences may have a material effect on the return and therefore the ratingranking when an expense waiver is in effect it may have a material effect on the total return or yield and therefore the ranking andor rating for the period the morningstar equity style box™ reveals a funds investment strategy for equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth the morningstar fixedincome style box™ reveals a funds investment style as of the date noted for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar accepts credit ratings reported by fund companies that have been issued by all nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros for a list of all nrsros please visit httpswwwsecgovocrratingagencyhtml additionally morningstar accepts foreign credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies if two rating organizationsagencies have rated a security fund companies are to report the lower rating if three or more organizationsagencies have rated a security fund companies are to report the median rating and in cases where there are more than two organizationagency ratings and a median rating does not exist fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings please note morningstar inc is not itself a nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund a nrsro or rating agency ratings can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive the morningstar analyst rating is not a credit or risk rating it is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of morningstar inc morningstar evaluates funds based on five key unequally weighted pillars which are process performance people parent and price morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a riskadjusted basis analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research but the assessment of each pillar and how they are combined is driven by the analyst’s overall assessment and overseen by morningstar’s analyst rating committee the approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across morningstar’s global coverage universe the analyst rating scale ranges from gold to negative with gold being the highest rating and negative being the lowest rating a fund with a “gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction a fund with a ‘silver’ rating has notable advantages across several but perhaps not all of the five pillarsstrengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction a “bronze” rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating a fund with a “neutral” rating isnt seriously flawed across the five pillars nor does it distinguish itself very positively a “negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers analyst ratings are reevaluated every  months for more detailed information about morningstar’s analyst rating including its methodology please go to httpcorporatemorningstarcomusdocumentsmethodologydocumentsanalystratingforfundsmethodologypdf the morningstar analyst rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund morningstar analyst ratings are based on morningstar’s current expectations about future events therefore in no way does morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such morningstar analyst ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause morningstar’s expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected   morningstar inc all rights reserved the information contained herein  is proprietary to morningstar and its

infooverview product literature distributions summary pricing performance   multisector income portfolio series  the multisector income portfolio offers investors the potential for a lowerrisk total return alternative to investing solely in stocks to accomplish this the portfolio invests in high dividendpaying equity securities diversified among common stocks canadian energy stocks and real estate investment trusts reits as well as in closedend funds cefs which invest primarily in master limited partnerships mlps equities and taxable bonds the portfolio is approximately weighted based on the allocation below canadian energy stocks the canadian energy common stocks held in the portfolio generate cash flow through the gathering processing transportation storage and distribution of oil and natural gas with continuing geopolitical and longterm supply concerns we believe this investment may represent an attractive alternative for investors seeking oil and gas exposure and high current income potential the importance of dividends due to the fact that corporations are not obligated to share their earnings with stockholders dividends may be viewed as a sign of a companys profitability as well as managements assessment of the future in our opinion dividends have had a significant impact on stock performance consider the historical effect dividends have had on companies in the sp  index according to ibbotson associates dividends have provided approximately  of the  average annual total return on the sp  index from  through  the sp  index is an unmanaged index of  stocks used to measure largecap us stock market performance the index cannot be purchased directly by investors you should be aware that there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities included in the portfolio will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will either remain at current levels or increase over time master limited partnerships mlps are limited partnerships that are publicly traded on a us securities exchange which combine the tradeability of common stocks with the corporate structure of a limited partnership mlps are traditionally high cash flow businesses that pay out a majority of that cash to investors unlike individual partnership investments investing in mlps through closedend funds provides investors with one form  per shareholder at the end of the year rather than multiple ks and potential state filings real estate investment trusts in investing low correlation signifies that different investments have not performed in the same way a study by ibbotson associates found that reits low correlation to other investments is a key factor for portfolio diversification this makes a compelling case for the use of reits to reduce risks in a variety of investment portfolios  nareit portfolio objectives this unit investment trust seeks a high rate of current monthly income and capital appreciation there is however no assurance that the objectives will be achieved although this portfolio terminates in approximately  months the strategy is longterm investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios if available there may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an ira or other qualified plan not fdic insured  not bank guaranteed  may lose value you should consider the portfolios investment objectives risks and charges and expenses carefully before investing contact your financial advisor or call first trust portfolios lp at  to request a prospectus which contains this and other information about the portfolio read it carefully before you invest risk considerations an investment in this unmanaged unit investment trust should be made with an understanding of the risks involved with an investment in a portfolio of common stocks and closedend funds common stocks are subject to certain risks such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the funds investment objective and to manage the funds portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding the funds or their underlying investments change unlike openend funds which trade at prices based on a current determination of the funds net asset value closedend funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market certain closedend funds may employ the use of leverage which increases the volatility of such funds certain of the closedend funds invest in mlps investments in mlps are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors including commodity pricing risk supply and demand risk depletion risk and exploration risk us taxing authorities could challenge the trusts treatment of the mlps for federal income tax purposes these tax risks could have a negative impact on the aftertax income available for distribution by the mlps andor the value of the trusts investments an investment in a portfolio containing reit securities is subject to additional risks as companies involved in the real estate industry are subject to changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession the companies engaged in the energy sector are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments falling oil and gas prices may negatively impact the profitability and business prospects of certain energy companies certain of the common stocks held by the trust are issued by companies headquartered in canada which involves additional risks the canadian market is relatively concentrated in issuers involved in the production and distribution of natural resources and continued demands by the province of quebec for sovereignty could significantly affect the canadian market particularly if such demands are met an investment in a portfolio containing securities of foreign issuers is subject to certain risks including currency and interest rate fluctuations nationalization or other adverse political or economic developments lack of liquidity of certain foreign markets withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers risks associated with investing in foreign securities may be more pronounced in emerging markets where the securities markets are substantially smaller less developed less liquid less regulated and more volatile than the us and developed foreign markets certain of the closedend funds invest in highyield securities or “junk” bonds investing in highyield securities should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such securities highyield securities are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates economic recession deterioration of the junk bond market possible downgrades and defaults of interest andor principal highyield security prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities and are affected by shortterm credit developments to a greater degree an investment in a portfolio containing smallcap and midcap companies is subject to additional risks as the share prices of smallcap companies and certain midcap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies due to several factors including limited trading volumes products financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information it is important to note that an investment can be made in the underlying funds directly rather than through the trust these direct investments can be made without paying the trust’s sales charge operating expenses and organizational costs the value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers for a discussion of additional risks of investing in the trust see the “risk factors” section of the

riskinvesting in foreign andor emerging market securities involves risks relating to interest rates currency exchange rates economic and political conditions when interest rates rise the prices of fixedincome securities in the fund will generally fall conversely when interest rates fall the prices of fixedincome securities in the fund will generally rise investments in the fund are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of issuers of underlying securities and their inability to meet their debt obligations investments in high yield or lowerrated securities are subject to greaterthanaverage price volatility illiquidity and possibility of default prepayment risk is the chance that an issuer may exercise its right to prepay its security if falling interest rates prompt the issuer to do so forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates the fund would experience a decline in income and lose the opportunity for additional price appreciation the portfolio may invest in mortgagebacked securities which during times of fluctuating interest rates may increase or decrease more than other fixedincome securities mortgagebacked securities are also subject to prepayments the securities issued by us government sponsored entities ie fnma freddie mac are neither guaranteed nor issued by the us government floating rate loans and similar instruments may be illiquid or less liquid than other instruments and the value of any collateral can decline or be insufficient to meet the issuers obligations the value of municipal securities can be adversely affected by changes in financial condition of municipal issuers lower revenues and regulatory and political developments the fund is subject to currency risk meaning that the fund could experience losses based on changes in the exchange rate between nonus currencies and the us dollar the fund may use derivatives such as options futures inverse floating rate obligations swaps and others which can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on fund performance derivatives may have a leveraging effect on the fund these risks may increase share price

every asset class across global markets posted a positive return for the month equities credit oil and other commodities and interest rates generally gained during the month in the us economic readings remained strong enough to generate more hawkish rhetoric from federal reserve officials in europe economic data also remained positive although upcoming elections and greeces financial position generated a cautious backdrop monetary policy changes and global politics drove volatility in march yet most major asset classes finished nearly unchanged for the month amid investor uncertainty in the us the federal open market committee fomc hiked rates for the second time i n three months citing a strengthening labor market elsewhere the republican healthcare plan failed to garner enough support in the house of representatives and was ultimately pulled at the end of the month as republicans quickly pivoted to tax refor m investors seemed skeptical congress would have the

program i am curious because you only have requirements for my first name and email thank you reply september   at  pm matt admin hi dave yes we do ship out the hard copies of the books and dvds we also send digital copies as well right away we use email to confirm that we only ship one per household and that is why we ask for first name and email the next page verifies shipping details reply september   at  pm lita mckay i am a christian but i am skeptical – you guys sound genuine but nothing is free please expound on what it is you’re selling and the angle once you reply i will have a look reply september   at  pm matt admin hi lita thank you for your comments i have also emailed you a little bit more about us but i’ll try to provide some clarity here for you and the others here is a quote from above – yes we do have a special mentoring program available it costs some money but to go through it you must have your family’s permission and pass a detailed application we do provide free training as well to many people since  people have asked us for training we have two types of training available –free training  our paid mentoring program over the years we have sent out many books and dvds  free of charge and helped many people get started with this idea they received the resources for free and never paid us a penny we are able to send these out for free and still make a profit on the training program because some of the people who receive our resources ask us to mentor them there is nothing for sale on our website without an application because we are limited in the number of people we can provide mentoring to that is the reason for the online application and why there is no pricing on our website hopefully that helps reply september   at  pm lita mckay matt thank you for your reply and personal email i am sorry for my rude comment before i took the dive and requested the resources it makes more sense now that you have shared there are just so many of these crazy scams out there now i like what i see and i have registered for the free classes at the end of october i pray god’s blessing on you and your family and those two cute kids of yours reply september   at  am kyle and andrea is it me or are there others who are not getting a confirmation email it says that the confirmation email was sent to verify i am a real human but i do not see the email just curious reply september   at  pm matt admin hi kyle and andrea you guys are using gmail – and unfortunately you’re getting the email and just don’t realize it check promotions and then drag it from promotions to your inbox and you’ll be all set the confirmation goes out immediately guys and you’ll get an email to verify your shipping so please add us to your address book or drag us to your inbox from gmail sorry for any delay reply september   at  am matt admin we keep receiving many of the same questionscomments over the last few days so i’ll go ahead and address them as well as a few others about faith – we’ve got some hateful and genuine questions about our faith and if we are really christians a couple comments as well about how we’re “fleecing the flock” guys – the book and dvd are free of charge and we pay for shipping secondly we provide a ton of free training online i could go on but if giving away something that helps people makes us “sinners” then we’re guilty as charged yes we are targeting believers for this business because of our vision to help the local church and nonprofit organizations various questions – yes we’ll ship everything to you within  days but you must request the dvd and book through the form above the business model serves businesses and nonprofit organizations we encourage your consultants to charge businesses but serve nonprofits for free yes we have references testimonials and more importantly a spotless reputation online with our students and clients yes we do make money if someone buys something yes we do tithe to our local church yes we have provided mentoring for free to many people yes we have served in ministry in the past and still do no you should not buy something from me because i am a christian no god probably didn’t send you here by divine appointment you are probably here because you spend too much time on social media – lol yes we do have some free training available no we don’t reply to or publish rude comments yes everything is explained in our free book and dvd yes there are limited quantities we ship out each year lastly and best of all… i am sorry but there is nothing i can do to prove my salvation on a website that one made me laugh out loud i almost replied to the comment with christian lingo but i opted to just delete it thank you emails – many thanks to our friends who have reviewed our information and sent us thank you emails and words of encouragement we greatly appreciate you all and are humbled by god’s grace on our lives our prayer is that you will be encouraged by our story again thank you all reply september   at  pm matthew johnson dear matt  sarah i have a question i confirmed my email and was able to access the private area online thank you for sharing the free resources my wife and i spent a few moments reviewing the material online but we do not see any pricing information i feel like i would be a good fit for this but i don’t see the cost associated with the business can you please expound on this as we don’t want to waste your time i did sign up for the free class in october as well reply september   at  pm matt admin hi matthew i received your comment and email message yesterday as well your email message referenced the scholarship program as well as the costs so i’ll answer both of those questions for you yes there is a scholarship program available which makes the lower mentoring program very affordable so there is free mentoring the scholarship and licensing the reason there is no pricing anywhere on the site is that we don’t offer special mentoring without a passing application programs are based upon the applicant once you submit your application you can view the options available for your situation we feel like this is the best and most honorable approach reply september   at  pm sarah admin important notice– we are receiving a lot of comments right now and many of you are posting your email address and shipping addresses in the comment section if you want the resources mailed to you please go through the correct channels and request your book and dvd here please request through this system as that is how we confirm your shipping address and mail out the packages thank you in advance for your cooperation we truly appreciate all of you reply september   at  am antoine i filled in the info for the dvd and book but didn’t see the bonus audio program i had to go back to share the website of fb to get an instant download i wanted you to know that you didn’t send me the program when i requested the book just so you know thx for doing this for the peeps of god reply september   at  pm matt admin thanks antoine we’ve added the mp program to go out by email a few minutes after you request our resources i checked and saw you got the email but i published your comment and answered the question for the sake of everyone else so for clarity we added the bonus mp program to an email that comes shortly after you optin social shares is instant download either way we appreciate you all thanks for all the amazing emails we’re receiving reply september   at  pm laurna adevino dear matt and sarah i wanted to write in and say thank you so much for putting this business model and training together i am very excited and interested and will be scheduling a call with you as soon i have a couple of questions for you guys a can i run this solo as my husband isn’t an entrepreneur b can i run this part time or does it have to be full time c how much can i make my first year – realistically both part time vs full time d how do you charge nonprofits for your services do you give a discount respectfully laurna palm beach fl reply september   at  pm sarah admin hi laurna thanks for your questions i’m emailing you and publishing the comments because your questions are good a every family has one entrepreneur matt is our entrepreneur i am not we still work together i am part time but many people work on their own it just depends on your situation b full time people make more money and learn faster we encourage that but there is an exception to every rule we have had several part timers do very well with this business c i asked matt and he said that there is a wide variation based upon effort skill training etc our revenues were k first year k second year and k rd year we have balanced all of the business based upon our training program as well some trainees have made more and others less it just depends i guess i’m sorry i can be more detailed d matt has never charged a nonprofit in fact he is helping a new church on thursday when you are profitable and successful our prayer is that you’ll share and help the local nonprofits for free we pray that is helpful to you sarah reply september   at  pm miguel desoto i just wanted to come back and say thank you we received our package in the mail today and the kids wanted to open it lol it was like christmas in san antonio love the wrapping paper job and i wanted to tell you it worked you replied to my email already but we laughed so hard at the wrapping paper i had to tell you you guys rock for jesus reply september   at  pm sarah admin hi miguel thanks for your reply you know what is funny is that this was matt’s idea and the first time we shipped the packages out i had to take them to the post office i had two or three boxes like the picture below and i had people actually asking me if they could have one not knowing there was just a book and dvd inside matt said that if the people were asking for them then it must be a good envelope reply september   at  am richard kneider i am interested in getting information about what you are offering so my wife and myself can continue to serve others reply september   at  pm sarah admin hi richard just a reminder to get request the dvd and book please use the request form here your shipping addresses are printed on a label machine and thus the system will add you to the database we appreciate all the awesome stories and emails 🙂 reply september   at  pm gina and rj morgan dear matt and sarah thank you for putting this together i have been involved in many start up business ideas through the years i have also seen dozens of business models and i have to say that this is the most organized and one of the best ideas i have seen in a very long time i wanted to let you know that we received our package in the mail on saturday and really love what you’re doing we also love the vision is to help empower believers and help nonprofits we

encouragement we’re excited about what we’re seeing happen with the community i saw your registration and application come through and look forward to getting to know you guys many blessings and thanks again reply october   at  pm matt admin here’s a few other questions i’ve received – yes this business is virtual and can be run from any location in the world with internet and phone access it is not limited to the usa yes the book and dvd is an outline of our model and is training for the program yes there is free training provided the next class is in october no you don’t need to buy anything from us to learn this business and you’ll see there is no option for purchasing anything in the private area it will take about  days to get your book and dvd yes we ship real books and dvds but you’ll get access to digital versions as well yes some information is kept private on this website due to customer confidentiality agreements that i have we don’t publish our phone number on this website because we were getting too many calls asking us to explain the business our phone numbers business information and more proof case studies and testimonials are all published inside of the private area and other other websites which you’ll learn about when you request the book and dvd  of your questions will be answered with the book and dvd reply december   at  pm chloe knudsen dear matt and sarah i am a nurse and was seriously injured in an automobile accident and am now unable to be hired for a nursing position all they see when i go to an interview is my limp and my cane i have been praying that god would send me a way to make some income online as well as help other people too although i cannot work directly as a nurse my goal is to help others i have been duped with other work from home scams so i pray that you are offering a legitimate way of earning an income that is legal and honest thank you and god bless chloe knudsen bsn rn cpn reply december   at  pm matt admin thanks chloe you will see that we don’t offer mentoring or allow anyone to spend money unless they pass a detailed application all business information is offered for free inside of the private area if you’re a good fit you’re welcome to apply for mentoring we said a prayer for you today chloe hang in there 🙂 reply december   at  am ray mills hello matt my name is ray and i too have a desire to start a home based business i am a born again christian of many years and am as skeptical as the next i have been looking for a “work from home opportunity” many years and have tried a number of ventures i keep saying the same thing over and over there must be a legitimate opportunity on the net but can’t find one i hope and pray yours is the one sincerely ray mills reply january   at  pm brian mart you are very careful not to reveal any detail about your so called offer  of online offer are scams or pyrimid offers or whatever send me an email and tell me what you are trying so hard to hide… and i will reuest your book and video thanks brian reply january   at  pm matt admin brian if you don’t want the book and dvd then you don’t have to request it someone else will while it is tempting to get defensive about what we are doing and the why… people can be their own judge if you want the book and dvd then request it if not no problem there are several reasons we don’t share everything on this website including customer privacy however that will make sense if you request our book and dvd sarah and i gives these away for free and we’re not forcing anyone here reply

hello matt and sarah…i have been checking online for added income and was glad to see your info for christians as i have left this journey up to god in my prayers i have read all the info and other comments so that i don’t waste your money and time will you answer the following for me even though i know that it will be in the info that you will be sending out does this involve working with people and businesses and churches the reason that i ask this is that we live in a very small town of less than  people and  to  hours from larger towns thank you and god bless your efforts joann reply february   at  pm matt admin hey joan yes it is included in the resources but it does involve working with people businesses churches etc we are consultants and that is all covered in the bookdvd you do not have to work with only local businesses i have worked with clients in seattle and the uk it is virtual of course so don’t worry about the small town reply february   at  pm carl hi matt and sarah i just went thru the steps on ordering my dvd and books great praise the lord there are still good christians doing the right thing helping others i can’t believe some of the comments about one inperticular that stated that nothing is for free my sister suppose to be a christian to and she says the same thing but what they don’t realize things coming from god’s work is free thank you both i am a disable evangelist i have to use a walking cane and doctors says i can’t work but god says he has work for me on the internet and i believe that is why i came across your website is because god directed me to it may god bless you both reply february   at  pm matt admin thanks carl 🙂 people can be critical… but if i stay caught up with what everyone thinks i would not be able to do what we’re doing everyone is skeptical i guess part of the territory some will request the book and dvd some won’t it doesn’t really matter to us we’re praying for the right people thx again for the comment reply march   at  pm matt admin yes we’re still offering the free resources in  we ship packages out about once per week thanks reply march   at  pm jerry i am a believer but i have been
