success the greek sex and the city joannie danielides to receive prestigious matrix award acquisition king c dean metropoulos  and sons c dean metropoulos is among the grand marshals of this year’s greek independence day parade in new york city and a classic ragstoriches story of an immigrant son who made good by dimitri c michalakis “i’m in the acquisition business” says c dean metropoulos simply “and i love it i love finding opportunities negotiating the deals repositioning the businesses many of which are troubled though many are not even with healthy companies you can still find wonderful ways to make them grow organically or via strategic addon acquisitions there are many opportunities out there that need energy focused handson management and financial expertise” and in  years of dealmaking the majority in consumer product companies “i like basic industries that i can understand and i can contribute to” metropoulos has earned a sterling reputation in the private equity investment world he’s made over  “acquisitions” over those years involving  billion of invested capital the morningstar group was acquired for  billion in  international home foods for close to  billion in  and taken public and hillsdown holdings for  billion that same year in  his greenwich connecticutbased cdm group acquired pinnacle foods which owns a bundle of venerable brands such as aunt jemima duncan hines log cabin swanson frozen dinners armour canned meats lender’s bagels celeste pizza mrs paul’s seafood and van de kamp’s among others pinnacle was sold to blackstone in  “if we’re proud of anything it’s that no one has ever lost money with us” says the yearold acquisitions maven who says he’s generated an average  return for himself and his various banking and financial partners “no one has ever been disappointed you can talk to jp morgan goldman sachs morgan stanley lehman or bank of america and the feedback will be one of consistent respect integrity and performance is how they define cdm  co our integrity is everything i always say that to the boys and their mother reinforces it stronger than i do” his wife of  years is marianne now producing a movie and a founder of the “campaign to end childhood hunger” and paul newman’s “hole in the wall gang” cancer camps and the boys are his sons evan  and daren  who have been principals in his various enterprises since they were barely old enough to peer over the conference table at their father’s various companies “my two sons have tremendous creative ideas on how to resurrect iconic brands that have been around for a very long time but have lost their competitive appeal” says their father proudly “they bring fresh guerillamarketing ideas and outsidethebox thinking they push me harder than i’d like to be pushed but they challenge me and often change my views” evan graduated high school at  and was the youngest ma intern at deutsche bank’s london office and together with his brother was advising his father right from the start metropoulos loves to tell stories about their business prescience and what he calls their “wonderful virgin views and perceptions” “chef boyardee was a wonderful  million iconic brand which they helped me recreate” he recounts with relish “my wife marianne and i were driving up to boston from greenwich and the boys were  and  years old at the time while on route  they saw a wwf billboard on the side of the road and one of my sons says ‘dad is that wwf’ i wasn’t sure but when we get back to the office on monday evan takes one of my senior vps of marketing a professional who makes a couple of million dollars a year and he says to him ‘let’s go visit wwf’ so they go down to wwf headquarters and my son tells the receptionist there ‘i’d like to see vince mcmahon we own a company called international home foods which includes things like chef boyardee and we want to do a deal with him’ now remember international home foods at the time was a  billion dollar business and vince mcmahon the owner of wwf is a very commercial animal” mcmahon’s wife linda president of wwf came out to the talk to the youngest business executive and he convinced her to strike a deal with international home foods “dad” evan told his father later “this is a perfect demographic for this product all these people who watch wwf they’re great consumers for chef” “so” his father concludes “we got into this very financiallyattractive relationship where wwf would market our product and also shoot our ads american home products which had previously owned the brand would spend  million shooting product ads but with wwf which has an inhouse production company we spent barely  and we got to use people like the rock cold stone mankind and get featured at all their internationally televised events that was a phenomenal thing” another phenomenal thing he hurries to relate was the gulden’s mustard deal with jennifer aniston proposed by the boys “evan had gone to the ionian village in greece and there he met jennifer aniston’s cousin from philadelphia” metropoulos tells the story “and jennifer and kevin bacon were shooting a movie called picture perfect in the movie jennifer plays a young advertising executive coming out of graduate school working for kevin bacon and trying to sell him on how she was going to put a big campaign behind a brand my son read this and through the aniston cousin he met at the ionian village he got in touch with jennifer aniston’s agent and we got the name of gulden’s mustard in that movie for nothing as the brand that jennifer was pushing on kevin bacon it became part of the plot fortythree minutes of that movie featured gulden’s mustard you can’t buy that kind of advertising” then there was the boys’ coup with bumble bee tuna which their father had acquired and which evan headed as president at  and daren at —“that’s a  million company” their father exclaims “and one day my wife was driving up to the greenwich school here and the boys were listening to the radio talk show host howard stern” he tells that story “and howard mentioned somewhere in these wisecracks that his mother never fed him so he’d always come home and open up a can of bumble bee tuna and that was his favorite meal when evan heard that he comes home from school and he calls the station and he says ‘my name is evan metropoulos i’m the president of bumble bee tuna’—he didn’t tell him how old he was—‘and i’d like to come and talk to you about advertising the brand on the show’ so evan goes with his brother daren plus two of our attorneys and when they get there the boys were  and  and they sit in a conference room and they make a deal to advertise bumble bee tuna on howard stern and it was a very attractive deal and howard would pitch it all the time and the boys became his favorite guests but i told them ‘boys you let him suck you into sexual stuff and i’m going to pull the plug” then there’s the story of how their father acquired perrier jouet champagne and the boys made it the cool and “in” champagne for the young affluent market by having their friends in the entertainment industry feature it in their videos and concerts “snoop dog limp bizkit all of them the boys would donate the champagne and when these guys did their concerts and videos they would open up our champagne in fact it was even worked into some of their lyrics and it became a very hot little brand” metropoulos is justifiably proud of his sons’ business prowess and loves to talk about it but then again he was no slouch himself as a business wunderkind born in greece he came to america at nine when his father came looking for a better future for his children “and he made a very great sacrifice like many immigrants before them my parents both worked very very hard and i pause at least once a day because i lead a good life and i say none of this would be possible if it wasn’t for the tremendous sacrifices by my mom and dad katerina and jimmy they are blessed people” the family lived in watertown massachusetts where jimmy metropoulos worked at the star market and later owned a restaurant in newton called cabot metropoulos went to college on a scholarship and after graduate school at babson and a yearandahalf towards his doctorate at columbia he went to work for gte “i worked for this wonderful company called gte which is now verizon and i was  years old and i lived in europe paris hong kong geneva and london and in my s i was running the international business as the youngest senior vp in the company’s history and i loved it” he rhapsodizes still “we had joint ventures in argentina mexico india japan and operated in  different countries and i fell into a situation on my first deal where i bought a very small business in europe and it turned out to be very successful and it got me into the acquisition business” that first acquisition was a company based in italy and belgium that manufactured space heaters and air conditioners and he says “i bought that business with all the money i ever had plus i sold this beautiful factory which was worth about  million to a real estate family in italy i sold it for  so i could use the money to buy the company” the price tag of that first acquisition was  million and for a time the young executive had his hands full trying to keep up the cash flow and the company solvent until one day he was flying back to the states for a greek wedding and he happened to sit next to a honeywell executive in charge of the company’s joint ventures in europe “and i said to him who makes all the frames for honeywell and he said we subcontract most of that stuff out and i said gee i have a wonderful company that can do that for you and he said well next time you go back over there i’ll introduce you to my colleagues and i’ll suggest to them that they give you guys a trial i said i’m taking the flight right back he said you’re gonna go back i thought you were going to a wedding i said no i’m going right back and i apologized to the groom and the bride and i flew back and got the order from this guy and it became a big part of our business” c dean metropoulos  co has grown considerably since then and the deals now average in the billions and multibillions but at  metropoulos says he still has the same zest for the deal and still looks for the opportunity “to grow a company” which he always did “and if i think that i bring something to that equation of growing it financially and successfully then i go for it if i don’t think i bring something to that equation i avoid it” and of course now his sons are part of the equation and the partnership works both ways “i respect them because they do push me harder than i’ve ever been pushed” he admits “they’re very bright and very creative but i tell them to root all their decisions on business fundamentals and have integrity and compassion above all and we all agree if you don’t enjoy what you’re doing don’t do it we all love what we’re doing and we love working with each other” sponsored links home  about neo magazine  neocorp media c dean metropoulos  co private

harwell october   follow drewharwell when pabst brewing the lowbrow beer house behind old milwaukee and colt  went on the market in  few expected its new buyer would have the industrialist poise or presidential hairline of billionaire dealmaker c dean metropoulos the yearold investor was one of america’s richest men a star of the privateequity world prone to highminded disquisitions on global sustainability pabst was the musty divebar maker of some of the cheapest beers ever canned but under metropoulos’s control the yearold brewer continued its streak of remarkable growth sales climbed  percent in three years to  million liters of beer a year then last month metropoulos surprised again he would sell pabst four years after buying for nearly  million in profit metropoulos had done it again the veteran turnaround artist has built his livelihood on scooping up crestfallen brands and preparing them for new success — or at least a profitable resale by those conquests he has accrued a net worth of  billion dubbed “mr shelf space” for his dominance of the lucrative american grocery aisles he has over three decades revived brands as distinct as bumble bee duncan hines vlasic ghirardelli hungryman and chef boyardee his masterstroke as the savior who last year rescued twinkies from the trash bin of history beverage information group yet metropoulos’s pabst deal was different in one important way to lead the beer giant he tapped his sons who unlike their decorous father were known largely for their fasttalking partyboy gloss daren  who bought an  million mansion from hugh hefner and evan  who a decade ago told a new york times reporter “i’ve been with more chicks than any fat guy you know except pavarotti” even before they unveiled any changes for the vintage brewery the family’s legacy had some pabst diehards on edge the brothers san francisco blogger zach perkins wrote in  “are about as far from both hipster and blue collar the demographics that keep pbr profitable as they could possibly be” now as metropoulos and his sons close their latest turnaround many in the beer world have wondered how did they pull it off and what quarry are they eyeing next neither dean metropoulos nor his sons would talk extensively with the washington post before the closing of the pabst deal planned for early november the metropoulos playbook for all its success is deceptively simple buy a wellknown brand that has as dean told leaders magazine lost its “mojo” reenergize it with new packaging maybe or a highprofile ad campaign sell the newly hyped brand for a handsome profit repeat the strategy works metropoulos says because he can think more creatively and devote more attention to a brand’s future than its overextended conglomerate owners could “we move quickly” dean told time magazine last year “we don’t like to be slowed down with analytics or bureaucracy” a farmer’s son who emigrated from greece at age  metropoulos made his first corporate deal in his s buying a european maker of space heaters and air conditioners with as he told greek american magazine neo “all the money i ever had” he later made a series of profitable acquisitions for a vermont specialtycheese company megainvestor c dean metropoulos made billions reviving stale brands then his partyloving sons joined in handouthandout as his profile grew big investment banks and privateequity giants began trusting him with their money in hopes he’d find the next big thing many of the gold mines were onetime middleamerica favorites largely abandoned on store shelves in  for example he and a dallas buyout firm gathered  billion to buy international home foods the keeper of little lunch staples such as chef boyardee canned pasta and bumble bee tuna four years later they sold it to conagra comfortably doubling their money his targets he told time were mostly nostalgia brands household names that “no matter how badly they’ve been mismanaged cannot be killed over time” so last year he found a match in twinkies teaming up with a privateequity firm and paying more than  million to buy the dessert icon out from hostess brands’ bankruptcy the new owners returned the snack cakes to shelves but they also dramatically changed production lines to enhance efficiencies one yearold bakery in suburban chicago which employed  factory workers was reopened only to close a year later despite that “the sweetest comeback in the history of ever” as twinkies’ marketing called it tapped into a national nostalgia for unapologetic junkfood cravings and appeared to pen a happy ending on a story of big business gone wrong it also canonized metropoulos with a level of public goodwill most billionaire buyout kings could only dream of when metropoulos bought pabst for  million in cash in  it appeared a similar success was afoot the brand boasted its fastgrowing flagship pabst blue ribbon regional favorites lone star in texas national bohemian in baltimore rainier in the pacific northwest and a series of vintage smoky stalwarts colt  old milwaukee schaefer stroh’s schlitz “each one of them has a story” he said in a bloomberg news interview “people yearn to go back to some of our heritage” this time he put his sons in charge metropoulos had been grooming them for years to be heirs to his creative legacy calling them “game changers” for their youthful familiarity with social media and brandbuilding in  when evan metropoulos was featured on mtv’s “true life i’m the youngest tycoon in the world” he bragged of working on multimilliondollar sponsorship deals as a college freshman between commutes to class in his humvee three years later when his father bought a  million luxury hotel called the castle overlooking the hudson river he gave ownership positions to his sons then  and  under the family’s ownership pabst shed its famous resistance to advertising with some offthewall attempts at viral marketing to promote the pacific northwestbased beer olympia it offered  million last year to “anyone who can ensure the safe capture of bigfoot” pabst also tapped big celebrity cameos rapper snoop dogg in a white fur coat promoting a potent fruity “alcopop” blast by colt  actor will ferrell in a series of inscrutable lowbudget old milwaukee ads that aired only in tiny tv markets before taking off online one of those old milwaukee ads which aired in north platte neb during the super bowl proved wildly successful not just for the volume of public chatter it inspired but for its frugality while other companies paid  million for second gameday spots theirs was watched more than  million times on youtube and cost about  sometimes the metropoulos mojo was a little much after he bought pabst metropoulos reportedly told top staffers he wanted to pull old style “chicago’s beer since ” out of a deal as the ballpark beer for wrigley field in order to spend more on promoting old style light according to the chicago tribune when cubs fans revolted the firm changed its mind the takeover of pabst was not universally loved within its headquarters which the brothers moved from its chicago suburb to los angeles near where they lived dozens of pabst employees defected and some top executives spoke bitterly about their new owners who they said belittled and overloaded employees with impulsive oddball ideas “no one at pabst had ever screamed obscenities into the phone before daren and evan    they were trying to manage through fear and aggression” said bryan cook  a pabst field marketing representative who worked there six years before quitting in  “they were something billionaires whose dad had bought them a new toy” if there was tension between the brothers and their father they’ve hidden it well dean metropoulos said his sons “have been critical to me” crediting “their energy and their different way of thinking in connecting with young millennial consumers” the brothers filled social media with photos of celebrities at brand parties and a blog with tributes to “awesome” old pbr ads during a tv interview in a convenience store evan metropoulos shifted a sixpack of pbr in front of a competitor in the cooler case leading his brother to joke “this is how you position the brands” yet their guerrilla marketing did little to help some of pabst’s flagging brands shipments of old milwaukee cases dropped  percent in the two years after will ferrell’s first ads according to the beverage information group an alcoholindustry research firm in  two years after snoop dogg’s endorsement of blast by colt  the drink still sold less than schlitz the brothers also struggled to match their father’s wellhoned public polish at age  daren bought a sprawling manor next to the playboy mansion a palatial home they later staged for snoop dogg’s st birthday party “let’s be honest” evan metropoulos told howard stern last year “i don’t have to work” pabst’s pending sale to a littleknown partnership — including a cyprusbased investor oasis beverages with breweries in russia — led some pabst lovers to worry over a betrayal of the beer’s allamerican roots it also contradicted some of the brothers’ early public wishes for the brand calling pabst “a trophy property    we’ll own for the rest of our lives” they belittled foreign beer ownership during a  interview with bloomberg businessweek evan even imagined berating a noncustomer “shame on you for drinking bud light what the hell are you drinking that for to support some foreigners” so why did the metropoulos family sell short turnarounds are a metropoulos trademark and the potential for a halfbillion dollars in profit probably didn’t hurt pabst’s brands as with american brewers in general also faced rising competition from craft beers spirits and wine “maybe what they decided to do” said adam rogers of the beverage information group “was get out while the getting was good” what’s next the metropoulos family has been open about wanting to buy a pro football team and their names have emerged in talks for the oakland raiders the jacksonville jaguars and this year the buffalo bills dean metropoulos said “other deals are coming along soon enough” but would not hint as to what whatever they are his sons will likely come along for the ride “we make so many acquisitions” metropoulos told an interviewer “it’s easy not to step on each other’s feet”
