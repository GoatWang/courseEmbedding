management investment company it was incorporated in new york on march   and commenced investment operations on may   the fund’s shares of common stock are traded on the nyse american marketplace under the ticker symbol “crf” although the fund’s common stock has frequently traded at a premium to its net asset value during the past several years shares of closedend funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value closedend funds differ from openend management investment companies commonly referred to as mutual funds in that closedend funds do not redeem their shares at the option of the stockholder and generally list their shares for trading on a securities exchange by comparison mutual funds issue securities that are redeemable daily at net asset value at the option of the stockholder and typically engage in a continuous offering of their shares mutual funds are subject to continuous asset inflows and outflows that can complicate portfolio management whereas closedend funds generally can stay more fully invested in securities consistent with the closedend fund’s investment objectives and policies the fund’s investment objective is capital appreciation with current income as a secondary objective there is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objectives in determining which securities to buy for the fund’s portfolio the fund’s investment adviser uses a balanced approach including “value” and “growth” investing by seeking out companies at reasonable prices without regard to sector or industry which demonstrate favorable longterm growth characteristics valuation and growth characteristics may be considered for purposes of selecting potential investment securities the fund may invest without limitation in other closedend investment companies and etfs provided that the fund limits its investment in securities issued by other investment companies so that not more than  of the outstanding voting stock of any one investment company will be owned by the fund as a stockholder in any investment company the fund will bear its ratable share of the investment companys expenses and would remain subject to payment

bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and
