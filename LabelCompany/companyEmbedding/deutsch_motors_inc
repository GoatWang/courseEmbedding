RELIABLE CONNECTIVITY FOR A CONNECTED WORLD



In electric vehicles, high-voltage connectors transmit high-voltage power from the battery to the powertrain or electric motor, while miniature connectors reliably transmit signals. In factories and industrial environments, connectors integrate production across disparate machines – including robots and control cabinets – for seamless connectivity. In commercial aircraft, this device enables critical flows for high-speed internet access, in-flight entertainment technology, and navigation, landing, and flight systems. In intelligent buildings and the connected home, this device integrates communications and security systems, HVAC controls, and power transmission. From our USB and RJ45 connectors, to TE's DEUTSCH and AMP connectors, we manufacture connectivity solutions for a more interconnected world.

NEW TE PRODUCT
Industrial RJ45 jacks, integrated magnetics
This connector is engineered to tolerate continuous operating temperatures up to 85 degrees Celsius. Integrating the magnetics into the jack allows for a much improved EMI noise shielding, enabling more reliable connections and limiting contact corrosion in industrial Ethernet applications.






















NEW TE PRODUCT
KILOVAC LEV100H Contactors
Hermetically sealed, this contactor can withstand the extreme conditions of most battery storage and power distribution systems, with little or no oxidation, even after long periods of non-operation. Among the smallest 150A/1000V contactors in the industry, it has 8kV isolation between open contacts, ideal for high-voltage (HV) isolation.






















NEW TE PRODUCT
SEACON HydraElectric Wet-Mate Connectors
Tested and qualified in accordance with ISO 13628-6 and API 17F - SEAFOM TSD-02, this connector is mateable underwater up to 4000M deep. It operates at 1000VAC / 1500VDC (U) and supports CAT – 5 Ethernet standards to help enable power transmission and high-speed data transfer.
