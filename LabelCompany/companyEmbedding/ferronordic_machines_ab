COMMENTS BY LARS CORNELIUSSON, CEO AND PRESIDENT:


		The Russian economy remains weak. The reduction in the market for new construction equipment seems to have slowed down, but the market during the first six months was anyway 10-15% lower than during the same period last year. We do not expect any material changes in the market situation before the end of the year.

		 Despite of the weak market, we have delivered a relatively strong result for the quarter, including a satisfying cash flow. Even if the revenue was lower than during the second quarter last year, we managed to compensate this primarily by lower costs, resulting in an increased operating profit. Like the last quarter we noted a positive result per ordinary share (which is calculated after dividends on preference shares). Given the difficult market situation, I am very pleased with this result.

		After the end of the quarter, we have also been appointed official distributor for Dressta bulldozers and pipelayers all over Russia. The addition of Dressta bulldozers fits perfectly into our product offering and improves our ability to offer full-package solutions to our customers. This is fully in line with our strategy to use our network to distribute complementary products. We also take over responsibility for the aftermarket of the existing machine fleet.

		 Since the last report we have also refinanced our credit facilities. In total, we now have up to RUB 1,500m of committed financing available from two different banks. Thanks to our net cash position we are not in need of this financing at the moment, but it provides security for the company going forward in these troublesome times.

CHANGES TO VOLVO CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT’S PRODUCT LINE
Thu, Nov 13, 2014 16:29 CET

Stockholm, 13 November 2014


Earlier today the Volvo Group announced that it has decided to discontinue development and production of its current product line of Volvo-branded backhoe loaders and motor graders in Europe and Americas and transfer these operations to its Chinese company SDLG. The target is to ramp down the production of these products by the end of 2015.


Sales of new backhoe loaders and motor graders represent approximately 18% of Ferronordic Machines’ revenue from new machine sales. 


Given that the target is to ramp down production gradually we expect the short-term impact of this decision to be limited. The long-term consequences will be assessed as part of the company’s continuous review of its product portfolio.

COMMENTS BY LARS CORNELIUSSON, CEO AND PRESIDENT:


Although the decrease of the market has been slowing down lately, the total market for new construction machines in Russia during the first nine months was still 7-10% lower than the same period last year. The general uncertainty in the market and lack of financing continue to depress the demand. At the same time, however, we see a pick-up in our customers’ machine utilization. This has a positive effect on our aftermarket sales and should further contribute to the existing pent-up demand to renew the machine population in Russia. 

Despite of the weak market, we managed to deliver a relatively strong result for the quarter with both increased revenue and increased profitability compared to last year. We have continued to sell more of large machines, while at the same time growing sales of parts and service nicely. The earnings per ordinary share
 (
calculated after dividends on preference shares
)

continue to be positive. 
 

At the same time we continue to develop our business by adding complementary products. As mentioned in the Q2 report, 
we 
signed an agreement with LiuGong Dressta Machinery in July under which we became the official distributor for Dressta bulldozers and dozer-based pipelayers all over Russia. In September, we also signed an agreement with Rottne Industri AB under which we will become the official distributor for Rottne forestry machines all over Russia. We are proud of these announcements, which underline the strength of our distribution network. The addition of these products, which fit perfectly into our existing offering of products from Volvo CE and Terex Trucks, is fully in line with our strategy to use the network to distribute complementary products.



Presentation of third quarter report

A presentation of the third quarter report will be held by phone on 24 November 2016 at 9:30 a.m. CET.
