The company was incorporated on 11.04.1985 and is a listed public limited company in BSE. The company is a profit making company since inception and engaged in Automobile business. Presently the company has its presence as a dealer of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. in Delhi, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. In Delhi the company has 5 showrooms and 3 workshops, in Haryana 2 showrooms and a workshop and in Himachal Pradesh 2 showrooms and 2 workshops.
Competent's status is re-affirmed every year at the All India Maruti Dealers' Convention,the company bags maximum number of awards in all categories. Chief among these awards are those for best Sales, Service and Customer Satisfaction. Competent's services have, in the past, consistently won the primary award that really matters to any organisation providing services - The Approval of the Customer. As a testimonial to this, Competent has enjoyed the most repeat customers among Maruti dealers. The company has sold more than 2,50,000 vehicles and the numbers are growing year on year.
Competent owes this to the breadth of the vision of Mr. Raj Chopra, who founded the company. Accurately gauging the temper of the Indian customer, Mr. Raj Chopra decided that nothing less than the very best would do - no matter how much it costs/costed in terms of time, effort and expense. Much before "Total Quality Management" and ISO accreditations became fashionable buzzwords in management circles; Competent Automobiles was more than living up to its name. 
This has enabled the company to fully comply with the stringent norms set by MSIL while other dealers were only gearing up . Competent has been example and trend setter for Maruti Customers.

Free Service
Sir 

this complaint is with regard to free service. I have bought  Breeza ZDI + and today my second free service is due. I have come to competent automobiles at Mandi. They are charging for wheel alingment and wheel balancing. I am surprised when I saked them to justify me about the labour charges which they are charging from cousyomer under free service. The executive as well as their officer have abrupltely replied to me me that agr karwani hai to karwao koi jabrdasti nahin hai. Such kind of reply from the business executives are not expected at all. Moreover the staff is not co operative with the customers no one is able to assist the customers in justified manner. Competent Mandi is providing very bad  infact worse service to the customers.

manufacturing defects in all five JK TYRES
Dear Sir, 

 I am Mayank Sharma resident of harinagar brought a brand new Wagon R LXI Model (DL2C AL 3734) at 28/03/2010 From COMPETENT AUTOMOBILES CO LTD at moti nagar showroom. sir now I m facing some problem in my car so I visited  DD Motors Showroom Mayapuri  They investigate my car and found that my all five tyres are  defected  since manufacturing. So they called and informed me about the defects and need to change immediately and for that u have to gone to Karol bagh for the exchange. 

 when I had a word with the concerned person on DD motors  (Mr.Kamal Deep.) he said that we are going to discuss your problem with(Mr. Mittal) GM of DD motors and JK TYRES and for this I have to left my vehicle  for one day .next day   (Mr. Mandeep) concerned person of jk tyres Visited at DD motor Mayapuri and after checking  they  confirmed me that sir there is  manufacturing defects and they gave me letter of changing tyre and said that I  have to  go to chadha trader (JK Tyres Dealer) Mayapuri they would  change your all five Jk tyres 

as per their instruction I visited over there and I found that all tyres which they r giving to me for exchange are also having the same manufacturing defect .when I again have a word with him they told me that they have the same problem in all jktyres and it was surprised for me .then, I asked him that do you have any more stock for jktyres. they replied me, no sir then I again called Mr.Mandeep and told all this .he said that we have only this stock .if you want to change your tyres you have to wait for 15-20 days so I requested to chadha trader to  give me some other brand of  tyres so that I can drive my car. He agreed on this and replaced my all JKtyres to Apollo tyres and but for that I have to pay 350/- on each tyres. 

  Sir in all this I got very upset and disappointed too with maruti service.  That when I brought a new car why this type of problem occurring. 

  But still now I am facing the same problem in it so I again visited to dd motor. after investigating my car they found no such type of  problem , but when I drive my car at  60 speed I felt that there some kind of  noise come from one of wheel. 

  Now my feedback to maruti service was not to buy a new car from maruti. And I also felt that I brought a second hand wagon r from maruti not a new one. 



All my Queries for you are: 

1 why this kind of problem occurring in all my five tyres. 

2 why should maruti didn’t check this big mistake. 

3 why should the authorized dealer (competent auto mobiles co ltd) give me this defected car to me. 

4. Isnt the PDI responsibility to check the vehicle properly. 

Please advice me what should I have to do with this kind of problem.
