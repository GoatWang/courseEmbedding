        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

UPDATED: 8/30/12 9:46 pm ET -- adds more detail
HONG KONG -- China Baoxin Auto Group Ltd. has agreed to buy NCGA Holdings Ltd., a 12-store luxury dealership group in the country operated by U.S.-based McLarty Automotive Partners.
NCGA will remain a minority partner in the combined company. Baoxin said it paid $305 million for its majority stake.
Mark McLarty, the son of U.S. dealer and former White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, is chairman of NCGA.
The deal would include the dealerships in NCGA’s Yanjun Auto, a luxury-brand chain in northern China.
Baoxin, a China dealer for BMW autos, said the acquisition of NCGA would add eight BMW/Mini dealerships, two Jaguar and Land Rover dealerships, one Porsche and one Volvo dealership to its operations
McLarty Automotive, which is chaired by Mack McLarty, operates two other international companies besides Yanjun, Caltabiano McLarty in Brazil and GDV Imports Mexico. Former Toyota and Chrysler executive Jim Press is president of McLarty’s international dealership operations.
The NCGA acquisition is expected to expand Baoxin’s geographic footprint in China while generating economies of scale and additional capital to continue the company’s growth.
With IPO markets closed and financing options drying up, China’s capital-intensive car dealerships have become targets for investors, including private equity firms.
U.S. fund Warburg Pincus recently invested $200 million for a minority stake in privately owned China Auto Rental Holdings Inc., China’s largest-ever equity financing deal in the car rental industry.
