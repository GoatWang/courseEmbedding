Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions.

"I'd also be shocked if I saw someone like that."
The application of high voltages to animated flesh and bone renders the former translucent and the latter luminescent, allowing the skeleton to be seen in the style of a classic X-ray for as long as the current flows. Stock Femur Bones may be involved and sometimes other funny or unusual things may appear.
Despite the impressive light show, the victim will usually suffer no ill effects beyond looking a bit singed and shocked. On the other hand, a Disintegrator Ray (which is far more likely to be lethal) can also produce these sparks as it zaps the victim to dust (or leaves only the skeleton behind).
The trope name is a tribute to the "X-Ray Specs" that have been advertised in the back of comic books since time immemorial.
While this definitely does not happen in Real Life, the source of this trope is probably the fact that a really high voltage is required in order for an X-Ray machine to produce pictures of your bones.
Not to be confused with taking an X-Ray of a Spark.

Examples:
    open/close all folders  
    Advertising 
 One advertisement for Orangina features a man-in-Orangina-bottle in a giant pinball machine, including X-Ray Sparks at one point.
 A Hostess commercial circa 2001-2002 had Dracula assume bat form and fly at a neon sign for a hotel (mistaking it for a Hostess cupcake), resulting in this.
 This commercial for Wonka ShockTarts.
 At the end of the American commercial for Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, a live-action arm comes in, holding a Game Boy. A bolt of lightning strikes it, and an X-ray of both the arm and the Game Boy flashes by. The Game Boy's internal parts are depicted as being a set of gears and a lightbulb.
 Halfway into the infamous Sega CD commercial, the person being exposed to the Sega CD is briefly seen as a skeleton for a few individual frames.
 This European ident/promo for Cartoon Network involves the Cartoon Network characters zapping one another with a remote that Dexter made, which turns each character into a different CN character, with the character's skeleton being shown as they get zapped. Bloo is even shown to have leg bones.

 Happens to Superman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman in an issue of Aquaman New 52.

    Comic Strips 
 Baby Blues. In one strip Hammie does it to his older sister with static electricity.
 Mother Goose and Grimm: In the July 14th 2012 strip◊ Grimm had this happen to him when he was zapped by a lightning bug.
 When Galactus starts consuming Battleworld during the events of the Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars, limited series, the effects of his machinery absorbing the world cause all the inhabitants, all the heroes included, to succumb to this effect, leaving their skeletons visible. Thankfully, he's stopped before this can be completed.

    Fan Works 
 Super Power Beat Down, episode "The Joker & Harley Quinn vs. Deadpool & Domino": When the Joker shocks Deadpool with his lethal joy buzzer, the Merc with a Mouth's skeleton briefly flashes into sight.

    Films — Animation 
 Happens to several submarine crew workers in Atlantis: The Lost Empire during the scene where the Leviathan starts destroying the submarine they are in.
 Happens in Cats Don't Dance, near the end when Darla hits a machine with a wrench, she flashes many different colors, but her skeleton is seen every couple of frames. Also, during the ending, the turtle shakes hands with Pudge (who is still filled with static electricity from earlier), resulting in this.
 Occurs in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs when Flint attaches a jumper cable to an electrical tower at the power station.
 In the Dragon Hunters CGI movie, when Lian-Chu saves Zoe from electric beasts and returns their lightning attacks with his knitting needles, their skeletons very briefly flash before they're knocked out.

 During the musical number in Eight Crazy Nights in which all of the townsfolk are singing about how badly they treated Whitey over the years, this happened to Whitey when they made him be the TV antenna.
 In Fantastic Mr. Fox, Mr. Fox and Kylie the Opossum climb an electric fence and their skeletons are seen. (Despite being a stop-motion film, this effect is done with 2D animation.) It also happens later to Rat when fighting Fox in the sewer. It doesn't end well.
 Happens to Batty in FernGully 2: The Magical Rescue.

 Happens to the goons in Sleeping Beauty when they're all hit by Maleficent's lightning.
 A variant with the Evil Queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as she is becoming the Witch: she becomes so shriveled and thin that as she holds her hands up to the sky the lightning flash behind them reveals the bones.
 Played with in Winnie-the-Pooh when Eeyore is struck by lighting. Instead of bones, it's his stuffing.
 During the credits sequence to Wreck-It Ralph, Ralph faces Blanka when going into Street Fighter II, but before Ralph can even do anything, Blanka zaps him, revealing the wrecker's gigantic skeleton.
 Happens to Ursula at the end of The Little Mermaid, as a result of King Triton's trident electrocuting her just moments after Prince Eric stabs her with a harpoon.
 Happens with Jafar's death scene in Aladdin: The Return of Jafar. This is censored on the DVD and Blu-Ray version.

    Films — Live-Action 
 The film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York features Marv (Daniel Stern) being shocked; an effects shot briefly replaced him with an actual skeleton puppet wearing the same hair, beard and clothes as him, before turning back to his regular fleshy self in the next scene.
 Star Wars
 Averted with Emperor Palpatine, but not Darth Vader when the latter was carrying the former near the end of Return of the Jedi. The Emperor, caught by surprise, inadvertently sent Force Lightning into himself displaying nothing despite screaming in pain. As Vader conducted the Force Lighting, it displayed Vader's skull inside his head and some of his mechanical implants.
 Pretty much anyone hit by Force Lightning except Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi is subject to this trope. See also Mace Windu in Revenge of the Sith.
 In Young Frankenstein, this trope is used as the monster is brought to life (using lightning). Only (alas) the monster's skull is shown illuminated under his skin.
 In Willow, occurs as Queen Bavmorda is struck by lightning as a result of her own backfiring magic.
 The Mask
 Happens to Stanley Ipkiss in the first movie when he becomes the eponymous Mask for the very first time.
 In one sequel, the dad gets possessed and shoots lightning at the bad guy. He starts to flip around and flash into a skeleton.
 In Son of the Mask, this is the fate of Loki when Odin struck him with lightning to remove his godly powers.
 TRON. Near the end of the film Dumont and the other programs are pinned against a wall as the MCP electronically drains them. As energy pulses through them, their skeletons (and Dumont's skull) can be seen through their bodies.
 Ghostbusters (1984). While the electrical bolts are hitting Dana Barrett and Louis Tulley and turning them into Gozer's demons Zuul and Vinz Clortho, you can see their skeletons inside their bodies.
 Happens in Guardians of the Galaxy, when Gamora is fighting Nebula; Nebula jabs her electrified staff into Gamora, lighting up her skeleton for a few seconds as Gamora screams in agony. A few seconds later it happens as Gamora grabs Nebula's staff, we see a close up of Gamora's skull.
 In the 1953 adaptation of The War of The Worlds a soldier is hit by the Martians' Disintegrator Ray. There's a closeup shot of him as his body glows a bright green, with the skeleton showing through the glow, before the whole thing fades away and the unlucky victim vanishes into nothingness.
 Hot Shots!. Topper Harley walks out of an office into a hallway filled with electrical wires that are giving off sparks.

When the office's door is opened, Harley is whole again but has frazzled hair.

 Occurs from time to time in The New Addams Family.
 Notoriously used in the Made-for-TV Movie The Day After to show those closest to Ground Zero being vaporized. Not only is this appropriate, it's actually pretty close to accurate — or at least, close enough for TV's sake. In Real Life in a nuclear blast, for those closest to Ground Zero, their soft tissues would be vaporized a split-second before their hard tissues (bones) would be. Obviously, no-one has lived to tell the tale of whether or not these twin processes happen fast enough for the eye to see, but both processes happen fast enough for the dead person's shadows to be literally burned into the ground. The effects themselves were realistic, but the special effects department's choice of photographs on which to create the effects made less sense. A few seconds earlier, Kansas City was a scene of panic and rioting; the people shown being vaporized are enjoying a day by the riverside, at weddings, in schools, in bars and coffee shops, etc. Some of the photos used in the vaporization scenes are actually stills from earlier in the movie.
 Super Nova, the second Lexx TV movie, shows Giggerota's skeleton briefly, because the super nova's shockwave dissolved her flesh and clothing a fraction of a second before her bones. It probably wouldn't happen like that in real life, but it looked cool enough that it was used in every version of the show's opening credits.
 Since 1988, the Dalek energy guns on Doctor Who make the victim's body briefly flash lime green while their bones glow bright white. According to dialogue, the victim dies as their internal structures are chaotically rearranged. Earlier it was just a circular area of film around the victim turned negative.
 In Supernatural, when demons are killed within their hosts by specially enchanted blades, their skeletons are briefly visible through the flesh as an internal light flickers.
 The Mickey Mouse Club: This happens to Donald Duck in one of the gong gags at the end of the theme song.

 In the animation used to demonstrate how to use the vigor, when the imp is electrocuted his skull is visible through his head.
 When the vigor is used against opponents their bones show through their bodies.

 The Tesla Cannon in Blood does this to its targets; even the ghost-like Phantasm's skeleton becomes visible!
 BloodRayne: Betrayal:
 If Rayne is struck by Kagan's lightning, her skeleton flashes for the duration of the spell. Also happens when you beat him the first time, he electrocutes her to stun her.

 Occurs in Blood Storm whenever a character is electrocuted by the character Talon.
 Maria from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night will show her skeleton whenever she's electrocuted.
 In Cel Damage, during Fowl Mouth's PSA on digging, one of the many injuries that Flemming gets is this, due to him hitting an electric line with his shovel.
 Crash Bandicoot series:
 Getting killed from an electrocution in Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back or Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped shows the title character's bony corpse and his pink boxers with red hearts.
 A really strange example in the fourth boss fight of Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex with Crunch Bandicoot.

 Returns in Crash Tag Team Racing, where Crash shocks himself in one Die-O-Rama.
 In Creatures Adventures, norns that are struck by lightning show their skeleton briefly. It's completely harmless.
 This happens to characters from Darkstalkers when they are hit by an electric attack, but some don't have a skeleton to show when hit (for example, Pyron shows a constellation, Jedah shows runes, etc.).
 Happens in a boss fight near the end of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!. Just hit K.Rool's flight pack and he'll fall onto the electrified floor.
 In Nexon's game, Dragon Nest, this happens if you or an enemy is affected by the "electrocuted" satus debuff.
 In the first Duke Nukem I, this happens when the title character takes damage from any source.
 Happens to Lil or Laarg in the PS4/PSVita game Escape Plan if either one of them are killed by electricity.
 Happens to any character that hits the electrical sign stage hazard in Eternal Champions.
 This happens to any enemy in Fable III when using the Shock Gauntlets. Killing them with it leaves their corpses as bare skeletons.

 Occurs in both King of the Monsters games.

 LEGO Adaptation Game
 LEGO Batman 2. If Batman gets an electrical shock (e.g. from the Joker) his skeleton can be seen inside his Batsuit.
 LEGO Jurassic World; Owen shocks the Indominus Rex during the Final Battle, causing her to go skeletal while the Raptor Squad and the T. Rex laugh at her.
 Happens in Leisure Suit Larry V when you stick your fingers in an outlet. As they had decided to remove the accidental deaths from the LSL series around this time, it isn't fatal.
 Happens in Little Big Adventure whenever someone is electrocuted.
 LittleBigPlanet
 Touch any electrified material in LittleBigPlanet, and you get the same result. Sackboy lights up, twitches violently for a few seconds, and then explodes. (Don't worry, he comes back normal from the previous Checkpoint after his Critical Existence Failure.) Hilarity Ensues if the electrified object was moving, as Sackboy is stuck in midair during electrocution, and the object may even go right through him. Some people on YouTube have found a way to save the Electrified Sackboy as a costume they can put on whenever they want, making for a very cool, glowing Halloween effect.
 In the sequel, players can see a continued animation, by selecting a Sackbot that has touched an electric material. The Sackbot's head grows so huge that its own eyes pop out of its head and it is thrown into Death Throws. Something very creepy for a childish game.
 In Lollipop Chainsaw, this happens to Juliet if she gets struck by Vikke's lightning bolts in Stage 2. Nick's skull (for those who have not played the game, Nick is a severed head who is Juliet's boyfriend, and is attached to her hip) is also visible as well, and he always makes a funny little remark as he and Juliet are shocked. Oddly enough, these are the only electrical sources that make their skeletal structures visible, being hit by any other electrical source simply makes Juliet fall on her back. You even get a trophy/achievement for being shocked 10 times, and the trophy/achievement icon shows...guess.

 In the Wii game Madworld, when anyone who gets thrown at an electric sign (or other source of electricity), or when the protagonist, Jack, is hit by electricity, their blocky skeletons will be seen. Also, one of the bosses, Rin-Rin, requires you to counter-attack her attacks by kicking her into a video monitor, resulting in this. (It is also possible to throw her into electric signs too, but it's not very easy to do so) Unfortunately, this trope didn't return in Anarchy Reigns (the spin-off of Madworld), so instead the characters flash blue when electrocuted.
 In Magicka, using a eletric component in your spell will shock the enemies and show their animation skeleton.
 Happens in Makai Kingdom when anyone is hit with an electric based attack.
 Metal Gear series:
 In Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, when Volgin shoots lightning at Naked Snake, the screen will instantly flash black and you can see an x-ray of him.
 The North American instruction booklet for Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots has a comic book sequence explaining how to play the game, the functions of each weapon, etc. When demonstrating the Metal Gear Mk. II, the Mk. II tazes a guard, making his skeleton visible.
 Also seen in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, when Strangelove is electrocuting Big Boss during the torture sequence.
 Happens in the Metal Slug series whenever any of the main playable characters gets zapped.
 This usually happens to the Ninja Turtles in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game and the sequel when they're hit by energy weapons or walk into an hazard that emits energy other than fire. (Fire tends to Ash Face them.)
 Mortal Kombat 3:
 Nightwolf's lightning and Stryker's taser fatality will make the foe flash blue, and a skeleton can be seen throughout the lightshow. This was removed in Mortal Kombat Trilogy (an update of the same game).
 When it's time to finish off Cyrax or Sektor, they will short circuit, showing off an x-ray their cybernetic skeleton.
 In Mortal Kombat X, Raiden in the displacer variation can do this to his opponents when they are caught in any of his traps or command grabs. His X-Ray attack in any variation also causes this.
 Happens to the title character in arcade game Nemo.
 Happens to the playable characters in Ninja Baseball Bat Man. Apparently, Beanball Roger and Stick Straw's bats also have bones in them.
 Occurs to any character when they touch an electrical material in The Outfoxies.
 Occurs in Pocket Fighter, also known as Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, to any character who is struck by a lightning cloud.
 Happens to the characters in Po Po Lo Crois, as well as most of the enemies when they are hit by an electric spell.
 In Stage 2 of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Video Game, you frequently run into movie sets that have people in Godzilla and alien costumes. The people in the alien costumes will shoot bolts of electricity at you from their ray guns, resulting in this. The same electrocuted sprite (as well as the burning sprite) is used for all characters, but were made primarily for Scott's body shape and structure, so both sprites will make Stephen Stills look skinny for a second, or Ramona and Kim look flat-chested.
 Happens in Sengoku 3 if you use a lightning technique to any of the enemies. Even to the poor little monkeys.
 Occurs in the first Shock Troopers game. Unfortunately, this was removed in the sequel.
 Happens in the arcade game of The Simpsons. Interestingly, when Marge gets zapped you can see that she has bunny ears hidden in her hair.
 Happens in The Sims 2: Attempting to repair anything without enough Mechanical skill causes you to flash as a bright green skeleton, then wind up with your clothing turned to soot and hair completely frazzled.
 Averted in The Sims 4.
 Occurs in Sly Cooper: Thieves In Time. Go ahead, get hit by a laser or get shot by a gun triggered by stepping into a spotlight. Zap!
 Sonic the Hedgehog series:
 Happens to Knuckles in Sonic and Knuckles when he is counterattacked by Robotnik after trying to reclaim the Master Emerald.
 Predating this, sprites found from a prototype of Sonic CD revealed that Sonic was originally going to get this effect when shocked by the electric wires of Wacky Workbench, but this was scrapped due to policies regarding the image of the company's mascot.
 In Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, going through an electrical current in the Curien Mansion track, Graveyard Gig, will have this happen to you. It also occurs when you drive through the laser grids in Race of AGES, or when Gillius or Metal Sonic attack you with their All-Star attack. Also, Metal Sonic apparently has a skeleton, Sonic and Shadow's quills are part of their skulls while Aiai and Meemee's ears are part of theirs, the Sonic characters have toe bones despite not having toes, Ulala and Pudding have very slim and nice bones, and Wreck-It Ralph, of course, has a gigantic skeleton.
 Street Fighter:
 Street Fighter II has Blanka (pictured above) who can shock his opponent with his power he learned from eels.
 Street Fighter III. Necro, Urien and Ryu each have some sort of electric attack that'll display their opponent's skeleton.
 The return of Blanka in Street Fighter IV also welcomes the return of X-ray sparks. Also the new zippy-zappy mistress C. Viper makes this happen.
 Street Fighter X Tekken features Blanka and Cole from inFAMOUS, who comes from a game all about electric powers.
 This trope can actually reveal some interesting things about some of the characters. In Street Fighter III, Necro, who has stretchy limbs, is shown to have his bones broken into smaller sections like an accordion. Twelve, a non-human Voluntary Shapeshifter, averts the trope entirely. Q, an Ambiguously Human man of mystery, doesn't show his skeleton when shocked, and instead shows his muscular system. In Street Fighter V, Necalli, an ancient Aztec demon, has no visible skeleton, instead just showing a black silhouette when he's shocked. While also likely a bug, when Karin or Chun-Li are electrocuted in their swimsuit costumes, their skeletons can be seen wearing their sunglasses.
 Happens in Streets of Rage.
 Super Mario Bros. series:
 In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, happens all the time to Mario if he gets zapped by any of Luigi's lightning techniques. Can also happen to him too.
 In the Super Mario Strikers intro, a Hammer Bro gets slipped onto an electric fence.
 Also occurs in the sequel Mario Strikers Charged to not only a Birdo and a Pianta in the opening clip, but also to all characters when knocked into the electric fence (Or hit by Dry Bones's Skillshot). However, their skeletons are designed to look realistic. Sweet dreams, kids.
 Happens in the Super Mario Galaxy games when Mario (or Luigi) gets shocked. In the first game, if the shock killed Mario, he would die as just a skeleton, but this was removed in the sequel.
 This was a feature of Pikachu's electrical attacks in the original (and ONLY in the original) Super Smash Bros. Ness (with PK Thunder), Samus (with Charge Beam), and the Ray Gun did the same thing in the original Super Smash Bros., but like Pikachu, they could only do so in the first game. This even provides something of a visual gag if Samus gets shocked, because instead of showing us her skeleton, we just see the human figure inside her power suit. On the other hand, when Kirby and Jigglypuff get hit by electric attacks, only their eyes are visible, implying (sensibly) that they have no skeleton. Funnily enough, Mario and Luigi's noses appear to be part of their skeletons.
 The fan project Super Smash Flash brings this back, granting most characters in its roster a free x-ray when hit with an electrical attack.
 In Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, Yatterman-2's grab attack consists of her electrocuting her opponents with their skeletons (or inner mechanical parts for robots) showing. For some reason this is the only electrical attack that does this.
 The title characters in some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game show this effect when they are zapped by beams from roving robots on wheels.
 In Episode 2 of Touch Detective, the main character (who is a little girl) can suffer from this by fooling around with an electrical socket.
 In Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Ty can inflict this effect on enemies using the Zappyrang.
 In Um Jammer Lammy, if Lammy and/or Parappa starts performing at either the Bad or Awful rank on the Teriyaki Yoko stage, they will be struck by lightning resulting in this effect. It is seen again in a flashback in the Stage 7 cutscene, when Lammy plugs in electrical equipment.
 In the 2013 Deadpool game, the Merc with a Mouth gets this when he needs to open a door by making contact with a severed cable, grabbing it with both hands.
 Happens in Rampage World Tour to the playable characters whenever they hit any active electrical signs, appliances, or exposed wires.
 In the Doujin fighting game Another Force, Yuna's special attacks all have the ability to show off her opponent's skeleton.

 Command & Conquer: Red Alert's Tesla Coil: infantry dying from Tesla Coil weapons are briefly shown as glowing skeletons before collapsing in a pile of glowing bones. Infantry that gets hit by such weapons without dying, however, show no effect whatsoever.
 First Encounter Assault Recon has the Type 7 Particle Beam Rifle, which vaporizes the flesh off its victims' skeletons.
 The taser weapon in the Sega Genesis game Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition is insanely powerful, able to kill dinosaurs and people in a single shot. When you use it, you see the skeleton of whoever or whatever you use it on before they collapse into ashes.
 The Ray Gun from Another World, when it hits a victim, leaves a charred black skeleton that quickly crumbles into dust.
 Raiden's bowdlerised fatality in the SNES port of Mortal Kombat involves him shocking the opponent to such a degre that they're reduced to a skeleton which collapses into a pile of dust.

 In Fallout 3, critical hits by energy weapons can reduce a target to ashes or goo.
 If Bug gets killed by a lightning bug, he turns black and crumbles. Otherwise, the first instance occurs.
 Zombies that are killed by electrical attacks in Plants vs. Zombies 2 do this. That includes the Bug Zombie.
 Family Guy Video Game!
 While Stewie is exploring Peter's brain he will meet images of Lois. If one of Lois' images moves too close to one of Peter's nerves she'll be shocked and her skeleton will become visible inside a yellow aura as she's destroyed.
 While in Peter's bladder, Stewie must kill clones by shooting at them. When they're killed their skeletons become visible inside a yellow aura.
 Crush the Castle 2. One of the weapons that becomes available is a jar full of electric eels. If it hits anything made of metal, the electrical charge flows through all adjacent metal items. If the charge hits one of the human targets, you can see the person's skeleton inside their body as they're killed.
 This happens to Zanthia in The Legend of Kyrandia, Book Two: The Hand of Fate if she touches the electricity generated by the mill. In this case, only her clothes are left.
 Space Quest
 Happens in Space Quest VI: Roger Wilco in The Spinal Frontier when Roger uses the hand icon on the electrical outlet in his room, resulting a death being reduced to ashes, clothes intact.

 Occurs in the fighting game Verdict Guilty.
 In EarthBound, the Conducting Menace and Conducting Spirit enemies, which have Psycho Electro powers, always look like this in battle.
 In the Home Alone Licensed Game for the Sega Genesis, if Kevin, Harry, or Marv get caught by the Robot in the Ultra Modern House or the Ghost in the Colonial House, they will get electrocuted by them, causing this to happen.

 Occurs in The Queen of Battlers 2 to any character hit by Nue's electrical attacks.
 Characters that get hit with the Shock status in Persona 4: Arena Ultimax show up as this. Aigis and Labrys have basic metal frameworks instead, while Teddie, Margaret, Elizabeth, and Marie don't have skeletons at all.

 A few episodes of Danny Phantom have this, most notably "Maternal Instincts", in which Vlad electrocutes Danny with a device that causes him to lose his ghost powers temporarily. Despite Danny having a very cartoonish skeleton, this scene is not in any way played for laughs.
 Happens from time to time in Darkwing Duck. Pretty much any episode with the lightning-wielding Megavolt.
 Happens from time to time in Dexter's Laboratory.
 In the intro sequence for The Justice Friends shorts, Val Hallen tries to put in a lightbulb, but only gets shocked instead.

 Used in several episodes of The Fairly OddParents!; in one instance, it shows Wanda with a BONE inside her hair swirl.
 Several episodes of The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy use this, but the best example goes to "Scythe 2.0", when Billy, Mandy, and Grim are riding in an elevator in the Underworld, and everyone's skeletons flash...but since Grim, the Grim Reaper, is already a skeleton, he gains skin just for this gag.
 In Home Movies, Duane and McGuirk both show their skeletons in electrocutions, unusual for a show that's otherwise low-key and absent of exaggerated cartoony action.
 Inspector Gadget
 Happens to Chief Quimby in every Title Sequence, while inside a safe, as the self-destructing sheet of paper explodes to his face.
 Happens to Inspector Gadget too, in the episode "Gadget and Old Lace", when he is shocked by the electric chicken.

 South Park usually doesn't use this trope during electrocutions, but there have been a couple exceptions:
 Towards the end of the South Park Movie, Cartman, with his newfound lightning powers, blasts the beejezus out of Saddam Hussein, showing his skeleton several times.
 In Part 2 of the "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut" two-parter, Kenny has to sacrifice himself to get the power in the hospital back up, so he willingly electrocutes himself to start the generator back up.
 A disturbing take on this trope happens in Spider-Man: The New Animated Series with Electro. In his appearences, the victims that he shocks will flash into skeletons. While the 3d-rendered characters look cartoony, the skeletons do not.
 Sally, the one who gets electrocuted constantly cries, screams and begs for it to stop in a distorted voice. All of this while she flashes as a rotting skeleton. Egh!
 Spider-Man gets zapped too.

 Asajj Ventress, when hit by Dooku's force lightning in Star Wars: Clone Wars.
 Superman: The Animated Series has this happen to the already-electrifying Livewire when she blows up a water dam and gets all wet. Worth noting is that Superman himself gets electrocuted plenty of times, and it never happens to him. Probably because his skin's too tough for even needing a skeleton, who knows!
 On the other hand, in the final episode of Justice League Unlimited, when Superman is hit by Darkseid's electrical attack (which he dubs "The Agony Matrix"), the Man of Steel is indeed showing off his skeleton.

 In "Newbie Dash", Rainbow Dash wanders into a thundercloud which zaps her with a lightning bolt and lights up her skeleton in the process. Again in a Freeze-Frame Bonus, we see that pegasi have a cloud-shaped bone above the pelvis, and also that they have bones in their feathers, all the way to the wingtip.
 Secret Squirrel episode "Scuba Duba Duba". Scuba Duba hands Secret Squirrel an electric eel. When the eel shocks him Secret's body momentarily disappears, leaving only his skeleton.
 Used repeatedly in an episode of The New Adventures of Lucky Luke where a lightning strike grants Averell Dalton (and then Rantanplan) temporary Super Intelligence. Afterward, the Daltons uses a machine producing electricity to extend the effect.
 Grojband: Happens when Trina gets struck by lightning in "Super Zeroes".
 In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Baxter Stockman was was placed in a disintegration chamber by Krang after one failure too many. A fly entered the chamber with him, and after a brief X-ray spark Stockman was transformed into a giant mutant fly. This instance provided plenty of Nightmare Fuel; Baxter Stockman was pleading frantically for his life before and after being thrown in, and his screaming skeleton during the X-Ray spark was truly horrifying.
 Nickelodeon's TMNT uses this for many of the electrocutions, but especially on poor, poor Donnie. Also happens whenever Casey uses his homemade taser.
 In the original Courage the Cowardly Dog short, "The Chicken From Outer Space," after Eustace is mutated into a giant murderous chicken, Courage proceeds to vaporize him with a ray gun. Eustace turns into a skeleton a few times before dissolving into ash.
 "The Legend of Grimace Island", the second video of the series The Wacky Adventures Of Ronald Mc Donald, has a scene where Ronald gets struck by lightning and has his skeleton visible while standing near the crow's nest.
 Wander over Yonder: This happens to Lord Hater when Wander shocks him in "My Fair Hatey", but since Hater's already a skeleton, it just means his clothes disappear.
 Mike, Lu & Og
 In the pilot "Crash Lancelot", Lu becomes an x-ray as Og adds a nuclear-powered motor to her custom-made car.
 This happens to Mike in "Nobody's Nose", when she is zapped by a Personal Rain Cloud that Queeks conjured up.
 In "Scuba Doobie Doo", air-mailman Floyd flies his plane into a thundercloud, causing both him and his dog to become skeletons.
 The Mickey Mouse (2013) short "Swimmin' Hole" has Pete steal the swimming hole and secure it with an electric fence. Mickey, Donald, and Goofy try to get past the fence, only to get electrocuted with their skeletons visible.
