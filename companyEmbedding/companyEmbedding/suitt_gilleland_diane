 A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research, development, and commercialization potential of tech­nology in acid rain control. These papers by noted researchers, con­sultants, and program directors in the acid rain and energy field were delivered at a conference sponsored by the Illinois General Assembly and the Coal Extraction and Utilization Research Center at South­ern Illinois University, Carbondale. The book begins with a good tech­nological overview of the problem and possible solutions. Major points of inter­est are the roles of advanced coal cleaning technologies, flue-gas desulfurization (FGD), limestone injection multiphase burners (LIMB), fluidized-bed com­bustors (FBC), integrated combined-cycle systems, coal gasification, coal switching or compliance coal, and the use of nuclear energy in the control of acid deposition. Diane Suitt Gilleland and James H. Swisher also edited the previous con­ference proceedings, Acid Rain Control: The Costs of Compliance (Southern Illi­nois University Press).

Senior Associate Diane Suitt Gilleland



.







Washington, D.C., Jan. 12,1998—The Institute for Higher Education Policy is pleased to announce that Diane Suitt Gilleland will join the organization as Senior Associate, effective January 15. In her capacity as Senior Associate, Ms. Gilleland will provide analytic and project management expertise on issues concerning statewide governance and financing of higher education, student preparation, access and equity, and international trends in higher education financing and policy development.
Ms. Gilleland’s distinguished career in higher education includes more than a decade of service at the Arkansas Department of Higher Education. As Director of the Department and chief higher education officer for the State of Arkansas from 1990 to 1997, she oversaw the state’s $1.2 billion system of higher education, which enrolls more than 90,000 students in 32 public four- and two-year institutions. Ms. Gilleland’s many accomplishments include the establishment of the first statewide strategic plan for Arkansas higher education, the design of one of the nation’s first performance-based funding policies for the allocation of state funds, the implementation of an innovative academic cost accounting system, and the development of statewide educational reforms that have led to a reduction in remedial education rates.
In her previous work in higher education, Ms. Gilleland served as Associate Director for Finance for the Arkansas Department of Higher Education, and held leadership positions at the University of Arkansas at Monticello and Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. She recently completed a one-year assignment as Senior Fellow at the American Council on Education, and currently serves as a member of the Board of Directors of SLM Holding Corporation (Sallie Mae) and the Commission for Educational Quality of the Southern Region Education Board.






About the Institute for Higher Education Policy
The Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP) is an independent, nonprofit organization that is dedicated to increasing access and success in postsecondary education around the world. Established in 1993, the Washington, D.C.-based organization uses unique research and innovative programs to inform key decision makers who shape public policy and support economic and social development. IHEP’s web site, www.ihep.org, features an expansive collection of higher education information available free of charge and provides access to some of the most respected professionals in the fields of public policy and research.
