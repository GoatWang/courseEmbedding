As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

NEW YORK, November 10, 2016 – Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the New York Southern District Court on behalf of all persons or entities who acquired ProNAi Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: DNAI) securities between July 12, 2015 to June 6, 2016 (the “Class Period”).
The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, ProNAi made materially false and misleading statements about the potential and efficacy of its drug product candidate PNT2258 in the company’s public filings, which caused ProNAi’s stock price to be artificially inflated throughout the Class Period, thus harming investors.
On June 6, 2016, ProNAi revealed that the Phase 2 clinical trials of PNT2258 failed to produce sufficient efficacy results to justify continued clinical development of the drug and, thus, ProNAi was suspending clinical development of PNT2258. Following this news, shares of ProNAi fell more than 67 percent.
If you acquired ProNAi securities during the Class Period, have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters please contact J. Brandon Walker, Esq. by email at investigations@bespc.com, or telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out the contact form below. There is no cost or obligation to you.

ProNAi Therapeutics, Inc. Names New President and Chief Executive 
      Officer






September 03, 2014 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



PLYMOUTH, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ProNAi Therapeutics, Inc., a developer of novel nucleic acid 
      therapeutics, announces the appointment Nick Glover, Ph.D. as President 
      and Chief Executive Officer. The company’s previous CEO, Mina Sooch, 
      will be leaving the organization to pursue new opportunities.
    


      Dr. Glover, an accomplished biotech executive, brings to ProNAi 
      Therapeutics extensive experience in the field of oncology drug 
      development. Dr. Glover most recently served as President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of YM BioSciences Inc. (NYSE: YMI; TSX: YM), a 
      publicly traded oncology drug development company acquired by Gilead 
      Sciences Inc. in February 2013. Previously, Dr. Glover was President and 
      Chief Executive Officer of Viventia Biotech Inc., a drug development 
      company developing novel therapies for cancer, and Investment Manager at 
      MDS Capital, a life sciences venture capital firm. He currently serves 
      on the board of directors of MEI Pharma Inc., a company focused on 
      cancer drug development (NASDAQ: MEIP). Dr. Glover holds a B.Sc. in 
      chemistry from the University of East Anglia, Norwich, England and a 
      Ph.D. in chemistry from Simon Fraser University, British Columbia, 
      Canada.
    

      On behalf of ProNAi's board, Chairman Donald Parfet said, "The Company’s 
      organization has reached a critical juncture. We have demonstrated an 
      exciting therapeutic value in PNT2258, our lead product, and now need to 
      accelerate our efforts with expanded late-stage clinical trials. By 
      placing a leader with Nick’s talents and demonstrated capabilities we 
      significantly strengthen our abilities to commercialize the product 
      line." Mr. Parfet continued, "Nick’s strong reputation in cancer drug 
      development and his extensive experience leading public and private 
      biotechnology companies make him a superb choice to lead ProNAi at this 
      critical time."
    

      “I’ve been highly impressed by the quality of the development and 
      clinical work conducted by the ProNAi team, resulting in a portfolio of 
      promising novel drug candidates. I am excited and honored to join ProNAi 
      and look forward in particular to further advancing the clinical 
      development of PNT2258, which has generated compelling results to date,” 
      stated Dr. Glover. “There is a significant need to develop and deliver 
      therapies that will make a meaningful difference in the lives of cancer 
      patients. ProNAi’s proprietary DNAi technology is a promising emerging 
      modality that has the potential to yield impactful oncology 
      therapeutics, and I look forward to leading the company and bringing 
      these novel treatments to patients.”
    

      Donald Parfet continued: "On behalf of all of ProNAi’s stakeholders I 
      would like to thank Mina Sooch for her outstanding contributions to the 
      Company. ProNAi has made great strides under Mina’s stewardship, raising 
      significant capital, and successfully positioning ProNAi for aggressive 
      growth and value creation. Mina is a talented entrepreneur and seasoned 
      life sciences executive, and we wish her every success in her future 
      endeavors."
    

About PNT2258


      PNT2258 comprises a 24-base, single-stranded, chemically-unmodified DNA 
      oligonucleotide PNT100 encapsulated in a specialized anionic and 
      pH-sensitive liposome. In preclinical studies the beneficial activity of 
      PNT2258 has been demonstrated as a single agent and in combination with 
      CD20-targeted antibody therapy and other chemotherapeutic agents in a 
      variety of hematological and solid tumor xenograft models. PNT2258 
      exhibited systemic exposure and cellular uptake, resulting in cell death 
      by modulation of the BCL2 gene. To date, 35 patients have been treated 
      with PNT2258 across Phase I (Tolcher AW, et al. 2014 Cancer Chemotherapy 
      and Pharmacology 73(2): 363-371) and pilot Phase II studies 
      (Abstract#88, Oral Presentation, Novel Agents in Lymphoma Therapy 
      session, American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, December 
      2013).
    

About ProNAi Therapeutics, Inc.


      ProNAi Therapeutics is advancing DNA interference (DNAi®) technology, a 
      proprietary and differentiated nucleic acid therapeutic modality. DNAi 
      utilizes single-stranded, unmodified, phosphodiester DNA sequences 
      designed to specifically hybridize to genomic DNA and modulate gene 
      transcription. Beyond PNT2258, the company is developing DNAi assets
