History of Patten and Patten, Inc. 





Patten and Patten, Inc. was incorporated in 1976 by two brothers, Bryan and Cartter Patten. Previously, Cartter served as an investment analyst with a local life insurance company and Bryan was Chief Investment Officer for the Trust Department of a large Chattanooga bank. At that time, independent Investment Advisory firms were an emerging concept in the South.
Both brothers believed clients were best served by independent firms owned by those who worked there and were positioned to represent their client’s interest and achieve their objectives with well-researched, independent judgment. Their investment philosophy also included focusing on long-term fundamentals, balancing rewards and risks, and keeping expenses low.
This philosophy continues today. With over three decades of operations, the firm now has four Portfolio Managers who hold the Chartered Financial Analyst (“CFA”) designation. They divide their time between security analysis and quantitative market research. The firm also boasts a well-trained administrative staff of six to support the 600 client relationships – many evolving through client referrals.
