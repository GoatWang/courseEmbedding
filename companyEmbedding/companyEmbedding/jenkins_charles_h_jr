      ■ Charles H. Jenkins Jr. began his career in the retail food
      business in 1969 at Publix Super Markets in Lakeland, Florida. After
      working his way up the management ladder of the family-run business, he
      became chief operating officer (COO) in 2000, a position that was
      eliminated upon his appointment as chief executive officer (CEO) in 2001.
      During his tenure at Publix he developed a reputation for meticulous
      planning and a careful, methodical approach to growth.
    

      EARLY LIFE AND CAREER
    

      Charles H. Jenkins Jr.'s uncle George Jenkins opened the first
      Publix Super Market in Winter Haven, Florida, in 1930. From the beginning,
      stock was sold only to employees, family members, and members of the board
      of directors, making Publix the largest employee-owned grocery-store chain
      in the United States and Florida's largest private employer.
      Charles Jr.'s father, Charles Sr., began working for his older
      brother George in 1945, shortly after the company purchased the All
      American grocery store chain.
    

      Jenkins received a PhD in real estate from Harvard in 1969 and immediately
      went to work for Publix, beginning as assistant to the vice president of
      real estate. In 1974 he became vice president of real estate and was
      appointed to the company's board of directors. As the first
      generation of senior executives began to reach retirement age, Jenkins and
      his peers were put into key positions within the company. Industry
      insiders noted that this gradual process of turning over power was a key
      reason that Publix remained a consistent presence in the retail food
      business amid change and supermarket takeovers.
    

      In the book 
      
        Fifty Years of Pleasure
      
      , Pat Watters writes that Jenkins applied for a job at Publix upon
      completion of his doctorate. He wrote his thesis on shopping-center
      development. At first his uncle refused to employ him, telling Jenkins
      that the grocery-store business was too difficult for the younger man to
      master. Jenkins persisted, telling his uncle that he had tied up 90
      percent of his personal investments in Publix stock and that he wanted to
      have the chance to turn his investments into large profits. His uncle
      understood that reasoning and put him to work in the real-estate division.
      Jenkins admitted in an interview for the book that he believed Publix was
      simply the best chance he had for achieving his potential. Jenkins
      achieved a reputation equal to his uncle's in knowing how to locate
      stores in profitable areas.
    

      BEST PLACE TO WORK
    

      Under Jenkins's leadership, Publix expanded into the
      convenience-store and gas-station market under the name of Pix. Almost
      immediately these stores earned the reputation of being top of the line in
      that market, offering deli items and Publix private-label goods.
      Enterprise Florida recognized Publix in 2003 for its efforts to diversify
      and add to the state's economy. The Major Market Business Expansion
      Award recognized the efforts of Jenkins in 2002 to create jobs with higher
      wages and Publix's community involvement. The award cited Publix
      for spending $500 million on an expansion of the company's
      headquarters in Lakeland and opening 51 new stores. Jenkins accepted the
      award from Governor Jeb Bush. The award also recognized the
      company's humanitarian efforts for instituting the Food Industry
      Against Hunger campaign in 2002 and for its support of local, state, and
      national
       charities such as the March of Dimes. The family-run business stressed
      customer satisfaction as well as employee contentment. In 2003 readers of 
      
        Florida Monthly
      
       magazine voted Publix the best grocery store in the state. Fortune 500
      named it one of its most admired companies in 2003. As of 2004 employees
      owned about 27 percent of the company.
    

      SWIFT ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPANSION
    

      When Jenkins replaced his cousin, Howard Jenkins, as CEO, he vowed to
      honor the company's motto, "Where shopping is always a
      pleasure." Noted for his careful planning, Jenkins established a
      reputation in his early years for taking meticulous, well-planned steps
      toward building the company. He continued that approach as CEO.
    

      Until 1990 Jenkins and the company remained dedicated to the concept of
      not expanding outside of Florida. When the economic climate warranted a
      change, however, Jenkins led the company's expansion into Georgia,
      South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee. His research and homework in
      preparing the expansion impressed those watching the Fortune 500 company.
      Publix entered the Atlanta market in 1990. A research consultant noted
      that the growth of Publix in that area awed industry insiders. Within a
      decade the company had gone from having no stores to competing with Kroger
      for dominance in the area.
    

      When Publix moved into Tennessee and bought stores from Albertsons in
      2002, industry insiders were impressed with the thoroughness with which
      the company entered the market in the Nashville area. Analysts noted that
      Publix contacted the proper regulatory agencies and personally supervised
      every detail. During negotiations and development of the expansion, the
      owners of the company personally attended the meetings and made the phone
      calls.
    

      Jenkins continued following the original mission of Publix to promote
      high-quality food in order to become the best retailer in the world. He
      focused on giving customers value while not tolerating waste. Jenkins
      dedicated the business to remaining loyal to its stockholders and taking
      civic duties seriously. In his first year as CEO, profits grew 19 percent,
      with a 4.3 percent increase in revenue.
    

      Local residents are quick to praise and defend Lakeland's largest
      employer. One observer of Publix's success noted, with a hint of
      bias, that finding a disgruntled employee was impossible. Andrew Wolf, an
      analyst at BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond, Virginia, told 
      
        Progressive Grocer
      
       in 2003 that one of the reasons for employee loyalty were the incentives
      employees had as owners of the company. In 2003, for the seventh
      consecutive year, Publix received recognition as one of 
      
        Fortune
      
       magazine's 
      
        Top One Hundred Companies To Work For.
      
       This designation was determined by a survey of randomly selected
      employees that asked about management, peer relationships, and pride in
      working for Publix. Jenkins told 
      
        Fortune
      
      , "It is thrilling to know that our associates still consider
      Publix to be one of the best companies to work for in America."
      Publix also received the highest scores of any other supermarket for
      customer satisfaction in a national survey conducted by the American
      Customer Satisfaction Index in 2003.
    

      AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIES BRING RESULTS
    

      Jenkins followed established business standards while remaining willing to
      make changes that made good business sense. For example, he began a new
      policy in the 1970s while still working in the real estate division that
      saved the company time and money. When Jenkins began as vice president of
      real estate in 1974, Publix owned 25 percent of its locations. According
      to company records in 1980, it owned only one in six. Jenkins remain
      committed to the company's focus on carefully determining each
      store's location. When he could not find a developer to build and
      lease on a favorable site, Publix would build the store itself. Jenkins
      remarked in 
      
        Fifty Years of Pleasure
      
       that locating developers to build stores was easy because of
      Publix's reputation: "They know that having a good merchant
      in their shopping center is going to make it a more successful
      one." In 2003 
      
        Progressive Grocer
      
       compared Publix to Walt Disney World in Orlando. Like the renowned
      amusement park, Publix created a clean and pleasant experience for the
      shopper. The magazine noted that building loyalty among its customers left
      Publix with a heritage and its customers with a tradition.
    

      FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS EARNS RESPECT
    

      Publix developed a loyalty among its customers in Florida. The industry
      regarded Publix as a well-run supermarket chain, a view that continued
      under Jenkins's leadership. He did not waiver from his
      family's philosophy in providing a pleasant place to shop and work.
      As a result, Publix became one of the most respected family-run businesses
      in the United States. As expansion occurred outside the state of Florida,
      the same loyal following occurred.
    

      When Jenkins stopped the loyalty discount-card program, analysts initially
      wondered if the strategy would work. Later they conceded that the move had
      been successful because Publix had other strengths that its customers
      admired. Andrew Wolf noted in 
      
        Progressive Grocer
      
       that "A loyalty card is not powerful enough to trump what they
      offer, which is better merchandising, better service, higher quality, and
      superior facilities" (February 15, 2003).
    

      When the corporate headquarters in Lakeland were completed in 2003,
      observers noted that the 320,000-square-foot, crescent-shaped complex
      reflected the steady growth of Publix under the leadership of Jenkins and
      sent a message to the city of Lakeland that Publix planned to stay in its
      home community. Other supermarket companies looked to Publix with envy
      because it managed to retain its high quality while going through a rapid
      expansion.

Publix CEO Charles Jenkins Jr. To Retire







Thursday
Sep 6, 2007 at 2:32 AM
Sep 6, 2007 at 11:39 AM






				By KYLE KENNEDYThe Ledger
			
LAKELAND | Publix Super Markets Chief Executive Charles "Charlie" Jenkins Jr. will leave his post in March, ending a career spanning nearly four decades, the company announced WednesdayJenkins, 64, will be succeeded by President Ed Crenshaw. Officials said he will continue to serve on Publix's board and will become chairman following his March 29 retirement, taking over for cousin Howard Jenkins."His goal was that he would retire by the age of 65. He's staying true to that," said spokeswoman Maria Brous. "He's spending time with family and enjoying the things he loves to do."Jenkins and Crenshaw were not available for comment Wednesday, Brous said.Jenkins, the son of former Publix Chairman Charles Jenkins Sr. and nephew of company founder George Jenkins, joined Publix in 1969 as the assistant to Vice President of Real Estate Joe Blanton, who would go on to become president.Jenkins, educated at Emory University and Harvard, later served as vice president of real estate and executive vice president and chairman of the executive committee before being appointed to chief operating officer in 2000.He became CEO in May 2001 and succeeded Howard Jenkins, who will become chairman of Publix's executive committee following his cousin's retirement.Publix saw rapid growth during Charlie Jenkins' tenure, expanding from 655 stores in May 2001 to a current 907 in five Southeastern states. The Lakeland-based chain dominates Florida with a market share exceeding 40 percent, according to research firm Trade Dimensions.The company reported a flat profit of $530.4 million for 2001, but by 2006 it had exploded to $1.1 billion, crossing the billion-dollar mark for the first time. Sales totaled nearly $22 billion last year."Jenkins has continued with the great family legacy of making Publix the finest and largest regional retailer in the United States," said Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group in New York, a consulting firm that follows supermarket trends.Innovations during Jenkins' tenure include the Pix convenience stores, liquor stores, Publix's Hispanic-themed Sabor locations, walk-in clinics and the development of the GreenWise product line and store concept, which focuses on natural and organic foods.The company launched an online grocery business in September 2001, but pulled it two years later because of poor performance.Recently, Publix began testing a curbside carry-out service for deli items at a store in Fort Myers, and debuted an in-store Carrabba's Italian Market at a Sarasota location.The firm also has plans to test a meal-assembly store concept in Jacksonville and Lithia, in which customers register for sessions and prepare meals using ingredients and recipes supplied by Publix.Negative publicity during Jenkins' tenure was rare, but in 2005 Publix reached a compliance agreement in U.S. District Court on a federal class-action suit. The suit was filed by people with disabilities and resulted in physical changes to Publix stores, including adding parking spaces wide enough for vans.In addition, Publix endured public criticism this year for an aggressive pay plan that cut some employees' wages. The company also quietly discontinued a pharmacy price-matching program on the same day it announced an initiative to provide free common antibiotics to customers with prescriptions.Those gaffes, however, have had no discernible impact on Publix's bottom line, and industry observers say they expect continued success under Crenshaw, 56, the son of George Jenkins' adopted daughter. Crenshaw joined Publix as a clerk in Lake Wales in 1974 and went on to become vice president of the Lakeland division in 1990, the same year he was elected to the board of directors.The Baylor University graduate started the now-thriving Atlanta division in 1991 and became president in 1996 after a stint as executive vice president of retailing."Ed has been there many years, so he's been through almost every aspect of their operation and has a good feel for what works with the company," said Lorrie Griffith, editor of the Southeast edition of the Shelby Report, a monthly publication based in Gainesville, Ga., that covers the food distribution industry."Publix has really put together the best combination of family management and executive management almost worldwide," Flickinger added. "Crenshaw will confirm Mr. Jenkins' commitment to achieve record sales growth, market share and profitability to create more opportunities for the next generation of leadership teams."Crenshaw's replacement will be Todd Jones, Publix's senior vice president of product business development. Jones, 45, joined Publix as a clerk in New Smyrna Beach 1980 and became a store manager eight years later.He served as a district manager, regional director and vice president of the Jacksonville division before being promoted to his current position in 2005."We are pleased to have leaders with the experience of Ed and Todd who are ready to take the next steps in their careers," Charlie Jenkins Jr. said in a prepared statement. "I'm confident they will be successful in continuing Publix's success."[ Kyle Kennedy can be reached at kyle.kennedy@theledger.com or 863-802-7584. ]

JENKINS, CHARLES H.





JENKINS, CHARLES H. (1852–1931). Charles H. Jenkins, politician and surveyor, son of Jonathan E. and Mahala (Bonner) Jenkins, was born in Dallas County, Texas, on May 17, 1852. His father was a surveyor and merchant who served the Confederate cause during the Civil War and died shortly thereafter. Jenkins attended private school in Dallas and Cedar Springs to study surveying. In 1870 he also began the study of law. His studies were interrupted in 1871, when he became Dallas county surveyor. With W. S. Duncan, he made the first complete map of Dallas. He also took on the job of city engineer in 1873. He was admitted to the bar in 1874 and in later years was without peer in boundary cases.
In 1879 Jenkins moved to Brownwood, where he was elected mayor and served several terms as an alderman. He also served twenty-six consecutive years on the local school board, fourteen as president. He briefly owned the Brownwood Bulletin. He was a strong advocate of paper money and served on the platform committee of the Greenback party in 1882. He was a presidential elector for the Greenback-Labor party in 1884. Jenkins became a member of the People's (Populist) party in the 1890s. He served on its state executive committee from 1892 to 1894 and was a delegate to the party's 1892 and 1896 national conventions. He was a member of the Texas Populist platform committee in 1892, 1894, and 1896. He was secretary in 1892 and chairman in 1896. The party nominated him for United States Congress from the Eighth District in 1894 and 1896. He narrowly lost both times, probably through fraud in 1894. He joined the Democratic party in 1898 and was a delegate to every state convention between 1898 and 1910. He served on the state platform committee in 1904, 1906, and 1908 and was a delegate to the Democratic national convention of 1904. In 1903 he put out a call for the convention that organized the Texas Local Option Association.
Jenkins was elected to the Thirtieth (1907) and Thirty-first (1909) Texas legislatures, where he voted with the progressives. In 1910 Governor Thomas M. Campbell appointed him to an unexpired term in the Texas Court of Appeals. Jenkins was reelected until 1923, when he resigned to become chairman of the State Codifying Commission. He served on this committee until his death. Jenkins married Annie E. Smith, a former schoolmate, in September 1873. They had three daughters. He was a member of the Christian Church, the Odd Fellows, the Woodmen of the World, and the Texas State Historical Association. He died at Brownwood on February 23, 1931.

Charles H. Jenkins Jr.1944–
Chief executive officer and director, Publix Super Markets 
Nationality: American.
Born: 1944.
Education: Emory University, BBA, 1964; MBA, 1965; Harvard, PhD, 1969.
Family: Son of Charles Jenkins Sr. (retailer); married Dorothy Chao; children: two.
Career: Publix Super Markets, 1969–1974, assistant to the vice president of real estate; 1974–1988, vice president of real estate; 1988–1990, executive vice president; 1990–2000, chairman of the executive committee; 2000–2001, chief operating officer; 2001–, chief executive officer.
Address: Publix Super Markets, 3300 Airport Road, Lakeland, Florida 33811; http://www.publix.com.
■ Charles H. Jenkins Jr. began his career in the retail food business in 1969 at Publix Super Markets in Lakeland, Florida. After working his way up the management ladder of the family-run business, he became chief operating officer (COO) in 2000, a position that was eliminated upon his appointment as chief executive officer (CEO) in 2001. During his tenure at Publix he developed a reputation for meticulous planning and a careful, methodical approach to growth.
EARLY LIFE AND CAREER
Charles H. Jenkins Jr.'s uncle George Jenkins opened the first Publix Super Market in Winter Haven, Florida, in 1930. From the beginning, stock was sold only to employees, family members, and members of the board of directors, making Publix the largest employee-owned grocery-store chain in the United States and Florida's largest private employer. Charles Jr.'s father, Charles Sr., began working for his older brother George in 1945, shortly after the company purchased the All American grocery store chain.


Jenkins received a PhD in real estate from Harvard in 1969 and immediately went to work for Publix, beginning as assistant to the vice president of real estate. In 1974 he became vice president of real estate and was appointed to the company's board of directors. As the first generation of senior executives began to reach retirement age, Jenkins and his peers were put into key positions within the company. Industry insiders noted that this gradual process of turning over power was a key reason that Publix remained a consistent presence in the retail food business amid change and supermarket takeovers.
In the book Fifty Years of Pleasure, Pat Watters writes that Jenkins applied for a job at Publix upon completion of his doctorate. He wrote his thesis on shopping-center development. At first his uncle refused to employ him, telling Jenkins that the grocery-store business was too difficult for the younger man to master. Jenkins persisted, telling his uncle that he had tied up 90 percent of his personal investments in Publix stock and that he wanted to have the chance to turn his investments into large profits. His uncle understood that reasoning and put him to work in the real-estate division. Jenkins admitted in an interview for the book that he believed Publix was simply the best chance he had for achieving his potential. Jenkins achieved a reputation equal to his uncle's in knowing how to locate stores in profitable areas.

Under Jenkins's leadership, Publix expanded into the convenience-store and gas-station market under the name of Pix. Almost immediately these stores earned the reputation of being top of the line in that market, offering deli items and Publix private-label goods. Enterprise Florida recognized Publix in 2003 for its efforts to diversify and add to the state's economy. The Major Market Business Expansion Award recognized the efforts of Jenkins in 2002 to create jobs with higher wages and Publix's community involvement. The award cited Publix for spending $500 million on an expansion of the company's headquarters in Lakeland and opening 51 new stores. Jenkins accepted the award from Governor Jeb Bush. The award also recognized the company's humanitarian efforts for instituting the Food Industry Against Hunger campaign in 2002 and for its support of local, state, and national charities such as the March of Dimes. The family-run business stressed customer satisfaction as well as employee contentment. In 2003 readers of Florida Monthly magazine voted Publix the best grocery store in the state. Fortune 500 named it one of its most admired companies in 2003. As of 2004 employees owned about 27 percent of the company.
SWIFT ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPANSION
When Jenkins replaced his cousin, Howard Jenkins, as CEO, he vowed to honor the company's motto, "Where shopping is always a pleasure." Noted for his careful planning, Jenkins established a reputation in his early years for taking meticulous, well-planned steps toward building the company. He continued that approach as CEO.
Until 1990 Jenkins and the company remained dedicated to the concept of not expanding outside of Florida. When the economic climate warranted a change, however, Jenkins led the company's expansion into Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee. His research and homework in preparing the expansion impressed those watching the Fortune 500 company. Publix entered the Atlanta market in 1990. A research consultant noted that the growth of Publix in that area awed industry insiders. Within a decade the company had gone from having no stores to competing with Kroger for dominance in the area.
When Publix moved into Tennessee and bought stores from Albertsons in 2002, industry insiders were impressed with the thoroughness with which the company entered the market in the Nashville area. Analysts noted that Publix contacted the proper regulatory agencies and personally supervised every detail. During negotiations and development of the expansion, the owners of the company personally attended the meetings and made the phone calls.
Jenkins continued following the original mission of Publix to promote high-quality food in order to become the best retailer in the world. He focused on giving customers value while not tolerating waste. Jenkins dedicated the business to remaining loyal to its stockholders and taking civic duties seriously. In his first year as CEO, profits grew 19 percent, with a 4.3 percent increase in revenue.
Local residents are quick to praise and defend Lakeland's largest employer. One observer of Publix's success noted, with a hint of bias, that finding a disgruntled employee was impossible. Andrew Wolf, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond, Virginia, told Progressive Grocer in 2003 that one of the reasons for employee loyalty were the incentives employees had as owners of the company. In 2003, for the seventh consecutive year, Publix received recognition as one of Fortune magazine's Top One Hundred Companies To Work For. This designation was determined by a survey of randomly selected employees that asked about management, peer relationships, and pride in working for Publix. Jenkins told Fortune, "It is thrilling to know that our associates still consider Publix to be one of the best companies to work for in America." Publix also received the highest scores of any other supermarket for customer satisfaction in a national survey conducted by the American Customer Satisfaction Index in 2003.
AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIES BRING RESULTS
Jenkins followed established business standards while remaining willing to make changes that made good business sense. For example, he began a new policy in the 1970s while still working in the real estate division that saved the company time and money. When Jenkins began as vice president of real estate in 1974, Publix owned 25 percent of its locations. According to company records in 1980, it owned only one in six. Jenkins remain committed to the company's focus on carefully determining each store's location. When he could not find a developer to build and lease on a favorable site, Publix would build the store itself. Jenkins remarked in Fifty Years of Pleasure that locating developers to build stores was easy because of Publix's reputation: "They know that having a good merchant in their shopping center is going to make it a more successful one." In 2003 Progressive Grocer compared Publix to Walt Disney World in Orlando. Like the renowned amusement park, Publix created a clean and pleasant experience for the shopper. The magazine noted that building loyalty among its customers left Publix with a heritage and its customers with a tradition.
FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS EARNS RESPECT


Publix developed a loyalty among its customers in Florida. The industry regarded Publix as a well-run supermarket chain, a view that continued under Jenkins's leadership. He did not waiver from his family's philosophy in providing a pleasant place to shop and work. As a result, Publix became one of the most respected family-run businesses in the United States. As expansion occurred outside the state of Florida, the same loyal following occurred.
When Jenkins stopped the loyalty discount-card program, analysts initially wondered if the strategy would work. Later they conceded that the move had been successful because Publix had other strengths that its customers admired. Andrew Wolf noted in Progressive Grocer that "A loyalty card is not powerful enough to trump what they offer, which is better merchandising, better service, higher quality, and superior facilities" (February 15, 2003).
When the corporate headquarters in Lakeland were completed in 2003, observers noted that the 320,000-square-foot, crescent-shaped complex reflected the steady growth of Publix under the leadership of Jenkins and sent a message to the city of Lakeland that Publix planned to stay in its home community. Other supermarket companies looked to Publix with envy because it managed to retain its high quality while going through a rapid expansion.

Last Updated Apr 2, 2008 12:25 PM EDT

Charles H. Jenkins, Jr., steps down this week after a seven-year run as CEO of Publix Super Markets Inc., the Southeast's grocery powerhouse with 928 stores in five states. Taking over is Jenkins' cousin and Publix President William "Ed" Crenshaw.

Based in Lakeland, Fla., and run by a Southern dynasty (two other cousins and a brother-in-law are on the board), Publix defies Spanish moss-covered stereotypes, winning accolades as a progressive employee-owned company, including Fortune's 100 Best Places to Work for 10 years running. Retail consultant Burt Flickinger told the Lakeland Ledger that Jenkins was the "valedictorian" of the current crop of grocery CEOs. "He was a great innovator and a great marketer. And a very tough competitor."
Jenkins, 64, a nephew of Publix founder George W. Jenkins, replaced his cousin Howard as CEO in 2001. Under his direction, the chain grew from 655 stores to 928. Crenshaw, 57, married George Jenkins' daughter and began as a stock clerk in Lake Wales in 1974. He made his mark as the architect of Publix' first out-of-state launch into Atlanta, where the chain is now third behind Kroger and Wal-Mart.

With 2007 sales of $23 billion, Publix has benefited from the declining fortunes of Albertsons, Winn-Dixie and Piggly Wiggly in the southeast. It has experimented with new formats including Pix convenience stores, Sabor markets for Hispanic shoppers and a natural format called GreenWise Markets. It owns 41 Crispers salad restaurants in Florida, and in November, Publix opened Apron's Make-Ahead Meals, the grocery industry's first foray into the $1 billion meal preparation business.
"We don't claim to have the biggest stores or the lowest prices," Crenshaw told the Lakeland Chamber of Commerce last month. "Our position in the market is very simple: high quality and great service."
