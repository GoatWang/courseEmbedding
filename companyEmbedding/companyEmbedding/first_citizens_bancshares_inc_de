These increases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $419,000 primarily related to higher rates paid on short-term borrowings.

History[edit]
In 1998, First Citizens Bank made an agreement with First Citizens Bank of South Carolina, also controlled by the Frank Holding family, allowing customers of either bank to conduct transactions with the other institution.[3]
On Dec 22, 2003, Citizens Bancshares restated its previously announced 2003 third quarter earnings, following a determination by its independent auditors to change its accounting treatment of one third quarter transaction related to shares of the Company's common stock donated to it by an unrelated third party.[4]
On October 8, 2010, First Citizens filed a merger application with federal regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and respective state banking departments in IronStone's footprint. IronStone Bank will continue to operate under its trade name.[5] The change became official January 7, 2011.[6]
First Citizens Bank entered into an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) to purchase substantially all the assets and assume the majority of the liabilities of United Western Bank, Denver, Colorado on January 21, 2011.[7] Months later First Citizens took over the failed Colorado Capital Bank of Castle Rock, Colorado in a similar deal. It was the sixth FDIC-related agreement since July 2009.[8] First Citizens now has 14 branches in Colorado, 3 of them IronStone.[9]

As of September 30, 2013, Hendersonville, North Carolina-based 1st Financial had 12 branches in Western North Carolina, $675 million in assets and $660 million in deposits. In spring 2014, accounts of Mountain 1st Bank & Trust are to change to First Citizens.[10]
On October 1, 2014, First Citizens completed a merger with First Citizens Bank of South Carolina, making First Citizens the sixth-largest bank in the Southeast resulting in the largest bank in the United States controlled by a single family. First Citizens had no branches in South Carolina before the merger, while First Citizens and the South Carolina-based bank both had branches in Georgia.[1][11]
On March 11, 2016, North Milwaukee State Bank of Milwaukee, the first bank to fail in 2016, was taken over and the FDIC appointed receiver. First Citizens agreed to purchase most of the $67.1 million in assets and all of the deposits.[12]
On May 6, 2016, First Citizens announced the purchase of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based First CornerStone Bank, the third financial institution to fail in 2016, with six branches, $103.3 million in assets and $101 million in deposits.[13]
In September 2016, First Citizens completed its $35 million purchase of Cordia Bancorp Inc. of Midlothian, Virginia, with $353.8 million in assets.[14]
On January 13, 2017, First Citizens announced it agreed to take over the failed Harvest Community Bank of Pennsville, New Jersey, with $126.4 million in assets and four branches.[14]
On May 5, 2017, First Citizens announced it agreed to take over the failed Milwaukee-based Guaranty Bank of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with estimated $1 billion in assets.[15]

In 1998, First Citizens Bank made an agreement with First Citizens Bank of South Carolina, also controlled by the Frank Holding family, allowing customers of either bank to conduct transactions with the other institution.[3]
On Dec 22, 2003, Citizens Bancshares restated its previously announced 2003 third quarter earnings, following a determination by its independent auditors to change its accounting treatment of one third quarter transaction related to shares of the Company's common stock donated to it by an unrelated third party.[4]
On October 8, 2010, First Citizens filed a merger application with federal regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and respective state banking departments in IronStone's footprint.

On March 11, 2016, North Milwaukee State Bank of Milwaukee, the first bank to fail in 2016, was taken over and the FDIC appointed receiver. First Citizens agreed to purchase most of the $67.1 million in assets and all of the deposits.[12]

History[edit]
In 1998, First Citizens Bank made an agreement with First Citizens Bank of South Carolina, also controlled by the Frank Holding family, allowing customers of either bank to conduct transactions with the other institution.[3]
On Dec 22, 2003, Citizens Bancshares restated its previously announced 2003 third quarter earnings, following a determination by its independent auditors to change its accounting treatment of one third quarter transaction related to shares of the Company's common stock donated to it by an unrelated third party.[4]
On October 8, 2010, First Citizens filed a merger application with federal regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and respective state banking departments in IronStone's footprint. IronStone Bank will continue to operate under its trade name.[5] The change became official January 7, 2011.[6]
First Citizens Bank entered into an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) to purchase substantially all the assets and assume the majority of the liabilities of United Western Bank, Denver, Colorado on January 21, 2011.[7] Months later First Citizens took over the failed Colorado Capital Bank of Castle Rock, Colorado in a similar deal. It was the sixth FDIC-related agreement since July 2009.[8] First Citizens now has 14 branches in Colorado, 3 of them IronStone.[9]
On December 10, 2013, 1st Financial Corp. shareholders approved a merger with First Citizens. As of September 30, 2013, Hendersonville, North Carolina-based 1st Financial had 12 branches in Western North Carolina, $675 million in assets and $660 million in deposits. In spring 2014, accounts of Mountain 1st Bank & Trust are to change to First Citizens.[10]
On October 1, 2014, First Citizens completed a merger with First Citizens Bank of South Carolina, making First Citizens the sixth-largest bank in the Southeast resulting in the largest bank in the United States controlled by a single family. First Citizens had no branches in South Carolina before the merger, while First Citizens and the South Carolina-based bank both had branches in Georgia.[1][11]
On March 11, 2016, North Milwaukee State Bank of Milwaukee, the first bank to fail in 2016, was taken over and the FDIC appointed receiver. First Citizens agreed to purchase most of the $67.1 million in assets and all of the deposits.[12]
On May 6, 2016, First Citizens announced the purchase of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based First CornerStone Bank, the third financial institution to fail in 2016, with six branches, $103.3 million in assets and $101 million in deposits.[13]
In September 2016, First Citizens completed its $35 million purchase of Cordia Bancorp Inc. of Midlothian, Virginia, with $353.8 million in assets.[14]
On January 13, 2017, First Citizens announced it agreed to take over the failed Harvest Community Bank of Pennsville, New Jersey, with $126.4 million in assets and four branches.[14]
On May 5, 2017, First Citizens announced it agreed to take over the failed Milwaukee-based Guaranty Bank of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with estimated $1 billion in assets.[15]

FCNCA: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 11/30/2016 settlement date, and First Citizens BancShares Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 6.82 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.21. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.
