 Career History



Senior Partner

                                    2007 - Current                


Apollo Global Management LLC (Private Equity)


                  Apollo Global Private Equity is a contrarian, value-oriented investor with significant expertise in distressed opportunities. The firm focuses on opportunities where they can serve as a catalyst for business-transforming events and create significant value. They invest primarily in the following sectors: (1) chemicals (2) commodities (3) consumer and retail (4) distribution and transportation (5) financial services and business services (6) manufacturing and industrial (7) media, cable and leisure (8) packaging and materials and (9) satellite and wireless.Apollo Global Private Equity seeks to capitalize on market dislocations through a traditional and distressed buyout approach. They seek to make attractive investments by buying the debt of quality businesses, converting that debt to equity, creating value through active participation with management and ultimately monetizing the investment.  The firm's private equity investment activities are executed through several strategies including traditional buyouts, distressed buyouts and debt investments and corporate partner buyouts.Historically, traditional buyouts have comprised the majority of the firm's investments. Apollo Global Private Equity generally targets investments in companies with entrepreneurial management teams that are comfortable operating in a leveraged environment. They also pursue acquisitions in which they believe a non-core business owned by a large corporation can function more effectively if structured as an independent entity. Their LBOS generally involve consolidation situations through merger or follow-on acquisitions, carve-outs from larger organizations seeking to shed non-core assets, situations requiring structured ownership to meet a seller's financial goals or situations in which the business plan involves a substantial departure from past practices.For their distressed buyout and debt investments, Apollo Global Private Equity targets assets with high-quality operating businesses but low-quality balance sheets. The distressed securities they purchase include bank debt, public high-yield debt and privately-held instruments, often with significant downside protection in the form of a senior position in the capital structure.Though corporate partner buyouts, the firm seeks to capitalize on investment opportunities during environments in which purchase prices for control of companies are at high multiplies of earnings. Apollo Global Private Equity focuses on companies that need a financial partner to consummate acquisitions, expand product lines, buy back stock or pay down debt. In these investments, the firm does not seek control but instead makes significant investments that typically allow them to obtain control rights similar to those that they require in traditional buyouts.In addition to traditional, distressed and corporate partner buyout activities, Apollo Global Private Equity also deploys the capital of their private equity funds in other types of investments, such as the creation of new companies. The firm seeks to capitalize on market opportunities they have identified, particularly in asset-intensive industries that are in distress. In these types of situations, Apollo Global Private Equity is able to establish new entities that can acquire distressed assets at what the firm believes are attractive valuations without the burden of managing an existing portfolio of legacy assets.                




Founding Partner

                                    2005 - Current                


Infinity Point LLC






Senior Partner, Private Equity

                                    Current                


Apollo Global Management LLC


                  Since its founding in 1990, Apollo has grown to become one of the world's largest alternative investment managers.  As of June 30, 2012, we had total assets under management of $105 billion, with a team of 616 employees located in ten offices around the world.

 

We attribute our success to our key competitive strengths:  

    our investment process and approach to investing, which incorporates our flexibility to invest throughout market cycles and across the capital structure, our deep industry expertise and focus on complex transactions, our investment edge which creates proprietary investment opportunities, and our collaboration with portfolio company management teams;
    our integrated business model which combines the strength of our private equity, credit-oriented capital markets, and real estate platforms, and also includes a dedicated Natural Resources Fund;
    our long-standing investor relationships which include many of the world’s most prominent pension and endowment funds, financial institutions and individuals;
    our long-term capital base; 
    our strong management team and reputation; and
    our alignment of interests with investors in our funds and shareholders.

We operate our businesses in an integrated manner, which we believe distinguishes us from other alternative investment managers. Our investment professionals frequently collaborate and share information across disciplines including market insight, management, banking and consultant contacts as well as potential investment opportunities, which contributes to our library of industry knowledge and enables us to invest successfully across a company’s capital structure. The integrated Apollo platform and the experience of our investment team have enabled us to deliver strong long-term investment performance in our funds throughout a range of economic cycles.  

 

Our investment approach is value-oriented, focusing on industries in which we have considerable knowledge, and emphasizing downside protection and the preservation of capital.  We are frequently contrarian in our investment approach, which is reflected in a number of ways, including: 

    our willingness to invest in industries that our competitors typically avoid;
    the often complex structures we employ in some of our investments, including our willingness to pursue difficult corporate carve-out transactions;
    our experience investing during periods of uncertainty or distress in the economy or financial markets;
    our orientation towards sole-sponsored transactions; and
    our willingness to undertake transactions that have substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity. 

We have successfully applied this investment philosophy since Apollo's founding, allowing us to identify what we believe to be attractive investment opportunities, deploy capital across the balance sheet of industry leading businesses, and create value for our investors throughout economic cycles.
