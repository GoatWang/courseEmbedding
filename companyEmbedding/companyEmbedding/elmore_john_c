Reviews - What do customers think about Nurturing the Leader Within Your Child: What Every Parent Needs to Know?
OUTSTANDING RESOURCE!  Dec 17, 2001
Tim Elmore is one of the finest yet-to-be-discovered leaders in the areas of Church Ministry,Discipleship and Leadership having a worldwide impact. Mentored by Dr. John Maxwell in the 1980's while both were on staff at Skyline Church,San Diego CA, theycurrently share ministry teamwork through Dr. Maxwell's INJOY organization based in Atlanta.Tim has written several prior books, including the excellentSoul Provider. He is highly sought out as a discipler of church,ministry,missions and business leaders. He writes and speaks withpassion,expertise, yet humble acknowledgement of his true sourceof insight: the Lord Jesus Christ through Biblical principles.This book takes a step back from church/business leadership and asks "How are things at home?" If the successful principles thatare so effective outside the home are valid, how much moreso whenapplied to identifying the next generation's leaders: our kids!Weaving many practical principles with real life anecdotes anddown-to-earth illustrations of how Leadership works in his ownhousehold, Elmore helps us identify leadership traits/potentialresiding under our roof in the yet-to-be-developed young livesof our kids. He recognizes that God has given us our childrenas our most valuable resource for impacting this and futuregenerations; how much more should we invest in them what theBible teaches about "Train a child in the WAY HE/SHE SHOULD GO",not necessarily the way we as parents may mistakenly think theyought to go in terms of temperament,gift/skill mix,personality,individual potential,etc.Excellent reading,hard to put down, and immediately applicable.Ideal as a gift for anyone with kids who wants to help themdevelop their fullest potential and be all that God lovingly,individually,uniquely,wonderfully created them to be and BECOME! Write your own review about Nurturing the Leader Within Your Child: What Every Parent Needs to Know

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

Nonfiction books span the gamut of human experience, and some people have done unbelievable things. Nonfiction isn't limited to memoirs and biographies, either; it covers anything that isn't made up.Take a Step Into the PastHistory has always been a popular form of nonfiction, largely because there are so many different kinds of history. You can study everything from military history, to the history of quilting on the Canadian prairies. Anything people have ever done has a history, and in most cases you can find a nonfiction book about it. History covers everything from the broad sweep of empires to the personal stories of a single week in an individual's life. It's the story of humanity.Discover Your Inner SpiritualityEven as the world grows more and more materialistic, people find themselves turning toward nonfiction books on religion and spirituality. These books provide many people a way to find meaning in a world that is moving faster and faster every day. You can find everything from closely reasoned apologetics for the major faiths, to New Age life guides in the same place. Perhaps you'll succeed at your quest for meaning between the pages of a nonfiction book.Everyone Has to EatAll cultures have one thing in common; recipes. No matter what the culture, someone has written a cookbook, spreading cuisine around the world. You can find books on French, German, Italian, Caribbean, and just about any other form of cuisine you can imagine. In addition to cookbooks, there is also a whole world of diet books. Whether you want to lose weight, gain weight, or manage a health condition, there is a diet book to fit your needs.The Eyes Have ItArt and photography books bring the vision of the world to your very eyes. Art is fundamental to the human experience, and just one art book can show you millions of dollars' worth of old masters from around the world without the need to leave your couch. Photography books let you see the world as people like Ansel Adams and F-Stop Fitzgerald see it.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksNonfiction BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesTextbooks & Educational BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverPaperbackMixed LotSubjectsee allArt & PhotographyBiography & AutobiographyBooks on CollectingHistoryMilitary & WarReligion & SpiritualitySports & RecreationTransportationPublication Yearsee all1800-18991900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSpecial Attributessee all1st EditionDust JacketEx-LibraryIllustratedLarge PrintSignedLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

Product Description▼▲
How do I bring out the best in my child? What can I do to help my children reach their full potential? Why is it important to encourage leadership in my child? John Maxwell protigi, Dr. Tim Elmore, answers these questions and others in Nurturing the Leader Within Your Child. Using a survey of over 3,000 students, he enters the minds of today's youth to understand their desire to affect their world, their way. Beginning with a foreword by John C. Maxwell, the book is in four unique sections (What You Need to Know, What They Need to Know, When to Seize the Moment, How to Pass it On). Dr. Elmore gives practical tools for bridging the generation gap to foster character and growth in your children. Offering a list of fundamental qualities every leader must possess, Dr. Elmore helps parents and youth workers recognize teachable moments and equips them to structure an individual mentoring plan for each child. Finally, he offers evaluation methods for recognizing progress.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
