Our Philosophy - Portfolio Management





Long-term fundamental value

Markets often misprice securities. Prices deviate from fundamental fair value, but over time, they adjust to reflect inflation, credit quality fundamentals and liquidity conditions. Consistently investing in undervalued securities can deliver superior investment returns.
                    
We can systematically identify mispricings. We believe we can identify and capitalize on markets and securities that are priced below fundamental fair value. We do this through disciplined and rigorous analysis, comparing prices to the fundamental fair values estimated by our macroeconomic and credit research teams around the globe.
                    
                    
Our portfolios emphasize our highest convictions. The greater the difference between our view of fair value and markets' pricing, the bigger the potential value opportunity. The greater the degree of confidence in our view of fundamentals, the greater the emphasis of the strategies in our portfolios.
                    




Multiple diversified strategies

We seek diversified sources of returns. Our objective is to meet or exceed our investors' performance objectives within their tolerances for risk. We seek to diversify investments and add value across interest rate duration, yield curve, sector allocation, security selection, country and currency strategies.  We deploy multiple diversified strategies that benefit in different environments so no one strategy dominates performance, helping to dampen volatility.

Fed Balance Sheet Normalization: When Boring Is Good
by Bonnie M. Wongtrakool
At the start of 2017, Federal Reserve (Fed) members began sharing their views on the Fed’s balance sheet with increasing frequency. This renewed attention to balance sheet normalization brought back memories of the 2013 “taper tantrum,” with some investors warning that the Fed’s exit from the Treasu...

Gilt Yields: How Low Is Too Low?
by Andrew J. Belshaw
With UK government gilt yields near historic lows, the prevailing wisdom is that gilts are now prohibitively expensive and wise investors should steer clear. For those of us with long memories, this view is reminiscent of the experience of the Japanese government bond market 20 years ago, when Japan...

Dry Facts About the New SEC Liquidity Rules

On September 22, 2015, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released a 415-page document—Investment Company Act Release No. 31835—that proposed “…rules and forms designed to promote effective liquidity risk management throughout the open-end fund industry, thereby reducing the risk that f...

Macro Opportunities: A Flexible Approach to Macro Investing

In 2012, Western Asset set out to develop an aggressive, unconstrained fixed-income strategy—Macro Opportunities (MO)—to offer our clients the opportunity to generate returns in a slow-growth, low-rate environment. It needed to be both opportunistic and defensive, yet offer a compelling risk/reward ...

Hung by the Polls: Mayhem in June

When to hold and when to fold—the keys to success that every gambler knows. Prime Minister Theresa May clearly didn’t heed that sentiment when she decided in mid-April to call an early election, thereby forsaking  a guaranteed three further years as Prime Minister for the prospect of a larger and lo...

Fed Hiking, But Not Tightening

The Federal Reserve (Fed) raised the federal funds target rate as expected on Wednesday despite unspectacular growth, underwhelming inflation and only modest wage growth. The Fed certainly took all of these factors into account, as well as considering the positive growth in the US and improving grow...

Toward LDI Solutions That Actually Work

You are a defined-benefit (DB) pension plan sponsor who has improved funded status to the point where you want to seriously de-risk via a customized Liability Driven Investing (LDI) solution. What kind of allocation should you adopt? Most of our competitors would advise building a solution portfolio...














May 31, 2017
Market Commentary

Less than a year ago, a prevailing topic of discussion among the economic academic community and market participants was “secular stagnation.” Developed countries would have paltry growth for the indefinite future. Policies and planning would have to adapt to this reality. Commodity prices had plumm...

What Goes Up, Can Go Down—How Durable Is the Recent Recovery in Global Inflation Rates?

The path of global inflation is rightly never far from the minds of monetary policymakers and investors. Until recently, however, the global central banks’ emphasis has been upon avoiding deflation rather than restraining inflation. Last year’s US election result changed this, fostering a fiscally l...

Offering Income in a Yield-Starved World: Multi-Asset Credit (MAC) at Western Asset

In today’s low-interest-rate world, finding an attractive source of income remains a challenge for individual investors, pension funds and institutions globally. The challenge stems from both the myriad investment opportunities now available, as well as the inherent complexities surrounding asset al...

Emerging Markets Debt

Western Asset continues to be constructive on emerging markets debt (EMD) as we believe fundamentals, valuations and technicals are still likely to be supportive of the asset class over the medium-term. Global central bank accommodation has helped remove tail-risk scenarios and put a floor on global...

Europe Still Deciding: French Presidential Elections, April/May

With just under a week to go, the first round of the French presidential elections is upon us, and some worry it will follow in the footsteps of the political tsunamis of 2016. Until recently seemingly a two-horse race, the polls now suggest convergence on an almost-equal probability for each of the...

Why Tax Reform Lowers Interest Rates

Judging by financial market reaction and popular opinion, there is a strong consensus that prospective tax reform policies will lead to upward pressure on interest rates. We will argue here that the effects of reductions in marginal tax rates are at worst uncertain and that the presumption actually ...

As Fed Reinvestments End, New Opportunities Arise for Bond Investors

Through its first quantitative easing (QE) program, the Federal Reserve (Fed) began purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in November 2008 and US Treasuries (USTs) in March 2009. Since ending its third asset purchase program (QE3) in 2014, the Fed has continued to participate actively i...

Value and Diversification: Western Asset’s Philosophy in Action

Since our founding in 1971, Western Asset has grown to become one of the world’s leading fixed-income managers—yet our core philosophy remains unchanged. We believe in “value” and we believe in “diversification,” two tenets that are critical for success in meeting our clients’ investment objectives....

Europe Decides: Elections, 2017

After the political tsunamis of 2016—with the unexpected decisions by the British to leave the EU, and the Americans to elect Donald Trump president—the political nexus in 2017 shifts to the eurozone. The coming months herald parliamentary and presidential elections in the Netherlands, France and Ge...

Global Investing: The Price You Might Pay for Going Passive

We believe global bonds should have a role in your broad investment portfolio. The global bond market has grown dramatically over the past 20 years due to a number of secular forces and now offers investors a much richer universe of investment opportunities across a number of regions, sectors and cu...

A Tried and Trusted Way to Finance America’s Infrastructure Projects

Infrastructure may be the only area where bipartisan action by this Congress predictably can create large numbers of solid jobs, enhance growth and income opportunities for American investors, and help invigorate our economy. Our country needs...

Three Observations About the Federal Reserve in 2017

The surprise election of Donald Trump continues to be the focus for investors. The prospect of a new policy environment, and the various attendant risks, have led to a rethinking of economic forecasts and significant repricing across asset classes. The outlook for the Federal Reserve (Fed) is, of co...

The Western Asset Approach to Unconstrained Investing: An Overview

Unconstrained fixed-income investing has recently come into prominence due largely to two factors. First is investor desire to avoid having their portfolios tied to benchmarks whose composition may not reflect the optimal or desired components of their investment needs and objectives. The second ste...

Laying the Foundation for Housing Reform

Given the high degree of uncertainty around the agenda of the incoming Trump administration, Western Asset is focused on reviewing the implications of potential initiatives on the fixed-income markets and identifying value opportunities for client portfolios.  Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuch...

Scenario Analysis Process: US Presidential Election

On November 8, 2016, Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. The result was a shock to most, possibly including Mr. Trump. Most—although not all—opinion polls pointed to a Hillary Clinton win. Betting markets were even more unequivocally pro-Clinton. Prediction markets such as the I...

Is This as Good as It Gets for Corporate DB Plans?

Most corporate defined benefit (DB) plans continue to follow a risk-on strategy, positioned to benefit from rising stock prices and higher interest rates—a strategy that has not worked well for the last 20 years. In this paper, we suggest that hoping for funded status to improve via further stock pr...

Fixed-Income Managers Miss the POINT

On December 16, 2015, Barclays announced the sale of Barclays Risk Analytics and Index Solutions (BRAIS) to Bloomberg. The transaction has implications for the Barclays indices but more importantly it established an immovable deadline for many asset managers to find and implement a replacement for B...

In Bonds, Active Beats Passive

We believe your bond allocation is the place for active management. Since the financial crisis, passive flows into equities have accelerated and as of late they seem to have accelerated on the bond side of the equation as well. Buying inexpensive index performance may, on the surface, look like a go...

Convexity Complexity

Managing portfolio duration is a key focus for fixed-income portfolio managers. But active portfolio duration can change even when the portfolio manager does not make a deliberate choice to alter it. Our colleague Bonnie Wongtrakool has pointed out that changes in benchmark composition can cause imp...

Update: Italian Referendum on Constitutional Reform

On Sunday Italy goes to the polls to decide whether or not to back Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s constitutional reforms.

Investment Implications of the Upcoming Italian Referendum on Constitutional Reform

Italian bonds have experienced a spectacular rally since the eurozone crisis in late 2011. Despite the changing valuations, Western Asset has remained constructive.

US Economy Still a Long Way From Full Employment

With aggregate unemployment below 5%, it is commonly asserted that the US is at or close to full employment. The analysis behind such assertions concedes that sharp declines in labor force participation rates are the primary factor allowing unemployment rates to decline during this expansion, but th...

The Emerging Market Investor - Tourist or Pilgrim?

Of late, my vacation itinerary has steered clear of must-see tourist spots. The shift, while perhaps denying me some bragging rights, was prompted by the underwhelming feeling that inevitably sets in after actually visiting one of these iconic places. These sights seem to pale when compared to the v...

Jackson Hole: Is the Fed at a Crossroads?

A set of conflicting comments by Federal Reserve (Fed) members in the run up to Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s speech this Friday has raised questions about the direction of US monetary policy both through the end of the year and beyond. On the one hand, New York Fed President Bill Dudley said that, in hi...

Bonds Live to Die Another Day: Still One of the Best Diversifiers During Equity Weakness

In 2012 Gordon Stanger, a researcher from the Solomon Islands, went to the trouble of counting how many times Ian Fleming’s fictitious British Spy, James Bond, had been shot at. The number was 4662 times. He went one step further, ascribing a 5% probability of Bond receiving a fatal wound on each oc...














August 22, 2016
Market Commentary

I was recently asked, as part of a panel, to speak to the issue of the flattening yield curve. I pointed out that the yield curve is often known as the “Cassandra” of leading indicators. For those of you who remember your mythology, Cassandra’s fate was always to be right, but never to be believed. ...

How Mortgages Can Enhance Investment Returns

At $7.9 trillion in market value, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBS) comprise over 20% of the US fixed-income universe.

The Case for Municipal Bonds

The basic facts about municipal bonds are well known to investors: Their income is exempt from federal income tax—and some provide income that is exempt from specific state income taxes. They are generally of high quality. Their track record suggests defaults are extremely rare and bondholders remai...

Unconstrained Investing: Not Running on Empty by Any Means

Unconstrained investing is back in the spotlight. Once embraced by some investors and consultants as a magic bullet against rising US interest rates and as an opportunistic way to access new and growing segments of the global fixed-income universe, this approach is now generating some skepticism due...

Standing Our Ground: There Continues to Be Value in Credit

Since our webcast in early February, the credit rally has been nothing short of remarkable. More specifically, since February 11, 2016, US high-yield and US investment-grade markets have rallied 15.75% and 7.53% (as of July 6, 2016).  Our bullish view back in February was based on the belief that co...

What's Happening in the Commercial Real Estate and CMBS Market?

The fact that the UK on 23 June 2016 is embarking on a referendum on its membership of the EU for the second time in just over 40 years is symptomatic of its somewhat schizophrenic relationship with its neighbours.

A New Metric for Managing Pension Plans

It isn’t enough for an underfunded public pension plan just to achieve its expected return on assets target, it needs to beat that projected return handily. We present here a measure that reveals just how much asset return a plan needs to be able to discharge its pension obligations. This measure is...

DC Plans: It‘s Time to Fix Your Fixed-Income

The traditional fixed-income line-up offered by defined contribution (DC) plans may leave participants wanting given today’s low-yielding, financially repressed market environment. Investors in other channels, both institutional and retail, are seeking strategies that provide: 1) higher income 2) be...

The Obstacle Is The Path

Our contention remains that disappointing economic global growth will persist for the foreseeable future. As a result, we believe policymakers will commit even further to efforts designed to attenuate downside or systemic risk outcomes. The persistent undertow of tepid global growth juxtaposed again...

Emerging Markets Corporate Bonds: Seizing Opportunities in the 21st Century

Due to a number of positive economic and political factors, a significant reduction in sovereign risk in many emerging market (EM) countries over the last 15 years has allowed a deep, robust and liquid local government debt market to develop.

I’ll Take the Over

Those of you who have bet on football games understand the concept of the over/under bet. Essentially, the bookmakers (the market) estimate the total number of points likely to be scored in a game. Bettors (investors) can then bet the over if they believe the point total will be higher or the under ...

LDI and the Persistence of Tracking Error

Our defined-benefit (DB) pension clients have recently shown increased interest in pursuing liability driven investing (LDI) strategies to reduce the tracking error between their plan assets and the valuation of their liabilities. Substantial reduction in tracking error can be achieved by increasing...

Market Commentary

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, our investment thesis has been that the global recovery would prove to be enduring but extremely sluggish and that, despite anaemic growth, the risk premium due to systemic risk would slowly recede. Such a recovery would look something like two steps forward...

LDI and the Persistence of Tracking Error Appendix

In the white paper LDI and the Persistence of Tracking Error, we report the results of various hedging exercises involving both simple and complex LDI strategies.

New Solvency Regimes Promote Value Creation for Insurers

The Importance of Income Part 2: The Rule of 72

Most of us have learned the rule of 72 somewhere along the way in our financial careers. Simply stated, divide 72 by your expected annual return and the result will be the approximate time it will take for your investment to double. Historically, the 10% annualized return expectation for equities su...

Northern Rock Five Years On

Though it was neither the largest nor the most spectacular bank collapse of the global financial crisis (GFC), the September 14, 2007 fall of Northern Rock, a mid-sized regional UK bank (the only collapse to provoke a full-blown classic retail bank run) exposed all the faultlines of the GFC disaster...

A Note on Spread Risk and Capital Requirements for Insurers

A key component of an insurance company’s business is the management of spread risk in its general account investment portfolio. For bearing this risk, rating agencies and regulators establish capital requirements that vary with the level of risk, as measured by credit ratings. For example, in the U...

A Note on the Use of High-Yielding Fixed-Income Sectors for Insurers

The insurance industry continues to feel the impact of low interest rates on investment portfolio yields, product design, and reported profitability. Recently, Western Asset has written at length about fixed income sector opportunities to meet investors’ desire for higher yield and income in the cur...

Emerging Market High Yield: Understanding an Evolving Asset Class

There is a tendency among investors to see two asset classes they think of favorably—emerging markets (EM) and high-yield (HY)—and assume that the combination of the two will look and function like a faster-growth version of the US high-yield (US HY) market. A deeper look at the asset class, however...

Key Investment Ideas for 2012

2011 was certainly a historic year for investors. In addition to extremely high volatility, the year included an unprecedented downgrade of long-term US government debt, continued record-low yields in the US, the US debt-ceiling crisis, and questions about the future survival of the euro amid the so...

The Importance of Income

As investors, we know that income is an essential component of total return. Income clearly demonstrates its importance in the fixed-income market, but is also critically important in equities, real estate and currency investing. One of the key issues that investors must confront today is the prospe...

Fixed-Income Portfolio Benchmarks: Time for Re-evaluation?

Equal Footing: Financing Single-Family Rentals

Short-Dated High-Yield Strategy

In a low-rate environment, more high-yield companies are looking to refinance their bonds to a lower coupon level. How can an investor potentially profit from this trend? Western Asset’s Short-Dated High-Yield strategy targets bonds that are more likely to be tendered before their first call date—at...

Will the US Government Default on Its Debt?

There has been substantial coverage of the possible default of US Treasuries (UST) in the media and by Wall Street analysts. This discussion is driven by the need for politicians to raise the limit on issuance of US federal debt (e.g., UST). In 1917, the US Congress1 created a law that gave it the a...

How Would a US Downgrade Impact Emerging Markets?

Moody’s warning on Wednesday, July 13, that the US might lose its AAA rating as a result of the debt ceiling issue has prompted some questions regarding the impact of such a development on emerging markets. We believe that this “noise” has been with us for quite some time. Moreover, major structural...

Introduction to High-Yield Bond Covenants

In our January 2011 US High-Yield Investment Report, we wrote, “We believe that high-yield managers will differentiate themselves during 2011 through issuer selection.” We expected that volatility would decline, performance disparities between rating and industry categories would be fairly muted, an...

A New Year’s Investing Resolution: Get Active...

As we embark on a new investing year, we are hearing concerns from investors regarding their fixed-income allocations.

Principles of Investment Risk Management

A stylized fact in the investment business is that whenever you hear someone say “it’s different this time,” you should be very cautious. Because that’s usually a sign that the speaker thinks that unbreakable rules can be broken—that this time, trees will grow to the skies. So let’s start out by say...

Foreclosure Moratoria in the News

There have been a multitude of news stories over the past few weeks discussing foreclosure moratoria actions taken by several banks in various states across the country.

Emerging Markets:  Navigating the Rising Tide of Global Liquidity

Capital is pouring into emerging markets. For those who remember the “boom and bust” cycles of the 1980s and 1990s, this is nothing new. However, the catalysts that fostered the gradual build-up and rapid reversal of foreign capital inflows during those periods are markedly different from those driv...

Emerging Markets: Revisiting the Investment Thesis in an Era of Debt

"One thing that is clear is that the structure of the world economy is changing in important ways, with effects that are difficult to predict. The past may no longer be a good guide to the future and relying too much on conventional wisdom—either old or new—may be dangerous.” —Brookings Institution,...

China’s Exchange-Rate Regime

The highly anticipated shift in China’s exchange rate regime was finally announced, although it seemed a statement of intent rather than a roadmap for future policy.  While details remain thin, it seems likely that China will re-introduce the crawling peg that existed from July 2005 until July 2008,...

The Real Message of LDI

By now, liability-driven investing (LDI) has become a household name among defined-benefit pension (DB) plans worldwide. Major DB global accounting and regulatory reforms occurred some years ago, making DB plans more acutely aware of the short-term volatility in their funded balance, and we have sin...

Active Equity and Passive Bonds? Revisited

Some commentators are recommending that investors restrict fixed-income allocations to passive mandates, confining active management to equities or alternatives. In a 2009 white paper,1 “Active Equity and Passive Bonds?”, we pointed out that in order for such an approach to be advisable, information...

Emerging Market Debt: Think Local, Trade Global

Emerging-market debt has outperformed many major asset classes on a risk-adjusted basis over the past 15 years (Exhibit 1).

Active Equity and Passive Bonds?

Some analysts currently recommend that institutions move to passive-only exposure in fixed-income while maintaining active management in equities. In order for such tactics to be advisable, an investor should have a firm conviction that positive active returns—or alpha—can be reliably obtained in eq...

Is It Time to Rebalance?

With the broad stock market down nearly 50% since December 2007, some institutional investors are considering rebalancing their portfolios, shifting fixed-income allocations to equities to re-attain the equity exposure they would normally target (that exposure having declined because of the drop in ...

Credit: An Historic Opportunity

The past two years have comprised the worst period on record for the investment-grade credit market in terms of relative return versus U.S. Treasuries. The asset class generated 2,442 basis points (bps) of negative excess return for the two-year period ending January 22, 2009, a beating well beyond ...

Engineering LDI: Circumspect Pension Planning

When a pension plan practices liability-driven investing, it matches the risks of plan assets to those of plan liabilities. The plan recognizes that its true risks arise from movements in assets relative to liabilities, and so it manages the risks of its funded balance (assets minus liabilities), no...














May 1, 2007
The Right Way to Use Long-Duration Swaps in LDI

It is common Liability Driven Investing (LDI) practice among U.S. defined-benefit pension plans to utilize interest rate swaps to “remove” interest rate sensitivity (duration) from the plan’s funded balance. For virtually all these plans, the bulk of assets remain allocated to equities or to other h...

U.S. Pension Reform One Year Later

In the past year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has published initial phases of a reform of accounting standards for U.S. corporate pension plans, and Congress has enacted reforms of funding regulations for plans insured by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC). The FASB...

Effective LDI: When Do Bond Swaps Help?

Your company’s defined-benefit pension plan features an asset allocation heavily concentrated in equities. It has been proposed that you overlay the portfolio with a long-duration interest rate swap, so as to eliminate interest rate risks from your plan. Is this a good idea? Probably not.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments are subject to risks, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments are subject to credit risk, inflation risk, and interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the Fund's share price. The Fund may invest in lower-rated high yield bonds which are subject to greater credit risk (risk of default) than higher-rated obligations. Investments in foreign securities involve risks, including the possibility of losses due to changes in currency exchange rates and negative developments in the political, economic, or regulatory structure of specific countries or regions. These risks are greater in emerging markets. Leverage may result in greater volatility of NAV and the market price of common shares and increases a shareholder's risk of loss. The Fund may make significant investments in derivative instruments. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price or NAV, and assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price or NAV, respectively. Prior to January 1, 2012, returns based on NAV assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.
 
Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
 
Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund’s NAV. 



























A NOTE ABOUT FEES & EXPENSES: Based on the Fund’s net assets of the common shares, as of the most recent Annual Report.
Management fees: Under the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an annual fee, paid monthly, as a portion of the Fund's average daily Managed Assets. “Managed Assets” are defined as net assets plus the amount of any borrowing, including loans from certain financial institutions and/or the issuance of debt securities (collectively, “Borrowings”), and assets attributable to any preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) that may be outstanding. Please see the fund’s Annual Report for more information on expenses.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS INFORMATION: Portfolio characteristics and holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. 

Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
 


Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Distributions 






Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the performance section on this page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section below. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment.

These materials and any tax-related statements are not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used or relied upon, by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties. Tax-related statements, if any, may have been written in connection with the "promotion or marketing" of the transaction(s) or matter(s) addressed by these materials, to the extent allowed by applicable law.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested.
