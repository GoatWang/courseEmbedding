International incorporation can be fraught with opacity, anxiety and vulnerability - especially if it is being done remotely as we did. Healy Consultants worked really hard to make it transparent, straight forward and confidence-inspiring. I look forward to working with Healey Consultants again on future work and happily recommend them to others." Fiona Thompson, Managing Director  Pirster Pte.  "We had taken Healy Consultants assistance in incorporating our entities in some of the complicated jurisdictions. Their approach right from the beginning has been very systematic, clear and efficient. It has been a pleasure to work with all of them." Mr. Aniket Chatterjee, Senior Manager - Operations & Compliance  Zomato Pvt. Ltd.  "Healy Consultants did an excellent job helping me navigate the legal and accounting rules and regulations to set up a company in Taiwan." Peter Rooks, President  Phoenics Electronics  "Thank you Healy Consultants for swiftly project managing my engagement. From the moment I met you in Singapore Healy Consultants attended to my requirements and specific needs.  I am more than satisfied with your service. Moreover, your  weekly updates allowed me to continue to focus my attention on my global business while trusting you to deliver as promised." Shakeel Alibhai,  Fervor Montreal  "Thank you Healy Consultants, you were instrumental in setting up of my Hong Kong based company, the whole process was completed in a professional and timely manner." Terry Skews, CEO  Brittany Offshore Limited  "Healy Consultants, a professionally managed firm with clear understanding and knowledge about what client expects from them and delivers the same in a professional and timely manner. Kudos to their team." Pramod Dubey, Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary  Accutest Research Laboratories (India) Private Limited  "Incorporating any company is comparable to setting the foundation blocks of your new company building, which you aim to build in the best location available. By choosing Healy Consultants you are laying the perfect foundations." Steve Hauxwell, Managing Director  Natural Resource Professionals Pte Limited.  "The one word that defines Healy Consultants is perfect professionalism. If you have Healy to set up your business abroad, you could focus on the operational overhead and let Healy take care of the rest. From Incorporation to Taxation, it’s a one stop solution. Rest assured, you will have the best people in the Industry working for you and providing you with the best possible information and suggestions." Raja Chakraborty, Director  Streamlyn Pte. Ltd.  "Thank you Healy Consultants for successfully project managing our business set up in Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar and Bahrain." Steve Louw, UK General Counsel  JLL Group  "When it was time to establish a Space Academy in Singapore, TriVector needed a knowledgeable firm that could not only help us establish our infrastructure, but could also advise on the local and regional business climate. Healy was that firm, which is why we've been satisfied Healy Consultants for almost five years now." Timothy F Kauffman, CEO  Trivector Services  "Finding the right partner was critical for VESL’s expansion in Asia and working with Healy Consultants has made this possible." Gary Webb, Managing Director  VESL  "Healy Consultants accounting and tax support is invaluable." Chris Vorwerg, Managing Director  WinPCS  "Healy Consultants were instrumental in the set up of our company. They have continued to provide exceptional support and advice over the years." Susan Gunnery, Managing Director  Qudoss Group  "Healy Consultants is the best firm that we have ever worked with. Through our entire business relationship we were satisfied with provided level of quality and services. Healy Consultants have been responsive and detail oriented which has allowed us to stay focused on our business and not getting distracted with small details." Nikolay Evdokimov, Director  Appintop Echange Pte Ltd Home » China » Business entities in China  Business entities in ChinaBusiness entities in ChinaAs the largest market in the world by the size of its population, the People’s Republic of China is an attractive place for business setup by foreigners. Starting a company in China is however complex and time-consuming, due to i) rapidly evolving and inconsistent regulations ii) the need to contact different administrations and agencies and iii) restrictions to foreign investment in several industries. Healy Consultants will however make it easier for our Clients to invest in China by advising them on the appropriate location and legal entity for their venture in China and then completing on their behalf all procedures required to establish their business.Doing business in China with a local entityThe China wholly foreign owned enterprise (WFOE) The most popular entity in China is the China wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE), that is to say a Chinese limited liability company wholly owned by foreign investor(s). A Chinese WFOE can generate income from all industries opened to foreign investment, and is also subject to Chinese taxation. The following information will help you determine whether registering a WFOE in China is the optimum corporate structure to fulfil your business objectives in this country:Best uses:A Chinese WFOE can conduct manufacturing operations in China, invest in other companies and also trade products, services and raw material internationally. Unlike local companies, conversion of RMB earnings to US dollars by a WFOE for remittance to its parent company outside of China is not restricted by Law nor penalized by withholding tax;A Chinese WFOE can also be allowed to engage in wholesale and retail trade with Chinese customers, in which case such entity is sometimes also known as a “foreign invested commercial enterprise” (FICE), subject to minor differences during the registration procedures.Main requirements to form a Chinese WFOE:Registration requirementsDepending on the city of registration, the minimum share capital required ranges between US$15,000 and US$140,000. To optimize the probability of timely China WFOE registration, Healy Consultants recommends our Clients to have a registered capital of US$140,000. The paid-up capital required before registration would then be 20% (US$28,000) of the registered capital, while the balance must be deposited to the bank account within 2 years. Healy Consultants will advise our Clients regarding the optimum paid up share capital strategy;All foreign-invested enterprises in China (including WFOE) must go through a complex approval process by the authorities including: i) pre-approval of a business plan by the China National Development and Reform Commission ii) incorporation approval by the PRC Ministry of Commerce and iii) foreign exchange registration with China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange;A feasibility study must be submitted to the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC). This document includes a basic first year business plan and budget. The project will not be approved unless the local authorities are convinced it is a feasible business. Government approval of the project/business activities is an integral part of the incorporation process. If the project is not approved, incorporation is disallowed.Post-registration requirementsAfter setup of the Chinese company, all businesses must register for i) corporate income tax ii) VAT and iii) social security (if they have employees). They are thereafter required to file i) corporate income returns and provisional payments each quarter ii) VAT returns and payments usually each quarter and iii) social security contributions each month;Furthermore, after incorporation, all Chinese companies (foreign-invested or not) are required to report to the Tax Administration Department monthly, quarterly and annually. If needed, Healy Consultants assists our Clients minimize the burden constituted by reporting requirements, by taking care on their behalf of accounting and tax reporting obligations.The China free zone companyForeigners can form a wholly foreign owned company and register it in one of China’s numerous special economic zones (SEZ), provided that their business is export-oriented. Minimum requirements will vary from one zone to another and usually include a minimum number of job created, minimum capital requirements and, in some cases, technology transfers. Some SEZs provide a one stop shop for registration of the entity, while others follow standard WFOE procedures;For further information on special economic zones’ advantages and business setup requirements, refer to our China free zone page;Best uses: A China free zone company is an optimal entity for an export-oriented manufacturing business.The China joint venture company (equity joint venture)A China joint venture company (also known as a China equity joint venture or an EJV) is commonly a standard limited liability company established by i) one foreigner (our Client) and ii) one Chinese joint venture partner;Like foreign-owned China LLCs, China EJVs will be required to i) appoint a resident company secretary ii) open a corporate bank account with a local bank and iii) obtain approvals for all registrations required by a China WOFE. Setting up a China joint venture company will however be more complex than an LLC, as our Client will face i) higher share capital requirements and ii) longer licensing delays;Best uses: the registration of a joint venture company usually corresponds to a Government requirement limiting foreign ownership in companies operating in a list of around 35 industries, notably including i) the automobile industry ii) legal consulting services and iii) tobacco products. Joint venture company setup may also be requested by some of our Clients, willing to benefit from the specialist local knowledge of their PRC partner.Doing business in China with a foreign entityThe China branch officePractically, companies registered outside of China are not permitted to establish branch offices. Foreign investors are only allowed to register branch offices for their wholly foreign owned entity or equity joint venture in China;Best uses: the use of a branch office is to expand the geographical reach of their existing business entities in China. Investors may register a branch office to bid for local provincial projects.The China representative officeChinese regulations allow foreign companies to open representative offices in China. While representative office registration follow simpler procedures than LLCs and branches as they usually only require approval from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, they are not allowed to pursue production-related or commercial activities in China;Best uses: A representative office can be used when our Client is not seeking to conduct any productive or commercial operations in China.The China offshore companyA China offshore company is a Hong Kong company. As Hong Kong is part of the Chinese territory but subject to a different taxation system, registering a company in Hong Kong can assist our Client to oversee his productive and commercial activities in China. See this page for further details on how this corporate solution can assist to do business in China;Best uses: A Hong Kong company can be used as the international trading arm of a mainland Chinese business, as well as a holding vehicle facilitating investment in China and repatriation of earnings overseas.Table comparing different business entitiesOperations and logisticsWFOEFree zone companyEJVBranchROOffshoreDoing business in China permitted?YesYesYesYesNoNoAllowed to sign contracts with local Clients?YesYesYesYesNoYesAllowed to invoice local Clients?YesYesYesYesNoYesMust rent local office premises?YesYesYesYesYesNoAllowed to import raw materials?YesYesYesYesYesNoAllowed to export goods?YesYesYesYesYesNoAccounting and taxChina corporate tax on local income?25%25%25%25%N/AN/ACorporate tax on foreign income?25%25%25%25%N/AN/ACorporate bank account?HSBC ChinaHSBC ChinaHSBC ChinaHSBC ChinaHSBC ChinaHSBC HKStatutory audit requiredYesYesYesYesYesYesAnnual tax return to be submitted?YesYesYesYesYesYesAccess to DTAAs?YesYesYesYesNoNoCompany lawIssued share capital required?US$15,000US$15,000US$400NoneNoneUS$1Resident director required?NoNoNoNoNoNoPRC shareholder required?NoNoYesNoNoNoMinimum number of directors?111111Minimum number of shareholders?112Parent companyParent company1Individual shareholders allowed?YesYesYesNoNoYesCorporate shareholders allowed?YesYesYesYesYesYesPublic register of shareholders and directorsYesYesYesYesYesYesImmigrationCan the entity hire expatriate staff in PRC?YesYesYesYesYesNoHow long to get work permit approved3 months3 months3 months3 months3 monthsN/AFeesEstimate of engagement costsUS$16,650US$15,650US$15,650US$18,350US$17,650US$6,655Draft invoice External videos Foreign investment in ChinaReform 3.0: China’s Next DirectionContact usFor additional information on our business setup services in China, please email us at email@healyconsultants.com.

Types of business presence in China:
Last Updated: July 23, 2017
Foreign Investors generally establish a business presence in China in 
        one of five ways: 1. WFOE, 2. Representative Office, 3. Joint Venture, 
        4. Partnership Enterprise (PE) and 
        5. Hong Kong company. 6. Shanghai Free-Trade Zone company. The differences 
        between each of these are summarized below, you can also check the Comparison 
        Chart. and ( Download 
        our contributed article to a famous London-based publishing house about 
        the options)
 WHOLLY FOREIGN OWNED ENTERPRISE (WFOE) is 
        a limited liability company wholly owned by the foreign investor. A WFOE 
        requires registered capital and its liability is limited to its equity 
        , it can generate income, pays tax in China and its profit can be repatriate 
        back to the investor's home country. Any limited liability enterprise 
        in China which is 100% owned by a foreign company, individual(s) or companies 
        can be called as WFOE.
 REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE (RO) is a liaison office 
        of its parent company. It requires no registered capital. Its activities 
        are limited to : product or service promotion, market research of parent 
        company's business, quality control or contact liaison in China. A RO 
        is generally prohibited from generating any revenue nor entering into 
        contracts with local businesses in China.
FOREIGN INVESTED PARTNERSHIP ENTERPRISE 
        (FIPE)  for foreign investor is a new type of business presence in 
        China (since March 1, 2010). It refers to: a) 2 or more Foreign enterprises 
        or individuals establish a Partnership Enterprise (PE) in China; and b) 
        Foreign enterprise(s) or individual(s) with Chinese individual or company 
        establish a Partnership Enterprise (PE) in China. It's a new type of business 
        entity in China, and with very little capital, partners could start a 
        business in China easily, there's no minimum registered capital required 
        for FIPE. Same as WFOE, FIPE could generating revenue, hire local and 
        foreign staffs and entering into contracts with local and overseas businesses 
        in China
JOINT VENTURE (JV) is a limited liability company 
        formed between a Chinese company investor and a Foreign investor. The 
        parties agree to create a entity by both contributing equity, and they 
        then share in the revenues, expenses, and control of the enterprise. A 
        JV has usually been used by foreign investors to enter the restricted 
        in industries such as: Education, Entertainment, Mining, Hospital etc. 
      
HONG KONG COMPANY 
        it's often be used as a Special Purpose vehicle (SPV) to invest in 
        Mainland China. Hong Kong is one of the quickest locations to Incorporate 
        a business. Although a HK company is not a legal entity in mainland China 
        (see Wiki 1 
        country, 2 systems), many foreign investors, especially investors 
        from Europe and North America choose to form a Hong Kong company as a 
        SPV to invest in China.
 SHANGHAI 
        FREE-TRADE ZONE COMPANY (FTZ) The Shanghai free-trade zone is one of the 
        first in mainland China.This free-trade zone including three bonded zones: 
        Waigaoqiao port, Yangshan Deep-Water Port and Pudong International Airport, 
        covering a total of 28 square kilometers 
 Customs formalities within the free-trade zone will be simple and convenient 
        that the entry of goods will only require registration of the variety 
        and value of the goods without any inspection and intervention, there 
        will be no declaration process for goods coming in and out of the zone.according 
        to Mr. Huang Shengqiang, director general of Shanghai Customs.
 Iit was establishing a pilot zone in Shanghai to test some of the government’s 
        financial overhauls, including interest rate liberalization and full convertibility 
        of China’s currency, the renminbi. 
 The zone will take more than 10 years to construct. Upon completion, 
        the free trade zone will provide world-class transport and communications 
        facilities, as well as a tax-free environment for domestic and foreign 
        enterprises who consider Shanghai to be a major hub of their supply chains 
        across Asia.
The pilot program includes several steps. It will create tax-friendly 
        facilities for trade and investment within the free trade zone, promote 
        China's interest-rate liberalization and, eventually, Renminbi convertibility. 
        It will also encourage financial product innovation and promote the development 
        of offshore businesses. The program is set to play an important part in 
        the negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) and 
        become the first open window to help China join the TPP.
Statistics released by the Shanghai Municipal Office for Port Services 
        showed that Shanghai's foreign trade cargo handling capacity accumulated 
        to 306 million tons in 2012, an increase of 5.9 percent over the same 
        period during the previous year, ranking first in the world in terms of 
        cargo and container management capacities.
The creation of a Shanghai free trade zone is the Chinese government's 
        latest major initiative in adapting to global economic development trends 
        and furthering its opening up to the outside world. It is conducive to 
        cultivating new advantages for China in the face of global competition. 
        Moreover, it will help build a new platform for its cooperation with other 
        countries and regions, develop new space for economic growth and build 
        an “upgraded version” of the Chinese economy.

Partnership Agreement - Sample Contracts and Business Forms 















HomeSample Business ContractsBy Contract TypePartnership Agreement 


 Partnership Agreement A partnership agreement is used to form a general partnership or a limited liability partnership (LLP). This agreement sets forth the partnership name, its purpose, and how it will be managed. Additionally, the partners should state how the partnership will be capitalized, how profits and losses will be allocated, and what restrictions will be placed on the transfer of interest in the partnership. If the parties elect to terminate the partnership, the agreement should state how the partnership may be dissolved, and what procedures need to be followed to wind up and liquidate the partnership.
