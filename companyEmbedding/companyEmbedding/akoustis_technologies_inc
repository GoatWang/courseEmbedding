 SMART SELECTIVITY SOLUTIONS 



 ABOUT US 
 



Founded in 2014 by experienced industry leaders and scientists from University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Cornell University, Akoustis’ mission is to commercialize and manufacture its patented BulkONE® acoustic wave technology to address the critical frequency-selectivity requirements in today’s mobile smartphones – improving the efficiency and signal quality of Mobile Wireless devices and enabling The Internet of Things (IoT).
The Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filter market is rapidly expanding, driven by growth in 4G/LTE and the number of filters required per device. BAW filters have evolved as the key differentiator in the RF wireless frontend, as nearly half of the RF power generated by the PA is subsequently dissipated as heat in the filter. As a result, the power amplifier must be over-designed (by as much as 2x) to accommodate for this filter loss, increasing the cost of the frontend, negatively impacting the front end thermal management, and ultimately, reducing battery life. Furthermore, such frontend losses contribute to human-tissue heating when the mobile device is held against the head or attached to the body (in the case of wearable RF devices).
Akoustis® addresses this critical mobile-wireless need by using single crystal piezoelectric materials to create a new class of acoustic wave filters – improving performance, lowering cost and driving miniaturization. Akoustis’ Bulk ONE® filters originate from materials which exhibit 30% better acoustic performance when compared to the incumbent thin-film technologies deployed today.”

           Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain
           Officers.




Chief Financial Officer Transition
On July 14, 2017, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Akoustis Technologies,
Inc. (the "Company") elected John T. Kurtzweil to serve as its Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, effective immediately. As previously
reported in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 26, 2017 (the "Previous Form 8-K"),
Cindy C. Payne, the Company's then Chief Financial Officer, notified the Company
on May 22, 2017 of her intention to step down from her position as Chief
Financial Officer. Ms. Payne's resignation became effective on July 14, 2017
upon Mr. Kurtzweil's election. Pursuant to the offer letter, filed as Exhibit
10.1 to the Previous Form 8-K, Ms. Payne now serves as the Company's Vice
President of Finance. Effective July 14, 2017, Ms. Payne also serves as the
Company's Corporate Controller.
Mr. Kurtzweil, age 60, has served as a director on the Board since January 12,
2017. He served as VP Finance of Cree, Inc., a company that develops,
manufactures, and sells lighting-class light emitting diode, lighting, and
semiconductor products for power and radio-frequency applications, and Chief
Financial Officer of Wolfspeed, a Cree Company, from 2015 until March 2017. He
is currently providing consulting services to a number of businesses. Prior to
his employment at Cree, Mr. Kurtzweil was an independent consultant beginning in
2014. From 2012 until 2014, Mr. Kurtzweil served as Senior Vice President, Chief
Financial Officer and Special Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer of Extreme
Networks, Inc., a provider of high-performance, open networking innovations for
enterprises, services providers, and Internet exchanges, and also served as its
Chief Accounting Officer. From 2006 to 2012, Mr. Kurtzweil served as Executive
Vice President, Finance and as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Cree,
Inc. From 2004 to 2006, Mr. Kurtzweil was Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer at Cirrus Logic, Inc., a fabless semiconductor company. Mr.
Kurtzweil currently serves as a director of Axcelis Technology, Inc., and was
appointed Chairman of its Audit Committee in February 2017. Mr. Kurtzweil served
as a board member for Meru Networks, Inc. for a portion of 2015 prior to its
acquisition.
Mr. Kurtzweil's industry experience includes several M&A transactions and, when
combined with his treasury experience, gives him a valuable perspective as Chief
Financial Officer. His qualifications to serve as Chief Financial Officer also
include that he is a certified public accountant and certified management
accountant, his financial market experience, training through the Stanford
Directors College and his active membership with the National Association of
Corporate Directors.
There are no family relationships between Mr. Kurtzweil and any other executive
officer or director of the Company, nor is the Company aware of any
relationships or transactions in which Mr. Kurtzweil has or will have an
interest, or is or was a party, requiring disclosure under Item 404(a) of
Regulation S-K. Upon joining the Board in January 2017, Mr. Kurtzweil received
22,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common
Stock") under the Company's 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). These shares
will continue to vest 25% on each of the first, second, third, and fourth
anniversaries of the grant date pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the award
agreement.
In connection with his election to Chief Financial Officer of the Company, Mr.
Kurtzweil has resigned from the Board, including from his positions on the
Board's Audit Committee (including form his position as Chairman of the Audit
Committee), Compensation Committee, and Nominating Committee. The Company
expects to announce the appointment of a new director soon.
On July 17, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing Mr. Kurtzweil's
election to Chief Financial Officer. The full text of the press release is
attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Chief Financial Officer Employment Agreement
In connection with his election to Chief Financial Officer of the Company, Mr.
Kurtzweil and the Company entered into an employment agreement, dated July 14,
2017 (the "Employment Agreement"), pursuant to which Mr. Kurtzweil will receive
an annual base salary of $151,000, which is subject to increases or decreases at
the Board's sole discretion, monthly living expenses of $1,600, three weeks of
paid vacation each year, and reimbursement for all reasonable business,
promotional, travel, and entertainment expenses incurred in the performance of
his duties. In addition, Mr. Kurtzweil is also eligible to earn a target annual
bonus each fiscal year equal to 70% of his annual base salary, based on certain
Company operation, financial, and other milestones set by the Board and/or its
Compensation Committee. Mr. Kurtzweil is also entitled to participate in any
employee benefit plans and programs generally provided by the Company to its
senior executives from time to time. In addition, as an inducement to
employment, Mr. Kurtzweil will receive the equity awards described under "Chief
Financial Officer Equity Awards" below.
The term of the Employment Agreement extends through July 31, 2018, and the
Employment Agreement will automatically renew for successive one year periods
unless either party gives at least 30 days written notice of non-renewal to the
other party prior to the end of the then applicable term.
If Mr. Kurtzweil's employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by
Mr. Kurtzweil for "good reason" (each as defined in the Employment Agreement),
Mr. Kurtzweil will be entitled to receive: (1) continued payment of his base
salary, payable in bi-weekly installments, for 12 months; (2) his annual bonus
for the preceding year, if and to the extent earned and not already paid; (3)
any other compensation and benefits accrued through the date of termination; and
(4) reimbursement for one year after the date of termination for the cost of
committed living allowance expenses and any COBRA continuation of health
coverage if he elects such coverage. Any unvested stock options, restricted
stock awards, or other equity awards granted by the Company to Mr. Kurtzweil
will vest or be forfeited in accordance with the terms of the applicable award
agreement(s).
If Mr. Kurtzweil's employment is terminated due to his death or "disability" (as
defined in the Employment Agreement), if the Company terminates Mr. Kurtzweil's
employment for "cause," or if Mr. Kurtzweil voluntarily terminates his
employment without "good reason," Mr. Kurtzweil, his designated beneficiary, or
his estate, as applicable, will be entitled to receive his base salary accrued
through the date of termination. In the case of termination due to "disability"
or Mr. Kurtzweil's voluntary termination of employment, he will also be entitled
to receive his annual bonus for the preceding year, if and to the extent earned
and not already paid. Any unvested stock options, restricted stock awards, or
other equity awards granted by the Company to Mr. Kurtzweil will vest or be
forfeited in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement(s).
Mr. Kurtzweil is also subject to various restrictive covenants, and his
entitlement to certain benefits is contingent upon his compliance with such
covenants. Specifically, Mr. Kurtzweil is subject to a covenant not to disclose
the Company's confidential information, a covenant not to compete during his
employment and for a period of one year following termination of his employment,
a covenant not to solicit the Company's customers and employees during his
employment and for a period of one year following termination of his employment,
and a reciprocal non-disparagement covenant during his employment and at all
times thereafter.
The Employment Agreement also includes an acknowledgment by Mr. Kurtzweil of the
Company's ownership of work products which are created, designed, conceived, or
developed by Mr. Kurtzweil during his employment and a warranty by Mr. Kurtzweil
to indemnify and hold harmless the Company in the event he breaches any
obligation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and any rules promulgated by the SEC and other
applicable federal, state, or foreign laws, rules, regulations, or orders.
The foregoing summary of the Employment Agreement is not complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Employment
Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated
herein by reference.
Chief Financial Officer Equity Awards
Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, Mr. Kurtzweil will receive a restricted
stock award for 100,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Restricted Stock Award")
and options for 75,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Option" and, together with
the Restricted Stock Award, the "Awards") during the Company's next open trading
window. The Awards will be granted under the Plan and will vest 25% on each of
the first, second, third, and fourth anniversaries of the grant date, subject to
Mr. Kurtzweil's continued employment and the terms and conditions of the Plan
and the applicable award agreements in a form established by the Compensation
Committee of the Board.
If Mr. Kurtzweil's employment is terminated for any reason other than
termination by the Company without "cause," by Mr. Kurtzweil for "good reason,"
or due to Mr. Kurtzweil's death or "disability" (each as defined in the
Employment Agreement), which death or "disability" occurred during the
performance of Mr. Kurtzweil's duties as an employee of the Company (provided
that Mr. Kurtzweil was not negligent in the performance of such duties), and all
or any part of the Awards has not vested, been earned, or become exercisable, as
applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the applicable award
agreement, the Awards, to the extent not then vested or earned, will be
forfeited immediately upon such termination.
If Mr. Kurtzweil's employment is terminated by the Company without "cause," by
Mr. Kurtzweil for "good reason," or due to Mr. Kurtzweil's death or "disability"
(each as defined in the Employment Agreement), which death or "disability"
occurred during the performance of Mr. Kurtzweil's duties as an employee of the
Company (provided that Mr. Kurtzweil was not negligent in the performance of
such duties), any part of the Awards that has not vested, been earned, or become
exercisable, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the applicable
award agreement will be deemed earned and vested as of the termination date,
provided that Mr. Kurtzweil agrees not to sell, transfer, assign, pledge, or
otherwise encumber the shares subject to the Restricted Stock Award and the
shares underlying the Option (other than by will or the laws of intestate
succession or to cover withholding tax obligations) until the Restricted Stock
Award or the Option, as applicable, would have otherwise vested.
In the event of a "change of control" (as defined in the Plan), if the successor
or surviving company does not assume or substitute the Awards on substantially
similar terms or with substantially equivalent economic benefits as the Awards,
the Awards will become fully vested, earned, payable, and exercisable, as
applicable, to the fullest extent of the original grant as of the date of the
"change of control." If the Awards are substituted, assumed, or continued by the
successor or surviving company on substantially similar terms or with
substantially equivalent economic benefits, but Mr. Kurtzweil is terminated by
the Company or an affiliate without "cause" or for "good reason" (each as
defined in the Plan) within two years after the effective date of the "change of
control," the Awards will become fully vested.
The foregoing summary of the Awards is not complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Restricted Stock Award
Agreement and the form of Option Agreement, as applicable, to be entered into by
Mr. Kurtzweil and the Company during the next open trading window, copies of
which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and
incorporated herein by reference.

- Steve Miller's Company Sawtek was Acquired by TriQuint Semiconductors in 2001 for ~ $1.3 Billion -

Charlotte, N.C., July  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akoustis Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKTS) ("Akoustis" or the "Company"), a manufacturer of patented single-crystal BulkONE® bulk acoustic wave (BAW) high-band RF filters for mobile and other wireless applications, announced today the appointment of Steve Miller as an independent member of its Board of Directors. His addition brings the total number of directors to seven.

















Akoustis, Inc.










 
Mr. Miller, age 69, is widely considered to be a pioneer in the RF filter industry, having co-founded Sawtek Inc. in 1979. Sawtek designed and manufactured surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters that were primarily used in defense systems, cable television hardware and later in cellular base stations and smartphones. Mr. Miller served as Sawtek's President and later as the CEO and Chairman for a total of 22 years and grew Sawtek into a leading independent supplier of SAW devices. Sawtek was acquired in 2001 by TriQuint Semiconductors for approximately $1.3 Billion, where Steve subsequently served on the TriQuint board through 2003. In January 2015, TriQuint and RF Micro Devices combined in a merger of equals creating the existing company, Qorvo, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRVO). Prior to founding Sawtek, Steve worked at Texas Instruments where he developed surface acoustic wave devices for military and space applications.
 
"We are thrilled to have Steve join the Board", said Jerry Neal, Co-Chairman of Akoustis. Mr. Neal continued, "Steve is a tough-minded executive who knows what it takes to develop and grow an RF filter business from inception to a value of over $1 Billion. His technology and industry insight, business experience and guidance will be a valuable addition to the Akoustis Board."
 
Mr. Miller commented, "I am pleased to have an opportunity to assist Akoustis in growing the company into a BAW filter market leader and executing a strategy that creates long-term value for shareholders."
 
Akoustis is pioneering next-generation material science to address the market requirements for improved RF filters - targeting higher bandwidth, higher operating frequencies and higher output power compared to incumbent polycrystalline BAW technology deployed today. Superior performance is driven by the significant advances of high-purity, single-crystal piezoelectric materials and the resonator-filter process technology. The advanced material properties drive electro-mechanical coupling, which translates to wide filter bandwidth. High-band RF filters are achieved by leveraging the Company's high-sound velocity, single-crystal piezoelectric materials. These single-crystal piezoelectric materials offer high-thermal conductivity along the path of heat flow, enabling high-power handling capability of the RF filter.
 
About Akoustis Technologies, Inc.
Akoustis® (http://www.akoustis.com) is a high-tech RF filter solutions company that designs and manufactures its unique, patented BulkONE® technology to produce single-crystal bulk acoustic wave (BAW) RF filters for mobile and other wireless markets, which facilitate signal acquisition and accelerate band performance between the antenna and digital back end.  Its BulkONE® technology will service the fast growing multi-billion dollar market of device OEMs, network providers, and consumers to diminish Front End phone heat, battery drain and signal loss -- all considered to be directly related to current RF polycrystalline filter technologies' limitations.  Akoustis' capital-efficient business model leverages new and existing investments in manufacturing infrastructure within the semiconductor industry. The Company owns and operates a 120,000 sq. ft. ISO-9001 certified commercial wafer-manufacturing facility located in Canandaigua, NY, which includes a state-of-the-art class 100 / class 1000 cleanroom facility - tooled for 150-mm diameter - for the design, development, fabrication and packaging of RF filters, MEMS and semiconductor devices. Akoustis is headquartered in the Piedmont technology corridor between Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina.

 SMART SELECTIVITY SOLUTIONS 



 ABOUT US 
 



Founded in 2014 by experienced industry leaders and scientists from University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Cornell University, Akoustis’ mission is to commercialize and manufacture its patented BulkONE® acoustic wave technology to address the critical frequency-selectivity requirements in today’s mobile smartphones – improving the efficiency and signal quality of Mobile Wireless devices and enabling The Internet of Things (IoT).
The Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filter market is rapidly expanding, driven by growth in 4G/LTE and the number of filters required per device. BAW filters have evolved as the key differentiator in the RF wireless frontend, as nearly half of the RF power generated by the PA is subsequently dissipated as heat in the filter. As a result, the power amplifier must be over-designed (by as much as 2x) to accommodate for this filter loss, increasing the cost of the frontend, negatively impacting the front end thermal management, and ultimately, reducing battery life. Furthermore, such frontend losses contribute to human-tissue heating when the mobile device is held against the head or attached to the body (in the case of wearable RF devices).
Akoustis® addresses this critical mobile-wireless need by using single crystal piezoelectric materials to create a new class of acoustic wave filters – improving performance, lowering cost and driving miniaturization. Akoustis’ Bulk ONE® filters originate from materials which exhibit 30% better acoustic performance when compared to the incumbent thin-film technologies deployed today.”
