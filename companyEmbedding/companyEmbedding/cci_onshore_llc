TenPort Multi-Band Antenna


 







The CCI TenPort multi-band array is a ten port antenna with full Wireless Communication Service (WCS) band coverage. With eight high band ports covering 1710-2360 MHz and two low band ports covering 698-894 MHz, this eight foot CCI TenPort provides the capability to deploy two sets of 4×4 Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) in the high band. The TenPort allows separate tilt control for each set of four ports in the high band and the pair of ports in the low band enabling maximum flexibility in network deployment. CCI has engineered its antennas using new and innovative design techniques to provide optimal sidelobe performance, sharp elevation beams, and high front to back ratio. Multiple technologies can now be connected to a single antenna, reducing tower load, lease expense, deployment time and installation cost. CCI antennas are designed and produced to ISO 9001:2008 certification standards for reliability and quality in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities.
