Certified Pre-Owned
Certified Pre-Owned vehicles from Chevrolet, Buick, and GMC offer greater value and confidence than ordinary used cars. That's because each of our CPO vehicles undergo a 172-point vehicle inspection and thorough reconditioning process. And it's why every CPO vehicle includes not one, but two General Motors-backed factory limited warranties. Bring home more value and peace of mind at Bergey's Buick GMC.

IMPORTANT RECALL INFORMATION: Before a Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle is listed or sold, GM requires dealers to complete all safety recalls.  However, because even the best processes can break down, we encourage you to check the recall status of any vehicle at recalls.gm.com and SaferCar.gov.

Certified Pre-Owned Benefits

MORE THAN $2,8001 OF BUILT-IN VALUEFrom our CPO Scheduled Maintenance Program with two included maintenance visits,2 a Powertrain Limited Warranty with $0 deductible, and other benefits that come standard with every Certified Pre-Owned Chevrolet, Buick, and GMC vehicle, you enjoy more than $2,800 of Built-in Value — a greater value than ever before. See below for more details.













POWERTRAIN LIMITED WARRANTY

BUMPER-TO-BUMPER LIMITED WARRANTY

CPO SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE PROGRAM

172-POINT VEHICLE INSPECTION AND RECONDITIONING PROCESS

3-MONTH TRIAL OF ONSTAR SERVICES

POWERTRAIN LIMITED WARRANTY

6-YEAR/100,000-MILE3 POWERTRAIN LIMITED WARRANTYMore coverage means more confidence. With our 6-year/100,000-Mile Powertrain Limited Warranty with Roadside Assistance and Courtesy Transportation4, that's exactly what you get. It's proof that we believe in our vehicles and aren't afraid to stand behind them.Fully transferable with $0 deductible24-hour Roadside AssistanceCourtesy Transportation















BUMPER-TO-BUMPER LIMITED WARRANTY

12-MONTH/12,000-MILE5 BUMPER-TO-BUMPER LIMITED WARRANTYComplementing our longer Powertrain Limited Warranty, every Certified Pre-Owned vehicle also comes with our 12-Month/12,000-Mile Bumper-to-Bumper Limited Warranty with $0 deductible.















CPO SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE PROGRAM

Starting from the delivery of your vehicle, we provide you with our CPO Scheduled Maintenance Program2-a money-saving benefit you won't find anywhere else - that includes two maintenance visits for oil and oil filter changes, tire rotations, and multi-point vehicle inspections.















172-POINT VEHICLE INSPECTION AND RECONDITIONING PROCESS

This is not your regular, everyday used vehicle. Certified status is a name that is earned, and earned only by meeting our rigorous standards. If it doesn't pass, we completely recondition it or we don't certify it. Our 172-point vehicle inspection and reconditioning process is one of the most comprehensive in the industry-and just one of the differences between a regular used vehicle and a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle from Chevrolet, Buick, and GMC.IMPORTANT RECALL INFORMATION: Before a Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle is listed or sold, GM requires dealers to complete all safety recalls. However, because even the best processes can break down, we encourage you to check the recall status of any vehicle at recalls.gm.com and SaferCar.gov.















3-MONTH TRIAL OF ONSTAR SERVICES

New subscribers of OnStar-equipped inactive vehicles are eligible for a three-month trial of the OnStar Guidance Plan6 (excluding Hands-Free Calling minutes) plus three years of OnStar Basic Plan7 (if eligible by model year). Visit onstar.com for vehicle availability, coverage map, details and system limitations.















SIRIUSXM RADIO TRIAL OFFER

All of our satellite radio-equipped Chevrolet, Buick, and GMC Certified Pre-Owned Vehicles come with 3 trial months8 of the SiriusXM All Access package. Hear every channel available in your ride, including all of our premium programming. Plus, listening on the app and online is included, so you'll hear the best SiriusXM has to offer, anywhere life takes you. To learn more about SiriusXM in Certified Pre-Owned vehicles, visit siriusxm.com.















VEHICLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM

Change your mind? If you're not satisfied with your purchase, simply bring it back within the first 3 days or 150 miles9 (whichever comes first) to exchange it for another GM vehicle that fits your needs.















VEHICLE HISTORY REPORT

It's like a background check for your car. All Certified Pre-Owned vehicles include a free CARFAX® Vehicle History Report so you're aware of the vehicle's maintenance history as well as any past problems such as major accidents, fires, or title issues.

I have only brought my car here twice, I usually go to another dealer butlive closer to here so I thought I would give them a try. First two times it really was just a m…atter of attitude, kind of like they really didn't need me as a customer. No big deal, I thought it was just me, as long as the car was taken care of. Third time was a charm. Called to make an appointment for a oil change, they asked me which location did I want to bring the car, Chrsyler or Buick. I said it didn't matter to me, he said "ok". I dropped my car off at the Buick service center since it is a Chevy around6:30am. Left all my information. I didn't hear a word all day, I called up to them around 4:45pm only to find out they never did anything with my car. Curious why nobody called me when I to ask where the car was since I had an appointment. Will never go back, they just don't care about their customers. more » Worst customer service.

Vehicle needed new brakes (had to bring back). It was covered under warranty, but should have been discovered as part of the "certif…ication process." Also found an almost clogged air filter...must not have been checked/replaced at all. To top it off I recently discovered that a factory installed accessory was improperly removed. I really had a good buying experience with my salesman, but really have to question the service department and the certification process.

There is a lot happening at Bergey's auto, truck and tire companies.   Below is the latest news and events.














BERGEY'S TRUCK CENTERS AWARDED HINO TRUCK FRANCHISE IN SOUDERTON, PASeptember 21, 2012Souderton, PA - A brand new Hino medium-duty truck franchise officially opened for business at Bergey's Truck Centers this month. The Souderton franchise is Bergey's second location to join the country's growing network of more than 180 Hino dealers. "Since it entered the U.S. market in 1984, Hino's evolution really caught our attention," says Steve Rybacki, Bergey's medium duty truck manager. "Aside from being a member of the Toyota Group and America's fastest growing medium duty truck manufacturer, Hino has proven itself with several customer satisfaction awards from J.D. Power and Associates. The company also stands behind its products with one of the industry's best warranties. So we jumped at the chance to offer our customers a cut above in medium duty equipment." After establishing a strong customer base as a Hino dealer in Trenton, NJ, the decision was made to expand to Souderton (a suburb of Philadelphia). Bergey's newest franchise carries a full line of Hino medium-duty trucks backed by a knowledgeable and dedicated Hino sales staff. Customers have 24-hour access to an extensive Hino parts inventory with certified Hino technicians on site. Conveniently located off I-476 at the Lansdale exit, the new Hino franchise is also in a great position to help transient customers as they drive through the area. "We're fully equipped to maintain our customers' trucks as well as perform warranty work ? any time day or night," Rybacki says. "Around-the-clock service gives our customers an extra advantage out on the road. And now with locations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, we can provide our customers with an even stronger support system whenever they need it - just another way Bergey's is 'Keeping Customers on the Road.'" Bergey's Truck Centers owns and operates full service commercial truck dealerships in Souderton and Conshohocken, PA; and Pennsauken, Vineland and Trenton, NJ. Established in 1924, the family-owned company represents Mack Trucks, Volvo Trucks, GMC, Ford, Ram, Isuzu, UD and Hino. In addition to its multi-branded locations, Bergey's Truck Centers also offers aftermarket parts and service, finance and insurance, complete commercial tire service, full service truck leasing and rental, collision center, fuel center and towing services.

BERGEY'S TIRE HOSTS GRAND OPENING AT REMODELED RETREAD PLANTMay 15, 
2007 
Bergey's Tire Service entertained, educated and fed over 150 fleet 
customers at 
a Grand Opening at their newly remodeled Perkasie, PA Retread 
Technologies 
plant, Friday, May 11th.  Bergey's spent the last six months 
remodeling the 
Perkasie plant to improve quality, efficiency and to upgrade their 
equipment to 
the latest Marangoni retreading technology. New state of the art 
equipment, from 
inspection to curing, include the addition of the Marangoni ITT Sfera 
Shearographic inspection machine, a Marangoni 2500 buffer, the latest in
building technology in the Marangoni Ringbuilder 3000, the modular AZ 
cushion 
extruder and builder combination, and the latest Cure-Tech curing 
chambers.  Improved lighting, reflective floors, the 
re-designed monorail 
system contributed to showcase the production area.  
Plant tours were enhanced 
by the use of a headset system that aided participants in learning the 
finer 
points of the retreading process while the plant remained in 
operation.  Each 
tour finished in an area set up with a display of the Ringtread designs,
a video 
of the Marangoni Alpha-Ring manufacturing plant to show how the 
Ringtread itself 
is manufactured and to drive home the benefits of the Ringtread to the 
fleet 
owners and managers. A new demonstration showing the benefits of the 
Ringtread's 
double radius fitment finished off the tour.  Start to finish 
education for all 
who attended.  It was a well organized event with the whole 
"Bergey Team" on 
site to be sure their guests left with a better understanding of 
Bergey's 
commitment to serving their customers with state of the art technology 
and the 
best products in the market.Duane Bergey, President,
Bergey Tire comments; 
"With 50 years retreading experience and expertise, we recognize the 
Ringtread 
technology as the most advanced retreading technology in the 
world.  We have 
been producing the Ringtread for six years at our plant in Perkasie, PA 
and it 
continuously distinguishes us from our competitors. We are totally 
committed to 
serving our fleet customers with the best products and services possible
and I 
think this new plant shows how far we will go to reduce their costs and 
help 
them be successful." Bergey's is a family-owned 
company that employs 
over 650 people at their auto and truck dealerships, tire and automotive
service 
centers, tire retreading plant, commercial tire centers and other auto 
related 
businesses in PA, NJ and VA.  Bergey's currently offers sales,

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
