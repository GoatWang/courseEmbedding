														We value agility.														
																													Prediction is very difficult, especially  about the future. 
Niels Bohr


														We respect authenticity.														
																													The greatest way to live with honor in this world  is to be what we pretend to be.
Socrates


														We don’t  buy hype.														
																													Opportunity is missed by most people because it is  dressed in overalls and looks like work.
Thomas Edison


														We're in it for the long run.														
																													Difficulties are just things to overcome, after all.
Ernest Shackleton











We are a small, all-partner VC firm leading Series A deals in SaaS and marketplace companies. We love having the agility to make quick decisions. You should too. We love nimble, scrappy, early-stage founders — you are the ones that have the hunger and creativity to build a business out of nothing.
Authenticity is the only path to meaningful and sustainable success.  There are too many pretenders in the world.  We don’t claim to be anyone we’re not.  You shouldn’t either.  Let’s have an honest conversation about your business: the vision, the growth, and the challenges.
Talk is cheap. Failure is expensive.  We’ve seen the relentless drag of the hype cycle destroy former high-flyers.  We prefer solid business fundamentals over flashy presentations and buzz.  Vanity metrics are cute, but we’d prefer to talk about customers and engagement.
We invest in companies with a big, audacious vision that aim to create a legacy.  We know the path to get there is fraught with difficulty, and we will be committed every step of the way.  We’re honored to have shared the entrepreneurial journey with extremely talented and passionate founders.

Jackson Square Funds


















WELCOME TO JACKSON SQUARE PARTNERS

            Jackson Square Partners, LLC (“Jackson Square” or “the firm”) was incepted May 1, 2014 when the San Francisco-based growth Investment Team (“the team”) spun out of Delaware Investments. Prior to the team’s nine-year tenure at Delaware Investments, the majority of the team was employed at Transamerica.
Jackson Square is a majority employee-owned firm. Delaware Investments retains an equity position in Jackson Square.  The key employee group at Jackson Square has full operational and governance control.  
Jackson Square is a long-only, growth-oriented investment manager of public equities with five investment strategies: Large-Cap Growth, Global Growth, SMID-Cap Growth, Select 20 Growth and All-Cap Growth.
As of June 30, 2017, Jackson Square had approximately $21.4 billion and includes approximately $1.5 billion of non-discretionary assets under management.
JACKSON SQUARE PARTNERS’ NAME 
San Francisco's historic Jackson Square neighborhood has a storied past as the City's oldest commercial center. It was the gateway for sailors, prospectors and entrepreneurs seeking their fortune here during the Gold Rush in the mid-1800s. The neighborhood has retained its historic charm, having auspiciously survived the great earthquake and fire of 1906 that destroyed much of San Francisco. Jackson Square is emblematic of the dual attributes of opportunity and resilience that we seek in holdings for our investment portfolios.

FUND PERFORMANCE
*SMID-Cap Growth Institutional Class -Share Conversion Q&A




* Free cash flow is earnings before depreciation, amortization, and non-cash charges minus maintenance capital expenditures.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.
With the exception of the All-Cap Growth Fund, the Funds are non-diversified meaning they may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore it is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. Small- and Mid-capitalization companies tend to have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater in emerging and frontier markets. Frontier market countries generally have smaller economies and even less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets, and, as a result, the risks of investing in emerging market countries are magnified in frontier market countries. Investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) involve additional risks such as declines in the value of real estate and increased susceptibility to adverse economic or regulatory developments.  When the Fund buys or sells securities on a foreign stock exchange, the transaction is undertaken in the local currency rather than in U.S. dollars. The value of the foreign currency may increase or decrease against the value of the U.S. dollar, which may impact the value of the Fund's portfolio holdings and your investment. Other countries may adopt economic policies and/or currency exchange controls that affect their currency valuations in a manner that is disadvantageous to U.S. investors and companies.  From time to time, the trading market for a particular security or type of security in which the Funds invest may become less liquid or even illiquid.
The Jackson Square Funds are offered only to United States residents, and information on this web site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any Jackson
            Square Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) is determined by dividing the price of the stock by the company’s forecasted earnings per share.
EPS Growth Rate represents the annualized rate of net-income-per-share growth over the trailing one-year period for the stocks held by a fund.
Market Capitalization is the value of the fund as determined by the market price of its issued and outstanding stock.
The specific securities identified and described do not represent all of the securities purchased, sold, or recommended for the fund and no assumptions should be made that the securities identified and discussed were or will be profitable. A full
            list of holdings is available upon request. Fund holdings and sector allocations are subject to change and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security. Complete Fund holdings are generally available 10 business days following quarter end.
For the returns shown for Share Classes for the periods prior to their inception are derived from the historical performance of IS Shares of those Funds during such periods and have been adjusted to reflect the higher total annual operating expenses
            of each specific Share class. 
The MSCI All Country World Index is a free float adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed and emerging markets. The Russell 1000® Growth Index measures the performance
            of the large cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell 1000 Index companies with higher growth earning potential as defined by Russell’s leading style methodology. The Russell 3000® Growth Index measures the
            growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell 3000® Index companies with higher growth earning potential, as defined by Russell’s leading style methodology. The Russell 2500® Growth Index measures the performance of
            the SMID-Cap Growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell 2500® Growth companies with higher price-to-book ratios and higher forecasted growth values. The index is unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in it.

								San Francisco's historic Jackson Square neighborhood has a storied past as the City's oldest commercial center.  It was the gateway for sailors, prospectors and entrepreneurs seeking their fortune here during the Gold Rush in the mid-1800s.  The neighborhood has retained its historic charm, having auspiciously survived the great earthquake and fire of 1906 that destroyed much of San Francisco.  Jackson Square is emblematic of the dual attributes of opportunity and resilience that we seek in holdings for our investment portfolios.
