Committed to Strong Corporate Governance
Ethical business practices are the cornerstone of everything we do at Care Capital Properties. We believe that corporate governance means much more than accurate financial reporting and director independence. Integrity, accountability, transparency, effective oversight, and sound risk management serve as our guiding principles and will lead to superior long-term performance.
We recognize that a strong, independent board of directors plays a pivotal role in shaping the direction of our company and its culture. Our independent directors, who possess extensive experience in the healthcare, real estate, and financial services industries, make up more than 85% of our board. Under the leadership of our Non-Executive Chairman, Douglas Crocker II, these independent directors not only provide valuable guidance and oversight with respect to our financial and operating performance, corporate strategy, and risk management; they also ensure that we are held to exemplary legal and ethical standards.
Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
We expect our directors, officers, employees, and agents acting on our behalf to conduct themselves with integrity and in a way that protects our reputation for fairness and honesty. Accordingly, all such individuals must comply with our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which forms the core of our ethics and compliance program at Care Capital Properties.
We provide multiple ways for employees and other interested parties to report in good faith any concerns or complaints about perceived or potential misconduct, including concerns regarding our internal controls or our accounting or audit practices, by contacting our Compliance Investigator.
Guidelines on Governance and Committee Charters
Our Guidelines on Governance describe the key governance practices we follow to ensure sound risk management and effective oversight by our full board of directors. You can also read about our governance practices in the charters for our Audit and Compliance Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Governance Committee. Each of these committees exercises independent oversight related to the risks associated with the particular responsibilities of that committee.
We invite shareholders and other interested parties to communicate directly with our board by e-mailing bod@carecapitalproperties.com. You can also contact our Non-Executive Chairman or the independent members of our board as a group by e-mailing independentbod@carecapitalproperties.com.

    Our Strategy  


    Guided by our vision, mission, and values, we intend to grow with quality regional and local operators through focused investment in the post-acute healthcare real estate sector.  











    Driving Growth Opportunities  

Care Capital Properties is focused on investing with quality local and regional operators of skilled nursing facilities across the United States. We provide growth capital for this large, highly fragmented, consolidating industry by acquiring quality real estate and entering into long-term, triple-net leases with experienced operators. We generate cash flow growth externally through accretive investments and internally through our annual contractual rent increases and redevelopment of our existing assets. We maintain a portfolio diversified by operator and geography and support our growth with an investment grade rated balance sheet with strong cash flow and liquidity. 
Our strategy is guided by our vision, mission, and values: 
Our Vision
Be consistently recognized by employees, operators, and shareholders as an exceptional partner and investor in the healthcare real estate market.
Our Mission
Be exceptional investors—skilled in realizing opportunities that advance a high quality of care and deliver consistently superior returns.
Our Values
To always act with integrity, and promote transparency, fairness, and respectful treatment of others.
We are: Skilled. Focused. Invested.SM

“I have worked closely with the team from Care Capital Properties for the last three years. Throughout that time they have proven to be very supportive of the strategic direction of our company and have assisted us as we have grown by participating in financing of our buildings, remodeling of existing assets, and providing support and creativity as we considered transactions outside our current footprint. I have personally found the entire team to be a trusted, cooperative, problem-solving group that works through issues professionally with a focus on a positive outcome for all. They do the things they commit to, and that makes all the difference for us.”
John W. Morgan, CEO
Avamere Health Services

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Read Disclaimer 



Barron's is an American weekly newspaper published by Dow Jones & Company, a property of News Corp. that covers US financial information, market developments, and relevant statistics. Each issue provides a summary of the previous week's market activity as well as news reports and an informative outlook on the week to come.  The Top 100 Independent Advisors as identified by Barron’s is published annually. Scoring for the publication reflects the assessment of data provided by the nation’s most productive advisors. Investment performance is not an explicit component because not all advisors have audited results and because performance figures often are influenced more by clients’ risk tolerance than by an advisor’s investment-picking ability.  Barron’s states that ranking reflects the volume of assets overseen by the advisors and their teams, revenues generated for the firms and the quality of the advisors' practices. Furthermore that the scoring systems assigns a top score of 100 and rates the rest by comparing them with the top-ranked advisor. Anchor Capital did not provide data to Barron’s to be included in this assessment and receipt of this designation is no way indicative of any individual client or investor’s experience with the Company or of any client, investor or fund’s future performance.

CCP: NASDAQ
Care Capital Properties (CCP) is the second largest publically traded dedicated skilled nursing facility (SNF) real estate investment trust (REIT). It was spun out of Ventas, another health care REIT, in August of 2015 and now owns 345 properties, which it leases to third-party operators. The portfolio is spread across 36 states and contains a total of about 38,000 beds/units. [1]
Investment thesis
We believe that REITs offer a unique investment opportunity, in which equity investors can benefit from real estate ownership, and are becoming more widely owned as REITs are now a dedicated sector in the S&P 500. [2] As the number of U.S. citizens over 85 increases, we see a growing need for nursing homes, which we expect nursing facility REITs to benefit from. With Care Capital’s stock down 30% from its $34 high at the time of spin, we thought that the selloff may be overdone. [3]
Confirmation through research
The U.S. contains 15,632 skilled nursing homes, down from 15,726 at the end of 2008 and will continue to decline. [4] The number of U.S. citizens over 85 has risen to 6.5M, up from 4M in 2000 and is projected to increase to 10M by 2030. [5] SNFs provide traditional long term nursing home care and are supported by Medicaid and Medicare. [6] Medicaid and Medicare daily rates have increased at a 2-3% annual rate since 2008 but those rates are being pressured by efforts to shorten the length of stay and bundle services. [7]
We believe that the stock is down due to the risk of increasing interest rates, operator financial difficulties, leverage and reimbursement risk. Even with increasing interest rates, we trust that REITs will continue to play an important role in portfolios. Some nursing home REITs have run into difficulty with operators burdened by increased regulatory costs, and any Medicaid or regulatory relief for skilled nursing operators would be a welcome benefit. With the current administration in place, we believe this is more likely. Based on our research, we feel that Care Capital’s operators are in decent financial positions and this quarter management reported increases in rent coverages by two of its largest operators. [8] CCP also finished restructuring its debt this quarter, which we see as a breakthrough. [9]
Variant Perception
CCP is selling at a discount to other health care REITs on an EV/EBITDA and dividend yield basis. [10] We believe that the dividend will be covered by cash flows, which are also supported by recent asset sales, and that the demand for skilled nursing will continue to grow while supply is constrained by the lack of capital and investor concerns about Medicare reimbursement. Given the depressed valuation, we consider the risk/reward to be in our favor.
