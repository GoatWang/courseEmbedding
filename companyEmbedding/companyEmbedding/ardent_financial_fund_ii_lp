Our Clients are highly successful, well-managed and referred by other clients



In addition to providing me with completely unique solutions, the Ardent Team provides me with sustainable cost savings on group insurance, group retirement and individual insurance products. As a business owner, I really appreciate when someone can provide me with services that are exceptional, while doing it in a highly cost-effective manner.

FounderBroadcast Communications Corporation



I chose to work with Bryan Grom and the Ardent team for a number of reasons. First, they have proven to me that they provide unbiased, independent consulting that is truly in the best interests of their clients. Second, the Ardent Team is accountable for the advice and counsel that they provide. I know who I am dealing with, and who to go to when I have a question or problem, and I can get quick answers.

Vice-President, Human ResourcesCustom Manufacturer



Our business is a growing, dynamic, entrepreneurial company. As a result, I expect to work with professionals that are the best at what they do, highly experienced, provide innovative solutions to business problems, and stand behind the advice they give. I chose to work with Bryan Grom and the Ardent Group team because that is exactly what they do.

Vice-PresidentInternational Agriculture Product Manufacturer



We were looking for some unique investment options for our group pension that reflected our organizational values but there was nothing available. We were absolutely thrilled when Bryan Grom and the Ardent team were able to use their contacts and knowledge to come up with the first and only Socially Responsible Asset Allocation Fund in Canada.

ExecutiveInternational Faith Based Organization



At our company, we work with many large national and international consulting firms throughout North America. We regard Bryan Grom and the Ardent Team as the benchmark of what we expect from our advisors. They have always been there to work through issues with us. We know who to go to when we need a solution to a problem and they have never let us down.

Executive Vice-PresidentForestry Company



As a business owner, I expect a high level of service, expertise and personal attention from the consultants that I work with. I don’t feel that we should have to settle for off-the-shelf products and pricing. The Ardent Team has really taken the time to get to know us and our specific needs and this has translated into some very creative and unique solutions and significant cost savings for our group benefit plan. I would highly recommend their services.
