              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental authorities, exempt
from all Federal income taxes and from Ohio State and local income taxes under
existing law.  At October 16, 1998, each Unit represented a 1/1,922 undivided
interest in the principal and net income of the Trust (see "The Fund" in Part
Two).


The Units being offered by this Prospectus are issued and outstanding Units
which have been purchased by the Sponsor in the secondary market or from the
Trustee after having been tendered for redemption.  The profit or loss
resulting from the sale of Units will accrue to the Sponsor.  No proceeds from
the sale of Units will be received by the Trust.



Public Offering Price



The Public Offering Price of the Units is equal to the aggregate value of the
Bonds in the Portfolio of the Trust divided by the number of Units
outstanding, plus a sales charge of 3.8% of the Public Offering Price (3.950%
of the amount invested).  At October 16, 1998, the Public Offering Price per
Unit was $447.03 plus net interest accrued to date of settlement (three
business days after such date) of $3.03 and $9.14 for the monthly and semi-
annual distribution plans, respectively (see "Market for Units" in Part Two).



Please retain all parts of this Prospectus for future reference.


THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR
ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL
OFFENSE.

Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return



Estimated Current Return to Unit holders under the semi-annual distribution
plan was 4.11% per annum on October 16, 1998, and 4.01% under the monthly
distribution plan.  Estimated Long-Term Return to Unit holders under the semi-
annual distribution plan was .42% per annum on October 16, 1998, and .32%
under the monthly distribution plan.  Estimated Current Return is calculated
by dividing the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public
Offering Price.  Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula
which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative
weightings of the market values, yields (which take into account the
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated
retirements of all of the Bonds in the Trust and (2) takes into account a
compounding factor and the expenses and sales charge associated with each Unit
of the Trust.  Since the market values and estimated retirements of the Bonds
and the expenses of the Trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return indicated
above will be realized in the future.  Estimated Current Return and Estimated
Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the calculation of the
Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal
returned while the Estimated Current Return calculations include only Net
Annual Interest Income and Public Offering Price.  The above figures are based
on estimated per Unit cash flows.  Estimated cash flows will vary with changes
in fees and expenses, with changes in current interest rates, and with the
principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, call, exchange or sale of the
underlying Bonds.  See "What are Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-
Term Return?" in Part Two.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO



July 31, 1998


(a)   Shown under this heading are the year in which each issue of Bonds is
initially redeemable and the redemption price in that year or, if
currently redeemable, the redemption price at July 31, 1998.  Unless
otherwise indicated, each issue continues to be redeemable at declining
prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for zero coupon bonds
which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount
of original issue discount accreted to the redemption date plus, if
applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years.  "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to
an issue of bonds.  In addition, certain bonds are sometimes redeemable
in whole or in part other than by operation of the stated redemption or
sinking fund provisions under specified unusual or extraordinary
circumstances.  Approximately 89% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Bonds in the Trust is currently redeemable.


(b)   The ratings shown are those effective at July 31, 1998.


(c)   Insurance has been obtained by the Bond issuer.  No premium is payable
by the Trust.


(d)   These Bonds have no stated interest rate ("zero coupon bonds") and,
accordingly, will have no periodic interest payments to the Trust.  Upon
maturity, the holders of these bonds are entitled to receive 100% of the
stated principal amount.  The Bonds were issued at an original issue
discount on August 6, 1985 at a price of 4.849% of their original
principal amount.


(e)   The Trust consists of three obligations of issuers located in Ohio.
None of the Bonds in the Trust are general obligations of a governmental
entity.  All issues are revenue bonds payable from the income of a
specific project or authority and are divided by purpose of issue as
follows:  Single Family Housing, 1; and Miscellaneous, 2.  Approximately
11% of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds consists of single
family residential mortgage revenue bonds.  Each of the Bond issues
represents 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds in
the Trust.  The largest such issue represents approximately 51%.

THE FIRST TRUST OF INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS - MULTI-STATE

OHIO TRUST, SERIES 10






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1.  Significant accounting policies


Security valuation -


Bonds are stated at values as determined by Securities Evaluation Service,
Inc. (the Evaluator), certain shareholders of which are officers of the
Sponsor.  The bond values are based on (1) current bid prices for the bonds
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to
those held by the Trust, (2) current bid prices for comparable bonds, (3)
appraisal or (4) any combination of the above (see Note 3).


Security cost -


The Trust's cost of its portfolio is based on the offering prices of the bonds
on the Date of Deposit, September 30, 1986.  The premium or discount
(including original issue discount) existing at the Date of Deposit is not
being amortized.  Realized gain (loss) from bond transactions is reported on
an identified cost basis.  Sales and redemptions of bonds are recorded on the
trade date.


Federal income taxes -


The Trust is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes.  Each unit holder is
considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust and,
accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes.






Expenses of the Trust -



In addition to insurance coverage acquired by the Trust (see Note 3), the
Trust pays a fee for Trustee services which is based on $1.05 and $.55 per
$1,000 principal amount of Bonds for those portions of the Trust under the
monthly and semi-annual distribution plans, respectively.  Prior to September
1, 1995, the Trustee was United States Trust Company of New York; effective
September 1, 1995, The Chase Manhattan Bank succeeded United States Trust
Company of New York as Trustee.  Additionally, a fee of $900 annually is
payable to the Evaluator and the Trust pays all related expenses of the
Trustee and recurring financial reporting costs.


2.  Unrealized appreciation and depreciation


An analysis of net unrealized appreciation at July 31, 1998 follows:








Unrealized appreciation                             $186,283
Unrealized depreciation                                    -
                                                    ________

                                                    $186,283
                                                    ========











3.  Insurance


The Trust has acquired insurance coverage which provides for the scheduled
payments of principal and interest on all bonds in its portfolio and one issue
is also insured by insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds (see Note (c)
to portfolio).  While insurance coverage acquired by an issuer of bonds
continues in force so long as the bonds are outstanding and the insurer
remains in business, insurance coverage acquired by the Trust is effective
only while the bonds are owned by the Trust and, in the event of disposition
of such a bond by the Trustee, the insurance terminates as to such bond on the
date of disposition.  Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of Financial
Guaranty Insurance Company, in the event of a sale of a bond from the
portfolio, the Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance for such
bond upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the
proceeds of the sale of such bond.  Annual insurance premiums payable by the
Trust in future years, assuming no change in the portfolio, would be $328.


The valuation of bonds does not include any amount attributable to the
insurance acquired by the Trust as there has been no default in the payment of
principal or interest on the bonds in the portfolio as of the date of these
financial statements and, in the opinion of the Sponsor, the bonds are being
quoted in the market at a value which does not reflect a significant risk of
such default.


4.  Other information


Cost to investors -


The cost to initial investors of units of the Trust was based on the aggregate
offering price of the bonds on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a
sales charge of 4.8% of the public offering price which is equivalent to
approximately 5.042% of the net amount invested.


Distributions to unit holders -


Distributions of net interest income to unit holders are made monthly or semi-
annually.  Such income distributions per unit, on an accrual basis, were as
follows:








  Type of                                   Year ended July 31,

This Prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an

This Prospectus does not contain all the information set forth in the
registration statement and exhibits relating thereto, which the Trust has

PROSPECTUS





Part One





Dated November 25, 1998



Note: Part One of this Prospectus may not be distributed unless accompanied by


Part Two and Part Three.


In the opinion of Counsel, interest income to the Trust and to Unit holders,
with certain exceptions, is exempt under existing law from all Federal income
taxes.  In addition, the interest income is, in the opinion of Special
Counsel, exempt to the extent indicated from Pennsylvania State and local
income taxes.  Capital gains, if any, are subject to tax.



The Trust



The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds - Multi-State, Pennsylvania Trust,
Series 9 (the "Trust") is an insured and fixed portfolio of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of municipalities and other governmental
authorities within the State of Pennsylvania, the interest on which is, in the
opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental authorities,
exempt from all Federal income taxes and from Pennsylvania State and local
income taxes under existing law.  At October 16, 1998, each Unit represented a
1/1,497 undivided interest in the principal and net income of the Trust (see
"The Fund" in Part Two).


The Units being offered by this Prospectus are issued and outstanding Units
which have been purchased by the Sponsor in the secondary market or from the
Trustee after having been tendered for redemption.  The profit or loss
resulting from the sale of Units will accrue to the Sponsor.  No proceeds from
the sale of Units will be received by the Trust.



Public Offering Price



The Public Offering Price of the Units is equal to the aggregate value of the
Bonds in the Portfolio of the Trust divided by the number of Units
outstanding, plus a sales charge of 5.1% of the Public Offering Price (5.374%
of the amount invested).  At October 16, 1998, the Public Offering Price per
Unit was $335.73 plus net interest accrued to date of settlement (three
business days after such date) of $2.25 and $7.54 for the monthly and semi-
annual distribution plans, respectively (see "Market for Units" in Part Two).



Please retain all parts of this Prospectus for future reference.


THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR
ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL
OFFENSE.

Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return



Estimated Current Return to Unit holders under the semi-annual distribution
plan was 4.78% per annum on October 16, 1998, and 4.66% under the monthly
distribution plan.  Estimated Long-Term Return to Unit holders under the semi-
annual distribution plan was 3.38% per annum on October 16, 1998, and 3.25%
under the monthly distribution plan.  Estimated Current Return is calculated
by dividing the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public
Offering Price.  Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula
which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative
weightings of the market values, yields (which take into account the
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated
retirements of all of the Bonds in the Trust and (2) takes into account a
compounding factor and the expenses and sales charge associated with each Unit
of the Trust.  Since the market values and estimated retirements of the Bonds
and the expenses of the Trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return indicated
above will be realized in the future.  Estimated Current Return and Estimated
Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the calculation of the
Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal
returned while the Estimated Current Return calculations include only Net
Annual Interest Income and Public Offering Price.  The above figures are based
on estimated per Unit cash flows.  Estimated cash flows will vary with changes
in fees and expenses, with changes in current interest rates, and with the
principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, call, exchange or sale of the
underlying Bonds.  See "What are Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-
Term Return?" in Part Two.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO



July 31, 1998


(a)   Shown under this heading are the year in which each issue of Bonds is
initially redeemable and the redemption price in that year or, if
currently redeemable, the redemption price at July 31, 1998.  Unless
otherwise indicated, each issue continues to be redeemable at declining
prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for zero coupon bonds
which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount
of original issue discount accreted to the redemption date plus, if
applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years.  "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to
an issue of bonds.  In addition, certain bonds are sometimes redeemable
in whole or in part other than by operation of the stated redemption or
sinking fund provisions under specified unusual or extraordinary
circumstances.  Approximately 99% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Bonds in the Trust is subject to call within one year.


(b)   The ratings shown are those effective at July 31, 1998.


(c)   Insurance has also been obtained by the Bond issuer.


(d)   These Bonds have no stated interest rate ("zero coupon bonds") and,
accordingly, will have no periodic interest payments to the Trust.  Upon
maturity, the holders of these Bonds are entitled to receive 100% of the
stated principal amount.  The Bonds were issued at an original issue
discount on September 15, 1983 at a price of 3.234% of their original
principal amount.


(e)   The Trust consists of four obligations of issuers located in
Pennsylvania.  None of the Bonds in the Trust are general obligations of
a governmental entity.  All issues are revenue bonds payable from the
income of a specific project or authority and are divided by purpose of
issue as follows:  Utilities, 1; Single Family Housing, 1; and
Miscellaneous, 2.  Approximately 68% and 1% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Bonds consist of utility revenue bonds and single family
residential mortgage revenue bonds, respectively.  Each of three Bond
issues represents 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds in the Trust or a total of approximately 99%.  The largest such
issue represents approximately 68%.

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES 7

THE FIRST TRUST OF INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS - MULTI-STATE

PENNSYLVANIA TRUST, SERIES 9




NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1.  Significant accounting policies


Security valuation -


Bonds are stated at values as determined by Securities Evaluation Service,
Inc. (the Evaluator), certain shareholders of which are officers of the
Sponsor.  The bond values are based on (1) current bid prices for the bonds
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to
those held by the Trust, (2) current bid prices for comparable bonds, (3)
appraisal or (4) any combination of the above (see Note 3).


Security cost -


The Trust's cost of its portfolio is based on the offering prices of the bonds
on the Date of Deposit, September 30, 1986.  The premium or discount
(including original issue discount) existing at the Date of Deposit is not
being amortized.  Realized gain (loss) from bond transactions is reported on
an identified cost basis.  Sales and redemptions of bonds are recorded on the
trade date.


Federal income taxes -


The Trust is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes.  Each unit holder is
considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust and,
accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes.






Expenses of the Trust -



In addition to insurance coverage acquired by the Trust (see Note 3), the
Trust pays a fee for Trustee services which is based on $1.05 and $.55 per
$1,000 principal amount of Bonds for those portions of the Trust under
the monthly and semi-annual distribution plans, respectively.  Prior to
September 1, 1995, the Trustee was United States Trust Company of New York;
effective September 1, 1995, The Chase Manhattan Bank succeeded United States
Trust Company of New York as Trustee.  Additionally, a fee of $900 annually is
payable to the Evaluator and the Trust pays all related expenses of the
Trustee and recurring financial reporting costs.


2.  Unrealized appreciation and depreciation


An analysis of net unrealized appreciation at July 31, 1998 follows:








Unrealized appreciation                              $90,889
Unrealized depreciation                                    -
                                                     _______

                                                     $90,889
                                                     =======











3.  Insurance


The Trust has acquired insurance coverage which provides for the scheduled
payments of principal and interest on all bonds in its portfolio and one issue
is also insured by insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds (see Note (c)
to portfolio).  While insurance coverage acquired by an issuer of bonds
continues in force so long as the bonds are outstanding and the insurer
remains in business, insurance coverage acquired by the Trust is effective
only while the bonds are owned by the Trust and, in the event of disposition
of such a bond by the Trustee, the insurance terminates as to such bond on the
date of disposition.  Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of Financial
Guaranty Insurance Company, in the event of a sale of a bond from the
portfolio, the Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance for such
bond upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the
proceeds of the sale of such bond.  Annual insurance premiums payable by the
Trust in future years, assuming no change in the portfolio, would be $225.


The valuation of bonds does not include any amount attributable to the
insurance acquired by the Trust as there has been no default in the payment of
principal or interest on the bonds in the portfolio as of the date of these
financial statements and, in the opinion of the Sponsor, the bonds are being
quoted in the market at a value which does not reflect a significant risk of
such default.


4.  Other information


Cost to investors -


The cost to initial investors of units of the Trust was based on the aggregate
offering price of the bonds on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a
sales charge of 4.8% of the public offering price which is equivalent to
approximately 5.042% of the net amount invested.


Distributions to unit holders -


Distributions of net interest income to unit holders are made monthly or semi-
annually.  Such income distributions per unit, on an accrual basis, were as
follows:








  Type of                                    Year ended July 31,

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. IN ADDITION, THE INTEREST INCOME TO THE TRUSTS IS,
IN THE OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL, EXEMPT TO THE EXTENT INDICATED FROM
STATE AND LOCAL TAXES WHEN HELD BY RESIDENTS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE
ISSUERS OF THE BONDS IN SUCH TRUSTS ARE LOCATED. CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY,
ARE SUBJECT TO TAX.


THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES (the "Fund") consists of underlying
separate unit investment trusts (the "Trusts"). The various trusts are
collectively referred to herein as the "Trusts" while all Trusts that
are not designated as "The First Trust Advantage" are sometimes
collectively referred to herein as the "Insured Trusts" and a Trust with
the name designation of "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds,
Discount Trust" or "The First Trust Advantage: Discount Trust" is
sometimes referred to herein as a "Discount Trust." Each Trust consists
of a portfolio of interest-bearing obligations, issued by or on behalf
of states and territories of the United States, and political
subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the
opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental
authorities, exempt from all Federal income taxes under existing law
although interest on certain Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas,
Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for
purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax. In addition, the interest
income of each Trust is, in the opinion of Special Counsel, exempt to
the extent indicated from state and local income taxes when held by
residents of the state in which the issuers of the Bonds in such Trust
are located. The securities in a Discount Trust are acquired at prices
which result in a Discount Trust portfolio, as a whole, being purchased
at a deep discount from the aggregate par value of such Securities
although a substantial portion of the Securities in a Discount Trust
portfolio may be acquired at a premium over the par value of such
Securities. All of the Bonds in an Intermediate Trust mature within 8 to
12 years of the Initial Date of Deposit. All of the Bonds in a Short
Intermediate Trust mature within 3 to 6 years of the Initial Date of
Deposit. All of the Bonds in a Long Intermediate Trust mature within 10
to 15 years of the Initial Date of Deposit. The portfolio for each
Trust, essential information based thereon and financial statements,
including a report of independent auditors relating to the series of the
Fund offered hereby, are contained in Part One to which reference should
be made for such information.


INSURANCE GUARANTEEING THE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
ON ALL BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO OF EACH INSURED TRUST HAS BEEN OBTAINED
FROM FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY AND/OR AMBAC INDEMNITY
CORPORATION BY THE INSURED TRUSTS OR WAS DIRECTLY OBTAINED BY THE BOND
ISSUER, THE UNDERWRITERS, THE SPONSOR OR OTHERS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL
DATE OF DEPOSIT FROM FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY, AMBAC
INDEMNITY CORPORATION, OR OTHER INSURERS (THE "PREINSURED BONDS").
INSURANCE OBTAINED BY AN INSURED TRUST APPLIES ONLY WHILE BONDS ARE
RETAINED IN SUCH TRUST, WHILE INSURANCE ON PREINSURED BONDS IS EFFECTIVE
SO LONG AS SUCH BONDS ARE OUTSTANDING. PURSUANT TO AN IRREVOCABLE
COMMITMENT OF FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY, AND/OR AMBAC
INDEMNITY CORPORATION IN THE EVENT OF A SALE OF A BOND INSURED UNDER AN
INSURANCE POLICY OBTAINED BY AN INSURED TRUST, THE TRUSTEE HAS THE RIGHT
TO OBTAIN PERMANENT INSURANCE FOR SUCH BOND UPON THE PAYMENT OF A SINGLE
PREDETERMINED INSURANCE PREMIUM FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF SUCH
BOND. THE INSURANCE, IN EITHER CASE, RELATES ONLY TO THE BONDS IN THE
INSURED TRUSTS AND NOT TO THE UNITS OFFERED HEREBY. AS A RESULT OF SUCH
INSURANCE, THE UNITS OF EACH INSURED TRUST HAVE RECEIVED A RATING OF
"AAA" BY STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS GROUP, A DIVISION OF MCGRAW-HILL,
INC. ("STANDARD & POOR'S"). SEE "WHY AND HOW ARE THE INSURED TRUSTS
INSURED?" ON PAGE 10. NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO ANY INSURER'S
ABILITY TO MEET ITS COMMITMENTS.



ALL PARTS OF THE PROSPECTUS SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.



THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY
OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.


Page 1


For convenience the Prospectus is divided into sections which give
general information about the Fund and specific information such as the
public offering price, distributions and tax status for each Trust.


The Objectives of the Fund are conservation of capital through
investment in portfolios of tax-exempt bonds and income exempt from
Federal and applicable state and local income taxes although interest on
certain Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and
Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for purposes of the Federal
Alternative Minimum Tax. ACCORDINGLY, CERTAIN ARKANSAS, IDAHO, KANSAS,

MAINE, MISSISSIPPI AND NEBRASKA TRUSTS MAY BE APPROPRIATE ONLY FOR
INVESTORS WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX. CERTAIN
BONDS IN THE OKLAHOMA TRUSTS ARE SUBJECT TO OKLAHOMA STATE INCOME TAXES.
The payment of interest and the preservation of principal are, of
course, dependent upon the continuing ability of the issuers, obligors
and/or insurers to meet their respective obligations.


Distributions to Unit holders may be reinvested as described herein. See
"Rights of Unit Holders-How Can Distributions to Unit Holders be
Reinvested?"


The Sponsor, although not obligated to do so, intends to maintain a
market for the Units at prices based upon the aggregate bid price of the
Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust. In the absence of such a market, a
Unit holder will nonetheless be able to dispose of the Units through
redemption at prices based upon the bid prices of the underlying Bonds.
See "Rights of Unit Holders-How May Units be Redeemed?" With respect to
each Insured Trust, neither the bid nor offering prices of the
underlying Bonds or of the Units, absent situations in which Bonds are
in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of
such default, include value attributable to the portfolio insurance
obtained by such Trust. See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?"

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES




What is The First Trust Combined Series?



The First Trust Combined Series (the "Fund") is one of a series of
investment companies created by the Sponsor under the name of The First
Trust Combined Series, all of which are generally similar but each of
which is separate and is designated by a different series number. This
Series consists of underlying separate unit investment trusts (such
Trusts being collectively referred to herein as the "Fund"). Each Series
was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust
Agreement (the "Indenture"), dated the Initial Date of Deposit, with
Nike Securities L.P., as Sponsor, The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee,
Securities Evaluation Service, Inc., as Evaluator and First Trust
Advisors L.P., as Portfolio Supervisor. Only Units of a National Trust
may be offered for sale to residents of the State of Illinois. Only
Units of an Indiana Trust and/or a National Trust may be offered for
sale to residents of the State of Indiana. Only Units of a Virginia
Trust and/or a National Trust may be offered for sale to residents of
the State of Virginia. Only Units of a Washington Trust and/or a
National Trust may be offered for sale to residents of Washington. On
the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee
interest-bearing obligations, including delivery statements relating to
contracts for the purchase of certain such obligations and irrevocable
letters of credit issued by a financial institution in the amounts
required for such purchases (the "Bonds"). The Trustee thereafter
credited the account of the Sponsor for Units of each Trust representing
the entire ownership of the Fund which Units are being offered hereby.


The objectives of the Fund are Federal tax-exempt income and state and
local tax-exempt income and conservation of capital through investment
in portfolios of interest-bearing obligations issued by or on behalf of
the state for which such Trust is named (collectively, the "State
Trusts"), and counties, municipalities, authorities and political
subdivisions thereof, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other
territories or municipalities of the United States, or authorities or
political subdivisions thereof, the interest on which obligations is, in
the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental
authorities, exempt from all Federal income tax and, where applicable,
state and local taxes under existing law although interest on certain
Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and
Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for purposes of the
Alternative Minimum Tax and certain Bonds in the Oklahoma Trusts are
subject to Oklahoma State Income Taxes. The current market value of
certain of the obligations in a Discount Trust were significantly below
face value when the obligations were acquired by such Trust. The prices
at which the obligations are acquired result in a Discount Trust's
portfolio, as a whole, being purchased at a deep discount from the
aggregate par value of such Securities although a substantial portion of
the Securities in a Discount Trust portfolio may be acquired at a
premium over the par value of such Securities. Insurance guaranteeing
the scheduled payment of all principal and interest on Bonds in the
Trusts with the name designation of "The First Trust of Insured
Municipal Bonds," "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-
Intermediate" or "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-Multi-
State" (the "Insured Trusts") has been obtained by such Trusts from
Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("Financial Guaranty") and/or AMBAC
Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity") or was obtained directly by
the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others prior to the
Initial Date of Deposit from Financial Guaranty, AMBAC Indemnity, or
other insurers (the "Preinsured Bonds"). NO PORTFOLIO INSURANCE POLICY
HAS BEEN OBTAINED BY THE TRUSTS WITH THE NAME DESIGNATION OF "THE FIRST
TRUST ADVANTAGE" (THE "ADVANTAGE TRUSTS").  The portfolio insurance
obtained by the Insured Trusts is effective only while the Bonds thus
insured are held in such Trusts, while insurance on Preinsured Bonds is
effective so long as such Bonds are outstanding. See "Why and How are
the Insured Trusts Insured?" THERE IS, OF COURSE, NO GUARANTEE THAT THE

FUND'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACHIEVED. AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND SHOULD BE
MADE WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS WHICH AN INVESTMENT IN FIXED
RATE LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS MAY ENTAIL, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT THE
VALUE OF THE UNITS WILL DECLINE WITH INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES.


Neither the Public Offering Price of the Units of an Insured Trust nor
any evaluation of such Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions
reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by such Trust
unless Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in
significant risk of such default. See "Public Offering-How is the Public
Offering Price Determined?" On the other hand, the value of insurance


Page 3


obtained by the Bond issuer, the Sponsor or others is reflected and
included in the market value of such Bonds.


Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust or by the Bond issuer, the
Sponsor or others is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer,
but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security
therefor. If an issue is accepted for insurance, a noncancelable policy
for the scheduled payment of interest and principal on the Bonds is
issued by the insurer. A single premium is paid by the Bond issuer, the
underwriters, the Sponsor or others for Preinsured Bonds and a monthly
premium is paid by each Insured Trust for the insurance obtained by such
Trust except for Bonds in such Trust which are insured by the Bond
issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others in which case no
premiums for insurance are paid by such Trust. Upon the sale of a Bond
insured under the insurance policy obtained by an Insured Trust, the
Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from Financial
Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity with respect to such Bond upon the
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of
the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in an Insured Trust of the
Fund is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. Standard & Poor's and
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. have rated the claims-paying ability of
Financial Guaranty and AMBAC Indemnity "AAA" and "Aaa," respectively.
See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?"


In selecting Bonds, the following facts, among others, were considered:

(i) the Standard & Poor's rating or Fitch Investors Service, Inc.'s
rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "BBB" in the case of an
Insured Trust (or an Arkansas, Kansas or Maine Advantage Trust) and "A-"
in the case of other Advantage Trusts, or the Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "Baa" in the case of
an Insured Trust (or an Arkansas, Kansas or Maine Advantage Trust) and
"A" in the case of other Advantage Trusts, including provisional or
conditional ratings, respectively, or, if not rated, the Bonds had, in
the opinion of the Sponsor, credit characteristics sufficiently similar
to the credit characteristics of interest-bearing tax-exempt obligations
that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the Fund (see
"Description of Bond Ratings"); (ii) the prices of the Bonds relative to
other bonds of comparable quality and maturity; (iii) with respect to
the Insured Trusts, the availability and cost of insurance of the
principal and interest on the Bonds and (iv) the diversification of
Bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer. Subsequent to the
Initial Date of Deposit, a Bond may cease to be rated or its rating may
be reduced below the minimum required as of the Initial Date of Deposit.
Neither event requires elimination of such Bond from the portfolio, but
may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to
direct the Trustee to dispose of the Bond. See "Rights of Unit Holders-
How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?" The Portfolio appearing in Part
One contains Bond ratings, when available, for the Bonds listed at the
date shown.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may have been acquired at a market
discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on the
discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
Trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued
bonds of comparable rating and type. The market discount of previously
issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued
comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall,
other things being equal. A discount bond held to maturity will have a
larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and
capital gain and less in the form of tax-exempt interest income than a
comparable bond newly issued at current market rates. See "What is the
Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?" appearing in Part Three for each
Trust.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be original issue discount bonds.
Under current law, the original issue discount, which is the difference
between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of
the Bonds, is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion
is treated as tax-exempt interest income for Federal income tax
purposes. On sale or redemption, any gain realized that is in excess of
the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital
gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case
the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income. See
"What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?" appearing in Part
Three for each Trust. The current value of an original discount bond
reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity.
The market value tends to increase in greater increments as the Bonds
approach maturity.


Certain of the original issue discount bonds may be Zero Coupon Bonds
(including bonds known as multiplier bonds, money multiplier bonds,


Page 4


capital appreciation bonds, capital accumulator bonds, compound interest
bonds and money discount maturity payment bonds). Zero Coupon Bonds do
not provide for the payment of any current interest and generally
provide for payment at maturity at face value unless sooner sold or
redeemed. Zero Coupon bond features include (1) not paying interest on a
semi-annual basis and (2) providing for the reinvestment of the bond's
semi-annual earnings at the bond's stated yield to maturity. While Zero
Coupon Bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate
of return minimizes reinvestment risk, this benefit can be negated in
large part by weak call protection.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may have been acquired at a market
premium from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on the
premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
Trusts were higher than the current market interest rates for newly
issued bonds of comparable rating and type. The current returns of bonds
trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current
returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently
prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in
market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes
payable. Because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at
maturity but through current income payments, early redemption of a
premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a
reduction in yield. Redemptions are more likely to occur at times when
the Bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium
over par, or for original issue discount Bonds, a premium over the
accreted value. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in the Fund
at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will
represent a loss of capital when compared to the original Public
Offering Price of the Units. Because premium bonds generally pay a
higher rate of interest than bonds priced at or below par, the effect of
the redemption of premium bonds would be to reduce Estimated Net Annual
Unit Income by a greater percentage than the par amount of such bonds
bears to the total par amount of Bonds in the Trust. Although the actual
impact of any such redemptions that may occur will depend upon the
specific Bonds that are redeemed, it can be anticipated that the
Estimated Net Annual Unit Income will be significantly reduced after the
dates on which such Bonds are eligible for redemption. The Trust may be
required to sell Zero Coupon Bonds prior to maturity (at their current
market price which is likely to be less than their par value) in order
to pay expenses of the Trust or in case the Trust is terminated. See
"Rights of Unit Holders-How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?" and
"Other Information-How May the Indenture be Amended or Terminated?"


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be general obligations of a
governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity.
All other Bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income
of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's
power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are secured by the
issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of
principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable
only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of
facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax
or other specific revenue source. There are, of course, variations in
the security of the different Bonds in the Fund, both within a
particular classification and between classifications, depending on
numerous factors.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be healthcare revenue bonds.
Healthcare revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are
primarily derived from services provided by hospitals or other
healthcare facilities, including nursing homes. A healthcare issuer's
ability to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent
on various factors, including occupancy levels of the facility, demand,
government regulations, wages of employees, overhead expenses,
competition from other similar providers, malpractice insurance costs
and the degree of governmental competition from other similar providers,
malpractice insurance costs and the degree of governmental financial
assistance, including Medicare and Medicaid and other similar third-
party payer programs.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be housing revenue bonds. Housing
revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily
derived from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing
projects for low to moderate income families. Housing revenue bonds are
generally payable at any time and therefore their average life will
ordinarily be less than their stated maturities. The ability of such
issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent
on various factors, including occupancy levels, rental income, mortgage
default rates, taxes, operating expenses, governmental regulations and
the appropriation of subsidies.


Page 5


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers whose
revenues are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services.
Water and sewerage bonds are generally payable from user fees. Problems
faced by such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate
rate increases, population decline resulting in decreased user fees, the
difficulty of financing large construction programs, the limitations on
operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental
considerations, the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering
new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation programs and the
impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers whose
revenues are primarily derived from the sale of electric energy.
Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, among other things, establish the rates which may be
charged and the appropriate rate of return. The problems faced by such
issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and
adequate rate increases from the governing public utility commission,
the difficulty in financing large construction programs, increased
federal, state and municipal government regulations, the limitations on
operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental
considerations, increased competition, recent reductions in estimates of
future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country, the
difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt, the
difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of
energy conservation.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be lease obligations issued
primarily by governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other
means of directly raising revenues. Rather, the governmental authorities
are financing vehicles created solely for the construction of buildings

(i.e., schools, administrative offices, convention centers and prisons)

or the purchase of equipment (i.e., police cars and computer systems)
that will be used by a state or local government (the "lessee"). These
obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee
government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service
on the obligations. Lease obligations are subject, in almost all cases,
to annual appropriation risk, i.e., the lessee government is not legally
obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the
current fiscal year, or construction and abatement risk-rental
obligations cease in the event that delays in building, damage,
destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the
lessee.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be industrial revenue bonds
("IRBs"), tax-exempt securities issued by states, municipalities, public
authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring,
constructing or improving various industrial projects. Debt service
payments on IRBs are dependent on various factors, including the
creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and, if
applicable, corporate guarantor, revenues generated from the project
and, if applicable, corporate guarantor, revenues generated from the
project and regulatory and environmental restrictions.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations which are payable
from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of
facilities such as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities,
convention centers and arenas. The ability of issuers to make debt
service payments on airport obligations is dependent on the capability
of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other
factors, many airlines may have difficulty meeting their obligations
under these use agreements. Similarly, payment on Bonds related to other
facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects, such as user fees
from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings.
Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues
due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance, decreased use of a
facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, scarcity of
fuel and reduction or loss of rents.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers which
govern the operation of schools, colleges and universities and whose
revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes. General problems
relating to college and university obligations would include the
prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of
"college" age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees
sufficiently to cover increased operating costs, the uncertainty of
continued receipt of Federal grants and state funding and new government
legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or
costs of such issuers.


Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations which are payable
from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource
recovery facilities. Resource recovery facilities are designed to


Page 6


process solid waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity.
Resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional
redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances,
including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation of a project;
contracts relating to a project becoming void, unenforceable or
impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of raw
materials, operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation
of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely
affecting the operation of a project; administrative or judicial actions
which render contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or
impossible to perform; or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive
liabilities.


Certain Trusts may contain Bonds of issuers located in the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico or issuers which will be affected by general economic
conditions of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's unemployment rate remains
significantly higher than the U.S. unemployment rate. Furthermore, the
economy is largely dependent for its development upon U.S. policies and
programs that are being reviewed and may be eliminated.


The economy of Puerto Rico is closely integrated with that of the
mainland United States. During fiscal 1996 approximately 88% of Puerto
Rico's exports were to the U.S. mainland, which was also the source of
approximately 62% of Puerto Rico's imports. The economy of Puerto Rico
is dominated by the manufacturing and service sectors. The manufacturing
sector has experienced fundamental changes over the years as a result of
increased emphasis on higher wage, high technology industries such as
pharmaceuticals, electronics, computers, microprocessors, professional
and scientific instruments, and certain high technology machinery and
equipment. The service sector, including finance, insurance and real
estate, also plays a major role in the economy. It ranks second only to
manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic product and leads
all sectors in providing employment. In recent years, the service sector
has experienced significant growth in response to the expansion of the
manufacturing sector.


The Puerto Rican economy is affected by a number of Commonwealth and
federal investment incentive programs. Aid for Puerto Rico's economy has
traditionally depended heavily on federal programs, and current federal
budgetary policies suggest that an expansion of aid to Puerto Rico is
unlikely. An adverse effect on the Puerto Rican economy could result
from other U.S. policies, including further reduction in transfer
payment programs such as food stamps, curtailment of military spending
and policies which could lead to a stronger dollar. One of the factors
assisting the development of the Puerto Rican economy has been the tax
incentives offered by the federal and Puerto Rico governments.


Puerto Rico's future will be determined by the leadership and
initiatives of both the private and public sector to compensate for the
loss of the federal tax credit under Section 936 of the U.S. tax code.
This important credit which enabled companies to repatriate profits at a
40-60% reduction in federal taxes was terminated as of July 1996.
Existing U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico were given a ten year
grace period, but new U.S. manufacturing companies coming to Puerto Rico
will have to pay U.S. deferral taxes when repatriating their profits to
the mainland.


The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of
the financial difficulties which may impact certain issuers of Bonds and
does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all
adverse conditions to which the issuers of the Bonds are subject.
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control
of the issuers of Bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on
the financial condition of Puerto Rico and various agencies and
political subdivisions located in Puerto Rico. The Sponsor is unable to
predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may
affect the issuers of Bonds, the market value or marketability of the
Bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of the Bonds acquired by
the Trusts to pay interest on or principal of the Bonds.


Interest on certain of the Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas,
Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts will be an item of tax preference
for purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT"). The investment by
non-AMT individual taxpayers in AMT municipal bonds generally results in
a higher yield to such bondholders than non-AMT municipal bonds. Since a
portion of the interest from certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine,
Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts is an AMT preference item, certain
Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts may be
more appropriate for investors who are not subject to AMT.


Investors should be aware that many of the Bonds in the Trusts are
subject to continuing requirements such as the actual use of Bond


Page 7


proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed from Bond
proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on such Bonds from
Federal income taxation. Although at the time of issuance of each of the
Bonds in the Trusts an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the
exemption of interest on such obligations from Federal income taxation,
there can be no assurance that the respective issuers or other obligors
on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements
established upon issuance of the Bonds. A failure to comply with such
requirements may cause a determination that interest on such obligations
is subject to Federal income taxation, perhaps even retroactively from
the date of issuance of such Bonds, thereby reducing the value of the
Bonds and subjecting Unit holders to unanticipated tax liabilities.


Because certain of the Bonds may from time to time under certain
circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with
their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be
distributed to Unit holders and will not be reinvested, no assurance can
be given that a Trust will retain for any length of time its present
size and composition. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be
liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any Bond.
Certain of the Bonds contained in the Trusts may be subject to being
called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities
pursuant to optional redemption provisions, sinking fund provisions,
special or extraordinary redemption provisions or otherwise. A bond
subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or
refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A bond subject
to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from
time to time at par or, in the case of a zero coupon bond, at the
accreted value from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a
portion of an issue prior to maturity. Special or extraordinary
redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par (or for original
issue discount bonds at issue price plus the amount of original issue
discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some premium)
of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances. The exercise of redemption or call provisions will
(except to the extent the proceeds of the called Bonds are used to pay
for Unit redemptions) result in the distribution of principal and may
result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest
distributions; it may also affect the long-term return and the current
return on Units of each Trust. Redemption pursuant to call provisions is
more likely to occur, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions
may occur, when the Bonds have an offering side valuation which
represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a
premium over the accreted value. Unit holders may recognize capital gain
or loss upon any redemption or call.


Like other investment companies, financial and business organizations
and individuals around the world, the Fund could be adversely affected
if the computer systems used by the Sponsor, Evaluator, Portfolio
Supervisor or Trustee or other service providers to the Fund do not
properly process and calculate date-related information and data
involving dates of January 1, 2000 and thereafter. This is commonly
known as the "Year 2000 Problem." The Sponsor, Evaluator, Portfolio
Supervisor and Trustee are taking steps that they believe are reasonably
designed to address the Year 2000 Problem with respect to computer
systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that
comparable steps are being taken by the Fund's other service providers.
At this time, however, there can be no assurance that these steps will
be sufficient to avoid any adverse impact to the Fund. The Sponsor is
unable to predict what impact, if any, the Year 2000 Problem will have
on issuers of the Bonds contained in the Fund.


To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending as
of the date hereof in respect of any Bonds which might reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Trusts. At any time
after the date hereof, litigation may be initiated on a variety of
grounds with respect to Bonds in a Trust. Such litigation, as for
example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue
bonds under recently-enacted environmental protection statutes, may
affect the validity of such Bonds or the tax-free nature of the interest
thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be
entirely predicted, the Fund has received opinions of bond counsel to
the issuing authority of each Bond on the date of issuance to the effect
that such Bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon
is exempt from Federal income taxes and state and local taxes. In
addition, other factors may arise from time to time which potentially
may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with
respect to the Bonds.

What are Estimated Long-Term Return and Estimated Current Return?



At the date of this Prospectus, the Estimated Current Return and the
Estimated Long-Term Return, under the monthly, quarterly (if applicable)
and semi-annual (if applicable) distribution plans, are as set forth in
Part One attached hereto for each Trust. Estimated Current Return is
computed by dividing the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit
by the Public Offering Price. Any change in either amount will result in
a change in the Estimated Current Return. For each Trust, the Public
Offering Price will vary in accordance with fluctuations in the prices
of the underlying Bonds and the Net Annual Interest Income per Unit will
change as Bonds are redeemed, paid, sold or exchanged in certain
refundings or as the expenses of each Trust change. Therefore, there is
no assurance that the Estimated Current Return indicated in Part One for
each Trust will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is
calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and
determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values,
yields (which take into account the amortization of premiums and the
accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of all of the Bonds in
the Trust and (2) takes into account a compounding factor, the expenses
and sales charge associated with each Unit of a Trust. Since the market
values and estimated retirements of the Bonds and the expenses of the
Trust will change, there is no assurance that the Estimated Long-Term
Return indicated in Part One for each Trust will be realized in the
future. Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are
expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return
reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while
Estimated Current Return calculations include only Net Annual Interest
Income and Public Offering Price. Neither rate reflects the true return
to Unit holders, which is lower, because neither includes the effect of
certain delays in distributions to Unit holders.


A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current
returns and estimated long-term returns with the returns on various
taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment
decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales
materials compare the then current estimated returns on the Trust and
returns over specified periods on other similar Trusts sponsored by Nike
Securities L.P. with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or
U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and money market accounts or money
market funds, each of which has investment characteristics that may
differ from those of the Trust.



How are Purchased Interest and Accrued Interest Treated?



Purchased Interest. For The First Trust Combined Series 198-208, each
Trust contains an amount of Purchased Interest. Purchased Interest is a
portion of the unpaid interest that has accrued on the Bonds from the
later of the last payment date on the Bonds or the date of issuance
thereof through the First Settlement Date and is included in the
calculation of the Public Offering Price. Purchased Interest will be
distributed to Unit holders as Units are redeemed or Securities are
sold, mature or are called. See "Summary of Essential Information"
appearing in Part One for each Trust for the amount of Purchased
Interest per Unit for each Trust. Purchased Interest is an element of
the determination of the price Unit holders will receive in connection
with the sale or redemption of Units prior to the termination of the
Trust.


Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid
interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid.
Interest on Bonds generally is paid semi-annually, although each Trust
accrues such interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an
amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this
reason, with respect to sales settling subsequent to the First
Settlement Date, the Public Offering Price of Units will have added to
it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of
settlement. Unit holders will receive on the next distribution date of
the Trust the amount, if any, of accrued interest paid on their Units.


For The First Trust Combined Series 1-197, except through an advancement
of its own funds, the Trustee has no cash for distribution to Unit
holders until it receives interest payments on the Bonds in a Trust. The
Trustee will recover its advancements without interest or other costs to
such Trust from interest received on the Bonds in the Trust. When these
advancements have been recovered, regular distributions of interest to
Unit holders will commence. See "Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest
and Principal Distributed?" Interest account balances are established
with generally positive cash balances so that it will not be necessary
on a regular basis for the Trustee to advance its own funds in
connection with interest distributions.


Page 9


For The First Trust Combined Series 198-208, in an effort to reduce the
amount of Purchased Interest which would otherwise have to be paid by
Unit holders, the Trustee may advance a portion of the accrued interest
to the Sponsor as the Unit holder of record as of the First Settlement
Date. Consequently, the amount of accrued interest to be added to the
Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued interest from
the First Settlement Date to the date of settlement (other than the
Purchased Interest already included therein), less any distributions
from the Interest Account subsequent to the First Settlement Date. See
"Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest and Principal Distributed?"


For The First Trust Combined Series 209 and subsequent Series, in an
effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise
have to be paid in addition to the Public Offering Price in the sale of
Units to the public, the Trustee will advance the amount of accrued
interest as of the First Settlement Date and the same will be
distributed to the Sponsor as the Unit holder of record as of the First
Settlement Date. Consequently, the amount of accrued interest to be
added to the Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued
interest from the First Settlement Date to the date of settlement, less
any distributions from the Interest Account subsequent to the First
Settlement Date. See "Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest and
Principal Distributed?"


Because of the varying interest payment dates of the Bonds, accrued
interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of
interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unit holders.
If a Unit holder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he will
be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the Purchased Interest
(if any) and accrued interest from the purchaser of his Units. Since the
Trustee has the use of the funds (including Purchased Interest, if any)
held in the Interest Account for distributions to Unit holders and since
such Account is non-interest-bearing to Unit holders, the Trustee
benefits thereby.



Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?



THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO THE INSURED TRUSTS. THE
BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO OF AN ADVANTAGE TRUST ARE NOT INSURED BY
INSURANCE OBTAINED BY THE FUND.


All Bonds in the portfolio of an Insured Trust are insured as to the
scheduled payment of interest and principal by policies obtained by each
Insured Trust from Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("Financial
Guaranty" or "FGIC"), a New York stock insurance company, or AMBAC
Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity" or "AMBAC"), a Wisconsin-
domiciled stock insurance company, or obtained by the Bond issuer, the
underwriters, the Sponsor or others prior to the Initial Date of Deposit
directly from Financial Guaranty, AMBAC Indemnity or other insurers (the
"Preinsured Bonds"). The insurance policy obtained by each Insured Trust
is noncancellable and will continue in force for such Trust so long as
such Trust is in existence and the Bonds described in the policy
continue to be held by such Trust (see "Portfolio" for each Insured
Trust). Nonpayment of premiums on the policy obtained by each Insured
Trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance, but will permit
Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity to take action against the
Trustee to recover premium payments due it. Premium rates for each issue
of Bonds protected by the policy obtained by each Insured Trust are
fixed for the life of such Trust. The premium for any Preinsured Bonds
has been paid in advance by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the
Sponsor or others and any such policy or policies are noncancellable and
will continue in force so long as the Bonds so insured are outstanding
and the insurer and/or insurers thereof remain in business. If the
provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its
obligations under such policy, or if the rating assigned to the claims-
paying ability of such insurer deteriorates, Financial Guaranty and/or
AMBAC Indemnity has no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected
by either of the above described events. A monthly premium is paid by
each Insured Trust for the insurance obtained by such Trust, which is
payable from the interest income received by such Trust. In the case of
Preinsured Bonds, no premiums for insurance are paid by the Insured Trust.


Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. Under the provisions of the
aforementioned portfolio insurance issued by Financial Guaranty,
Financial Guaranty unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to
Citibank, N.A., or its successor, as its agent (the "Fiscal Agent"),
that portion of the principal of and interest on the Bonds covered by
the policy which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by
reason of nonpayment by the issuer of the Bonds. The term "due for
payment" means, when referring to the principal of a Bond, its stated
maturity date or the date on which it shall have been called for
mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to any earlier date
on which payment is due by reason of call for redemption (other than by


Page 10


mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration or other advancement of
maturity and means, when referring to interest on a Bond, the stated
date for payment of interest, except that when the interest on a Bond
shall have been determined, as provided in the underlying documentation
relating to such Bond, to be subject to Federal income taxation, "due
for payment" also means, when referring to the principal of such Bond,
the date on which such Bond has been called for mandatory redemption as
a result of such determination of taxability, and when referring to
interest on such Bond, the accrued interest at the rate provided in such
documentation to the date on which such Bond has been called for such
mandatory redemption, together with any applicable redemption premium.
The term "due for payment" will not include, when referring to either
the principal of a Bond or the interest on a Bond, any acceleration of
payment unless such acceleration is at the sole option of Financial
Guaranty.


Financial Guaranty will make such payments to the Fiscal Agent on the
date such principal or interest becomes due for payment or on the
business day next following the day on which Financial Guaranty shall
have received notice of nonpayment, whichever is later. The Fiscal Agent
will disburse to the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest
which is then due for payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by
the issuer but only upon receipt by the Fiscal Agent of (i) evidence of
the Trustee's right to receive payment of the principal or interest due
for payment and (ii) evidence, including any appropriate instruments of
assignment, that all of the rights to payment of such principal or
interest due for payment shall thereupon vest in Financial Guaranty.
Upon such disbursement, Financial Guaranty shall become the owner of the
Bond, appurtenant coupon or right to payment of principal or interest on
such Bond and shall be fully subrogated to all of the Trustee's rights
thereunder, including the right to payment thereof.


Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of Financial Guaranty, the
Trustee, upon the sale of a Bond covered under a policy obtained by an
Insured Trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect
to such Bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the Bonds regardless of the
identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of
the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in an Insured Trust is
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee
will exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such
exercise the Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of Bond
proceeds less the insurance premium attributable to the Permanent
Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such Bonds
were sold on an uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to
each Bond eligible for Permanent Insurance is determined based upon the
insurability of each Bond as of the Initial Date of Deposit and will not
be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of such
Bond.


Financial Guaranty is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FGIC Corporation (the
"Corporation"), a Delaware holding company. The Corporation is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of General Electric Capital Corporation ("GECC").
Neither the Corporation nor GECC is obligated to pay the debts of or the
claims against Financial Guaranty. Financial Guaranty is a monoline
financial guarantee insurer domiciled in the State of New York and is
subject to regulation by the State of New York Insurance Department. As
of December 31, 1997, the total capital and surplus of Financial
Guaranty was approximately $1,225,590,411. Copies of Financial
Guaranty's financial statements, prepared on the basis of statutory
accounting principles, and the Corporation's financial statements,
prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, may

The information relating to Financial Guaranty contained above has been
furnished by such corporation. The financial information contained
herein with respect to such corporation is unaudited but appears in
reports or other materials filed with state insurance regulatory
authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No
representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such
information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such
information subsequent to the date thereof.


AMBAC Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity"). The Insurance Policy of
AMBAC Indemnity obtained by an Insured Trust is noncancellable and will


Page 11


continue in force for so long as the Bonds described in the Insurance
Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by an
Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will
pay, when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the
insurance premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with AMBAC Indemnity,
in the event of a sale of a Bond covered by the AMBAC Indemnity
Insurance Policy, the Trustee has the right to obtain permanent
insurance for such Bond upon payment of a single predetermined premium
from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond.


Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, AMBAC Indemnity agrees to pay
to the Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the
Bonds insured by AMBAC Indemnity which shall become due for payment but
shall be unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer of the Bonds. The
term "due for payment" means, when referring to the principal of a Bond
so insured, its stated maturity date or the date on which it shall have
been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to
any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call for
redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption),
acceleration or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring
to interest on a Bond, the stated date for payment of interest.


AMBAC Indemnity will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty
days after notice from the Trustee is received by AMBAC Indemnity that a
nonpayment of principal or of interest on a Bond has occurred, but not
earlier than the date on which the Bonds are due for payment. AMBAC
Indemnity will disburse to the Trustee the face amount of principal and
interest which is then due for payment but is unpaid by reason of
nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for delivery of Bonds, not less in
face amount than the amount of the payment in bearer form, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In cases where
Bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to
registered holders or their assigns, AMBAC Indemnity shall pay principal
only upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid Bonds uncancelled and
free of any adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in
satisfactory form, so as to permit ownership of such Bonds to be
registered in the name of AMBAC Indemnity or its nominee. In cases where
Bonds are issuable only in a form whereby interest is payable to
registered holders or their assigns, AMBAC Indemnity shall pay interest
only upon presentation of proof that the claimant is the person entitled
to the payment of interest on the Bonds and delivery of an instrument of
assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to AMBAC Indemnity all
right under such Bonds to receive the interest in respect of which the
insurance payment was made.


AMBAC Indemnity is a Wisconsin-domiciled stock insurance corporation
regulated by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of
Wisconsin and licensed to do business in fifty states, the District of
Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, with admitted assets of
approximately $2,967,246,831 (unaudited) and statutory capital of
approximately $1,715,481,691 (unaudited) as of March 31, 1998. Statutory
capital consists of AMBAC Indemnity's policyholders' surplus and
statutory contingency reserve. AMBAC Indemnity is a wholly owned
subsidiary of AMBAC Inc., a 100% publicly-held company. Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's have both assigned a
triple-A claims-paying ability rating to AMBAC Indemnity.


On December 18, 1997, all of the outstanding shares of Construction Loan
Insurance Corporation (which previously owned all of the outstanding
shares of Connie Lee Insurance Company) were merged into Connie Lee
Holdings, Inc. ("Connie Lee"). Connie Lee is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of AMBAC Assurance Company, a Wisconsin-domiciled insurance company.


Copies of AMBAC Indemnity's financial statements prepared in accordance
with statutory accounting standards are available from AMBAC Indemnity.
The address of AMBAC Indemnity's administrative offices and its
telephone number are One State Street Plaza, 17th Floor, New York, New
York 10004 and (212) 668-0340.


The information relating to AMBAC Indemnity contained above has been
furnished by AMBAC Indemnity. No representation is made herein as to the
accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any
adverse changes in such information, subsequent to the date hereof.


In determining whether to insure bonds, Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC
Indemnity has applied its own standards which are not necessarily the
same as the criteria used in regard to the selection of bonds by the
Sponsor. This decision is made prior to the Initial Date of Deposit, as
bonds not covered by such insurance are not deposited in an Insured
Trust, unless such bonds are Preinsured Bonds. The insurance obtained by


Page 12


an Insured Trust covers Bonds deposited in such Trust and physically
delivered to the Trustee in the case of bearer bonds or registered in
the name of the Trustee or its nominee or delivered along with an
assignment in the case of registered bonds or registered in the name of
the Trustee or its nominee in the case of Bonds held in book-entry form.
Contracts to purchase Bonds are not covered by the insurance obtained by
an Insured Trust although Bonds underlying such contracts are covered by
insurance upon physical delivery to the Trustee.


Insurance obtained by each Insured Trust or by the Bond issuer, the
underwriters, the Sponsor or others does not guarantee the market value
of the Bonds or the value of the Units of such Trust. The insurance
obtained by an Insured Trust is effective only as to Bonds owned by and
held in such Trust. In the event of a sale of any such Bond by the
Trustee, the insurance terminates as to such Bond on the date of sale.
In the event of a sale of a Bond insured by an Insured Trust, the
Trustee has the right to obtain Permanent Insurance upon the payment of
an insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond. Except
as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no effect
on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention
of the Evaluator to attribute a value to such insurance obtained by an
Insured Trust (including the right to obtain Permanent Insurance) for
the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of Units only if
the Bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of
principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant risk
of such default. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of a Bond which is in default in
payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default
assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less
the insurance premium attributable to the purchase of Permanent
Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such Bonds not covered by
Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering-How is the Public Offering
Price Determined?" herein for a more complete description of the
Evaluator's method of valuing defaulted Bonds and Bonds which have a
significant risk of default. Insurance on a Preinsured Bond is effective
as long as such Bond is outstanding. Therefore, any such insurance may
be considered to represent an element of market value in regard to the
Bonds thus insured, but the exact effect, if any, of this insurance on
such market value cannot be predicted.


A contract of insurance obtained by an Insured Trust and the
negotiations in respect thereof represent the only relationship between
Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity and the Fund. Otherwise
neither Financial Guaranty nor its parent, FGIC Corporation, or any
affiliate thereof, nor AMBAC Indemnity nor its parent, AMBAC, Inc., or
any affiliate thereof has any significant relationship, direct or
indirect, with the Fund or the Sponsor, except that the Sponsor has in
the past and may from time to time in the future, in the normal course
of its business, participate as sole underwriter or as manager or as a
member of underwriting syndicates in the distribution of new issues of
municipal bonds in which the investors or the affiliates of FGIC
Corporation and/or AMBAC Inc. have or will be participants or for which
a policy of insurance guaranteeing the scheduled payment of interest and
principal has been obtained from Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC
Indemnity. Neither the Fund nor the Units of a Trust nor the portfolio
of such Trust is insured directly or indirectly by FGIC Corporation
and/or AMBAC Inc.

("Financial Security") is a monoline insurance company incorporated in
1984 under the laws of the State of New York. Financial Security is
licensed to engage in the financial guaranty insurance business in all
50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.


Financial Security and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of
writing financial guaranty insurance, principally in respect of
securities offered in domestic and foreign markets. In general,
financial guaranty insurance consists of the issuance of a guaranty of
scheduled payments of an issuer's securities, thereby enhancing the
credit rating of those securities, in consideration for payment of a
premium to the insurer. Financial Security and its subsidiaries
principally insure asset-backed, collateralized and municipal
securities. Asset-backed securities are generally supported by
residential mortgage loans, consumer or trade receivables, securities or
other assets having an ascertainable cash flow or market value.
Collateralized securities include public utility first mortgage bonds
and sale/leaseback obligation bonds. Municipal securities consist
largely of general obligation bonds, special revenue bonds and other
special obligations of state and local governments. Financial Security
insures both newly issued securities sold in the primary market and
outstanding securities sold in the secondary market that satisfy
Financial Security's underwriting criteria.


Financial Security is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security
Assurance Holdings Ltd. ("Holdings"), a New York Stock Exchange listed
company. Major shareholders of Holdings include Fund American
Enterprises Holdings, Inc., U S West Capital Corporation and The Tokio

or any of its domestic operating insurance company subsidiaries
(including FSA Maryland) are reinsured among such companies on an agreed-
upon percentage substantially proportional to their respective capital,
surplus and reserves, subject to applicable statutory risk limitations.
In addition, Financial Security and FSA Maryland reinsure a portion of
their liabilities under certain of their financial guaranty insurance
policies with other reinsurers under various quota share treaties and on
a transaction-by-transaction basis. Such reinsurance is utilized as a
risk management device and to comply with certain statutory and rating
agency requirements; it does not alter or limit the obligations of
Financial Security or FSA Maryland under any financial guaranty
insurance policy.


The claims-paying ability of Financial Security and FSA Maryland is
rated "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and "AAA" by Standard &
Poor's Rating Services, Nippon Investors Service Inc. and Standard &
Poor's (Australia) Pty. Ltd. Such ratings reflect only the views of the
respective rating agencies, are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold
securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by such
rating agencies.


Connie Lee Insurance Company. On December 18, 1997, all of the
outstanding shares of Construction Loan Insurance Corporation (which
previously owned all of the outstanding shares of Connie Lee Insurance
Company) were merged into Connie Lee Holdings, Inc. ("Connie Lee").
Connie Lee is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMBAC Assurance Company, a
Wisconsin-domiciled insurance company.


As of December 31, 1997, the total policyholders' surplus of Connie Lee
was $92,563,017 (unaudited) and total admitted assets were $233,237,273
(unaudited), as reported to the Commissioner of Insurance of the State
of Wisconsin in Connie Lee's financial statements prepared in accordance
with statutory accounting principles applicable to insurance companies.
Copies of these financial statements are available from Connie Lee upon
request.


CCLIA's consolidated annual (audited) and quarterly (unaudited)
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles are filed periodically with the Nationally
Recognized Municipal Securities Information Repositories designated
under Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
information contained in these financial statements is incorporated
herein by reference. Copies of these financial statements are available
from Connie Lee upon request.


Standard & Poor's has rated the claims-paying ability of Connie Lee "AAA".


Connie Lee makes no representation regarding the Bonds or the
advisability of investing in the Bonds. The above rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Connie Lee insured Bonds and
such rating is subject to the revision or withdrawal at any time by the
rating agency. Any downward revision or withdrawal of the rating may
have an adverse effect on the market price of the Connie Lee insured
Bonds.


The address of Connie Lee's administrative offices and its telephone
number are 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20004 and

(800) 221-1854.


Because the Bonds in each Insured Trust are insured as to the scheduled
payment of principal and interest and on the basis of the financial
condition of the insurance companies referred to above, Standard &
Poor's has assigned to units of each Insured Trust its "AAA" investment
rating. This is the highest rating assigned to securities by Standard &
Poor's. See "Description of Bond Ratings." The obtaining of this rating
by each Insured Trust should not be construed as an approval of the
offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's or as a guarantee of the
market value of each Insured Trust or the Units of such Trust. Standard
& Poor's has indicated that this rating is not a recommendation to buy,
hold or sell Units nor does it take into account the extent to which
expenses of each Trust or sales by each Trust of Bonds for less than the
purchase price paid by such Trust will reduce payment to Unit holders of
the interest and principal required to be paid on such Bonds. Such
rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the
Initial Date of Deposit of an Insured Trust and will, unless renewed,
terminate at the end of such period. There is no guarantee that the
"AAA" investment rating with respect to the Units of an Insured Trust
will be maintained.


An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by such Insured Trust is to
obtain a higher yield on the Bonds in the portfolio of such Trust than


Page 15


would be available if all the Bonds in such portfolio had the Standard &
Poor's "AAA" and/or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. "Aaa" rating(s) and
at the same time to have the protection of insurance of scheduled
payment of interest and principal on the Bonds. There is, of course, no
certainty that this result will be achieved. Bonds in a Trust for which
insurance has been obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the
Sponsor or others (all of which were rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's
and/or "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.) may or may not have a
higher yield than uninsured bonds rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's or
"Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. In selecting Bonds for the
portfolio of each Insured Trust, the Sponsor has applied the criteria
herein before described.



What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?

FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO EXEMPTION FROM STATE OR OTHER LOCAL
TAXES, SEE PART THREE FOR EACH TRUST.







What are the Expenses and Charges?



With the exception of bookkeeping and other administrative services
provided to the Trusts, for which the Sponsor will be reimbursed in
amounts as set forth under "Special Trust Information" in each Part One
of this Prospectus, the Sponsor will not receive any fee in connection
with its activities relating to the Trusts. For Series 49 and all
subsequent Series, First Trust Advisors L.P., an affiliate of the
Sponsor, will receive an annual supervisory fee, which is not to exceed
the amount set forth in Part One for each Trust, for providing portfolio
supervisory services for the Trust. Such fee is based on the number of
Units outstanding in each Trust on January 1 of each year except for
Trusts which were established subsequent to the last January 1, in which
case the fee will be based on the number of Units outstanding in such
Trusts as of the respective Initial Dates of Deposit.


For each valuation of the Bonds in a Trust, the Evaluator will receive a
fee as indicated in Part One of this Prospectus. The Trustee pays
certain expenses of each Trust for which it is reimbursed by such Trust.


The Trustee will receive for its ordinary recurring services to a Trust
an annual fee computed as indicated in Part One of this Prospectus. For
a discussion of the services performed by the Trustee pursuant to its
obligations under the Indenture, reference is made to the material set
forth under "Rights of Unit Holders."


The Trustee's and Evaluator's fees are payable monthly on or before each
Distribution Date from the Interest Account of each Trust to the extent
funds are available and then from the Principal Account of such Trust.
Since the Trustee has the use of the funds being held in the Principal
and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses and
redemptions and since such Accounts are non-interest-bearing to Unit
holders, the Trustee benefits thereby. Part of the Trustee's
compensation for its services to the Fund is expected to result from the
use of these funds. However, the Trustee may bear from its own resources
certain expenses relating to a Trust.


Each of the above mentioned fees may be increased without approval of
the Unit holders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under
the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price
Index published by the United States Department of Labor. In addition,
with respect to the fees payable to the Sponsor or an affiliate of the
Sponsor for providing bookkeeping and other administrative services and
supervisory services, such individual fees may exceed the actual costs
of providing such services for a Trust, but at no time will the total
amount received for such Services rendered to all unit investment trusts
of which Nike Securities L.P. is the Sponsor in any calendar year exceed
the actual cost to the Sponsor or its affiliate of supplying such
services in such year.


The annualized cost of the portfolio insurance obtained by the Fund for
each Insured Trust is indicated in Part One for each Trust in a Series
of the Fund. The portfolio insurance continues so long as such Trust
retains the Bonds thus insured. Premiums are payable monthly in advance
by the Trustee on behalf of such Trust. As Bonds in the portfolio are
redeemed by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the
amount of premium will be reduced in respect of those Bonds no longer
owned by and held in the Trust which were insured by insurance obtained
by such Trust. Preinsured Bonds for which insurance has been obtained


Page 16


from Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity or, beginning with Series
25 and all subsequent Series, other insurers, are not insured by such
Trust. The premium payable for Permanent Insurance will be paid solely
from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond in the event the Trustee
exercises the right to obtain Permanent Insurance on a Bond. The
premiums for such Permanent Insurance with respect to each Bond will
decline over the life of the Bond. An Advantage Trust is not insured;
accordingly, there are no premiums for insurance payable by such Trust.


The following additional charges are or may be incurred by a Trust: all
expenses (including legal and annual auditing expenses) of the Trustee
incurred in connection with its responsibilities under the Indenture,
except in the event of negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on
its part; the expenses and costs of any action undertaken by the Trustee
to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of the Unit holders;
fees of the Trustee for any extraordinary services performed under the
Indenture; indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or
expense incurred by it without negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with its
acceptance or administration of the Trust; indemnification of the
Sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as Depositor of
the Trust; all taxes and other government charges imposed upon the Bonds
or any part of the Trust (no such taxes or charges are being levied or
made or, to the knowledge of the Sponsor, are contemplated); and
expenditures incurred in contacting Unit holders upon termination of the
Trust. The above expenses and the Trustee's annual fee, when paid or
owing to the Trustee, are secured by a lien on the Trust. In addition,
the Trustee is empowered to sell Bonds of a Trust in order to make funds
available to pay all these amounts if funds are not otherwise available
in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the Trust.


Unless the Sponsor determines that such an audit is not required, the
Indenture requires the accounts of each Trust to be audited on an annual
basis at the expense of the Trust by independent auditors selected by
the Sponsor. So long as the Sponsor is making a secondary market for
Units, the Sponsor shall bear the cost of such annual audits to the
extent such cost exceeds $.50 per Unit. Unit holders of a Trust covered
by an audit may obtain a copy of the audited financial statements from
the Trustee upon request.



PUBLIC OFFERING




How is the Public Offering Price Determined?



Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to maintain a
market for the Units and continuously to offer to purchase Units at
prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid
price of the Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust plus the amount of
Purchased Interest of a Trust (if any) and interest accrued to the date
of settlement. All expenses incurred in maintaining a market, other than
the fees of the Evaluator and the costs of the Trustee in transferring
and recording the ownership of Units, will be borne by the Sponsor. If
the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for some other business reason,
the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. IF A UNIT
HOLDER WISHES TO DISPOSE OF HIS UNITS, HE SHOULD INQUIRE OF THE SPONSOR
AS TO CURRENT MARKET PRICES PRIOR TO MAKING A TENDER FOR REDEMPTION TO
THE TRUSTEE. Prospectuses relating to certain other bond funds indicate
an intention, subject to change, on the part of the respective sponsors
of such funds to repurchase units of those funds on the basis of a price
higher than the bid prices of the securities in the funds. Consequently,
depending upon the prices actually paid, the repurchase price of other
sponsors for units of their funds may be computed on a somewhat more
favorable basis than the repurchase price offered by the Sponsor for
Units of a Trust in secondary market transactions. As in the First Trust
Combined Series, the purchase price per unit of such bond funds will
depend primarily on the value of the securities in the Portfolio of the
applicable Trust.


The Public Offering Price of Units of a Trust will be determined by
adding to the Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of
the Bonds in a Trust plus the amount of Purchased Interest of a Trust
(if any) and the appropriate sales charge determined in accordance with
the schedule set forth below, based upon the number of years remaining
to the maturity of each Bond in the portfolio of the Trust, adjusting
the total to reflect the amount of any cash held in or advanced to the
principal account of the Trust and dividing the result by the number of
Units of such trust then outstanding. The minimum sales charge on Units


Page 17


will be 3% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to 3.093% of the net
amount invested). For purposes of computation, Bonds will be deemed to
mature on their expressed maturity dates unless: (a) the Bonds have been
called for redemption or funds or securities have been placed in escrow
to redeem them on an earlier call date, in which case such call date
will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature; or (b) such Bonds
are subject to a "mandatory tender," in which case such mandatory tender
will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature. The offering price
of Bonds in the Trust may be expected to be greater than the bid price
of such Bonds by approximately 1-2% of the aggregate principal amount of
such Bonds.


The effect of this method of sales charge computation will be that
different sales charge rates will be applied to each of the various
Bonds in the Trusts based upon the maturities of such bonds, in
accordance with the following schedule:








                             Secondary Offering Period Sales Charge
                             Percentage                  Percentage
                             of Public                   of Net
                             Offering                    Amount
Years to Maturity            Price                       Invested
__________________           ___________                 _________
0 Months to 1 Year           1.00%                       1.010%

2 but less than 3            2.00                        2.041
3 but less than 4            2.50                        2.564

9 but less than 10           5.50                        5.820
10 or more                   5.80                        6.157








There will be no reduction of the sales charges for volume purchases. A
dealer will receive from the Sponsor a dealer concession of 70% of the
total sales charges for Units sold by such dealer and dealers will not
be eligible for additional concessions for Units sold pursuant to the
above schedule.


An investor may aggregate purchases of Units of two or more consecutive
series of a particular State, National, Discount, Intermediate, Long
Intermediate or Short Intermediate Trust for purposes of calculating the
discount for volume purchases listed above. Additionally, with respect
to the employees, officers and directors (including their immediate
family members, defined as spouses, children, grandchildren, parents,
grandparents, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, sons-in-law and daughters-
in-law, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such
person) of the Sponsor and broker/dealers and their subsidiaries and
vendors providing services to the Sponsor, may purchase Units of the
Trusts during the secondary market at the Public Offering Price less the
concession the Sponsor typically allows broker/dealers.


Any such reduced sales charge shall be the responsibility of the selling
broker/dealer. The reduced sales charge structure will apply on all
purchases of Units in a Trust by the same person on any one day from the
Sponsor or any one broker/dealer and, for purposes of calculating the
applicable sales charge, purchases of Units in the Fund will be
aggregated with concurrent purchases by the same person from the Sponsor
or such broker/dealer of Units in any series of tax-exempt unit
investment trusts sponsored by Nike Securities L.P. Additionally, Units
purchased in the name of the spouse of a purchaser or in the name of a
child of such purchaser will be deemed, for the purpose of calculating
the applicable sales charge, to be additional purchases by the
purchaser. The reduced sales charges will also be applicable to a
trustee or other fiduciary purchasing securities for a single trust
estate or single fiduciary account.


From time to time the Sponsor may implement programs under which
broker/dealers and other selling agents of the Fund may receive nominal
awards from the Sponsor for each of their registered representatives who
have sold a minimum number of UIT Units during a specified time period.
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs
under which the sales force of broker/dealers and other selling agents
may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts,
or under which the Sponsor will reallow to any such broker/dealer or
other selling agent that sponsors sales contests or recognition programs
conforming to criteria established by the Sponsor, or participates in


Page 18


sales programs sponsored by the Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the
total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such person at
the public offering price during such programs. Also, the Sponsor in its
discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria
established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying broker/dealers and
other selling agents for certain services or activities which are
primarily intended to result in sales of Units of the Trusts. Such
payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and not out of
the assets of the Trusts. These programs will not change the price Unit
holders pay for their Units or the amount that the Trusts will receive
from the Units sold.


A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current
returns and estimated long-term returns with the returns on various
taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment
decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales
materials compare the then current estimated returns on the Trust and
returns over specified periods on other similar Trusts sponsored by Nike
Securities L.P. with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or
U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and money market accounts or money
market funds, each of which has investment characteristics that may
differ from those of the Trust. U.S. Government bonds, for example, are
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government and bank CDs
and money market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal
government. Money market accounts and money market funds provide
stability of principal, but pay interest at rates that vary with the
condition of the short-term debt market. The investment characteristics
of the Trust are described more fully elsewhere in this Prospectus.


The aggregate price of the Bonds in each Trust is determined by the
evaluator (the "Evaluator"), on the basis of bid prices (1) on the basis
of current market prices for the Bonds obtained from dealers or brokers
who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the Trust; (2)
if such prices are not available for any of the Bonds, on the basis of
current market prices for comparable bonds; (3) by determining the value
of the Bonds by appraisal; or (4) by any combination of the above.
Unless Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or, in
the Sponsor's opinion, in significant risk of such default, the
Evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an
Insured Trust. On the other hand, the value of insurance obtained by the
issuer of Bonds in a Trust is reflected and included in the market value
of such Bonds.


The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of Bonds which are in
default in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's
opinion, in significant risk of such default (the "Defaulted Bonds") and
which are covered by insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, the value
of the insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments. The value
of the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market
value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain
Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premium attributable to the
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such
Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In addition, the
Evaluator will consider the ability of Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC
Indemnity to meet its commitments under an Insured Trust's insurance
policy, including the commitments to issue Permanent Insurance. It is
the position of the Sponsor that this is a fair method of valuing the
Bonds and the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust and reflects a
proper valuation method in accordance with the provisions of the
Investment Company Act of 1940.


The Evaluator will be requested to make a determination of the aggregate
price of the Bonds in each Trust, on a bid price basis, as of the close
of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day on which it is
open, effective for all sales, purchases or redemptions made subsequent
to the last preceding determination.


Although payment is normally made three business days following the
order for purchase, payment may be made prior thereto. A person will
become owner of the Units on the date of settlement provided payment has
been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to the
date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the
Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor,
subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Delivery of Certificates representing Units so ordered will be made
three business days following such order or shortly thereafter. See
"Rights of Unit Holders-How May Units Be Redeemed?" for information
regarding the ability to redeem Units ordered for purchase.


Page 19



How are Units Distributed?



Units repurchased in the secondary market (see "Public Offering-Will
There be a Secondary Market?") may be offered by this Prospectus at the
secondary market public offering price determined in the manner
described above.


It is the intention of the Sponsor to qualify Units of the Fund for sale
in a number of states. Sales will be made to dealers and others at
prices which represent a concession or agency commission of 4.0% of the
Public Offering Price per Unit for each State, Discount or National
Trust, 3.0% of the Public Offering Price for an Intermediate or Long
Intermediate Trust, and 2.5% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for a
Short Intermediate Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, broker/dealers
or other selling agents who purchase, in the aggregate, $250,000 of the
Trusts on any day will receive a volume concession or agency commission
of $40.00 per Unit. However, resales of Units of a Trust by such
broker/dealers and other selling agents to the public will be made at
the Public Offering Price described in this Prospectus. The Sponsor
reserves the right to change the amount of the concession or agency
commission from time to time. Certain commercial banks are making Units
of the Fund available to their customers on an agency basis. A portion
of the sales charge paid by these customers is retained by or remitted
to the banks in the amounts indicated in the amounts indicated above.
Under the Glass-Steagall Act, banks are prohibited from underwriting
Units; however, the Glass-Steagall Act does permit certain agency
transactions and the banking regulators have not indicated that these
particular agency transactions are not permitted under such Act. In
Texas and in certain other states, any banks making Units available must
be registered as broker/dealers under state law.



What are the Sponsor's Profits?



The Sponsor and participating dealers will receive a maximum gross sales
commission equal to 5.8% of the Public Offering Price of the Units of
each State Trust (equivalent to 6.157% of the net amount invested), 5.8%
of the Public Offering Price of the Units of a National or Discount
Trust (equivalent to 6.157% of the net amount invested), 4.7% of the
Public Offering Price of the Units of an Intermediate or Long
Intermediate Trust (equivalent to 4.932% of the net amount invested),
and 3.7% of the Public Offering Price of the Units of a Short
Intermediate Trust (equivalent to 3.842% of the net amount invested)
less any reduced sales charge for quantity purchases as described under
"Public Offering-How is the Public Offering Price Determined?"


In maintaining a market for the Units, the Sponsor will also realize
profits or sustain losses in the amount of any difference between the
price at which Units are purchased (based on the bid prices of the Bonds
in each Trust) and the price at which Units are resold (which price is
also based on the bid prices of the Bonds in each Trust and includes a
maximum sales charge of 5.8% for a State Trust, 5.8% for a National or
Discount Trust, 4.7% for an Intermediate or Long Intermediate Trust and
3.7% for a Short Intermediate Trust) or redeemed. The secondary market
public offering price of Units may be greater or less than the cost of
such Units to the Sponsor.



RIGHTS OF UNIT HOLDERS




How are Certificates Issued and Transferred?



The Trustee is authorized to treat as the record owner of Units that
person who is registered as such owner on the books of the Trustee.
Ownership of Units is evidenced by registered certificates executed by
the Trustee and the Sponsor. Delivery of certificates representing Units
ordered for purchase is normally made three business days following such
order or shortly thereafter. Certificates are transferable by
presentation and surrender to the Trustee properly endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer.
Certificates to be redeemed must be properly endorsed or accompanied by
a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unit holder must sign
exactly as his name appears on the face of the certificate with the
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in
addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the
Trustee. In certain instances the Trustee may require additional
documents such as, but not limited to, trust instruments, certificates
of death, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates of
corporate authority. Record ownership may occur before settlement.


Page 20


Certificates will be issued in fully registered form, transferable only
on the books of the Trustee in denominations of one Unit or any multiple
thereof, numbered serially for purposes of identification. Certificates
for Units will bear an appropriate notation on their face indicating
which plan of distribution has been selected in respect thereof. When a
change is made, the existing certificate must be surrendered to the
Trustee and a new certificate issued to reflect the then currently
effective plan of distribution. There is no charge for this service.


Although no such charge is now made or contemplated, a Unit holder may
be required to pay $2.00 to the Trustee per certificate reissued or
transferred for reasons other than to change the plan of distribution,
and to pay any governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with each such transfer or exchange. For new certificates issued to
replace destroyed, stolen or lost certificates, the Unit holder may be
required to furnish indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee and pay such
expenses as the Trustee may incur. Mutilated certificates must be
surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.



How are Interest and Principal Distributed?



Record Dates for the distribution of interest under the semi-annual
distribution plan are the fifteenth day of June and December with the
Distribution Dates being the last day of the month in which the related
Record Date occurs. It is anticipated that an amount equal to
approximately one-half of the amount of net annual interest income per
Unit will be distributed on or shortly after each Distribution Date to
Unit holders of record on the preceding Record Date. Record Dates for
monthly distributions of interest are the fifteenth day of each month.
The Distribution Dates for distributions of interest under the monthly
plan is the last day of each month in which the related Record Date
occurs. See "Special Trust Information" appearing in each Part I of this
Prospectus.


The plan of distribution selected by a Unit holder will remain in effect
until changed. Unit holders purchasing Units in the secondary market
will initially receive distributions in accordance with the election of
the prior owner. Each year, approximately six weeks prior to the end of
May, the Trustee will furnish each Unit holder a card to be returned to
the Trustee not more than thirty nor less than ten days before the end
of such month. Unit holders desiring to change the plan of distribution
in which they are participating may so indicate on the card and return
same, together with their certificate, to the Trustee. If the card and
certificate are returned to the Trustee, the change will become
effective as of June 16 of that year. If the card and certificate are
not returned to the Trustee, the Unit holder will be deemed to have
elected to continue with the same plan for the following twelve months.


The pro rata share of cash in the Principal Account of each Trust will
be computed as of the fifteenth day of each month, and distributions to
the Unit holders of such Trust as of such Record Date will be made on
the dates specified in Part One. Proceeds from the disposition of any of
the Bonds of such Trust (less any premiums due with respect to Bonds for
which the Trustee has exercised the right to obtain Permanent Insurance)
received after such Record Date and prior to the following Distribution
Date will be held in the Principal Account of such Trust and not
distributed until the next Distribution Date. The Trustee is not
required to make a distribution from the Principal Account of a Trust
unless the amount available for distribution shall equal at least $1.00
per Unit.


The Trustee will credit to the Interest Account of each Trust all
interest received by such Trust, including that part of the proceeds
(including insurance proceeds if any, paid to an Insured Trust) of any
disposition of Bonds which represents accrued interest. Other receipts
will be credited to the Principal Account of such Trust. The
distribution to the Unit holders of a Trust as of each Record Date will
be made on the following Distribution Date or shortly thereafter and
shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of the
holder's pro rata share of the estimated annual income of such Trust
after deducting estimated expenses. Except through an advancement of its
own Funds, the Trustee has no cash for distribution to Unit holders
until it receives interest payments on the Bonds in a Trust. The Trustee
shall be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from funds
in the Interest Account of such Trust on the ensuing Record Date.
Persons who purchase Units between a Record Date and a Distribution Date
will receive their first distribution on the second Distribution Date
after the purchase, under the applicable plan of distribution. The
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal
or Interest Account of a Trust (but may itself earn interest thereon and
therefore benefit from the use of such funds).


Page 21


As of the fifteenth day of each month, the Trustee will deduct from the
Interest Account of each Trust and, to the extent funds are not
sufficient therein, from the Principal Account of each Trust, amounts
necessary to pay the expenses of such Trust. The Trustee also may
withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary
to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the
Trust. Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of the
Trust's assets until such time as the Trustee shall return all or any
part of such amounts to the appropriate account. In addition, the
Trustee may withdraw from the Interest Account and the Principal Account
of a Trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemption of Units
of such Trust by the Trustee.



How Can Distributions to Unit Holders be Reinvested?



Universal Distribution Option. Unit holders may elect participation in a
Universal Distribution Option which permits a Unit holder to direct the
Trustee to distribute principal and interest payments to any other
investment vehicle of which the Unit holder has an existing account. For
example, at a Unit holder's direction, the Trustee would distribute
automatically on the applicable distribution date interest income or
principal on the participant's Units to, among other investment
vehicles, a Unit holder's checking, bank savings, money market,
insurance, reinvestment or any other account. All such distributions, of
course, are subject to the minimum investment and sales charges, if any,
of the particular investment vehicle to which distributions are
directed. The Trustee will notify the participant of each distribution
pursuant to the Universal Distribution Option. The Trustee will
distribute directly to the Unit holder any distributions which are not
accepted by the specified investment vehicle. A participant may at any
time, by so notifying the Trustee in writing, elect to terminate his
participation in the Universal Distribution Option and receive directly
future distributions on his Units.


Distribution Reinvestment Option. The Sponsor has entered into an
arrangement with Oppenheimer Management Corporation, which permits any
Unit holder of a Trust to elect to have each distribution of interest
income or principal on his Units automatically reinvested in shares of
either the Oppenheimer Intermediate Tax-Exempt Bond Fund (the
"Intermediate Series") or the Oppenheimer Insured Tax-Exempt Bond Fund
(the "Insured Series"). Oppenheimer Management Corporation is the
investment adviser of each Series which are open-end, diversified
management investment companies. The investment objective of the
Intermediate Series is to provide a high level of current interest
income exempt from Federal income tax through the purchase of investment
grade securities. The investment objective of the Insured Series is to
provide as high a level of current interest income exempt from Federal
income tax as is consistent with the assurance of the scheduled receipt
of interest and principal through insurance and the preservation of
capital (the income of either Series may constitute an item of
preference for determining the Federal alternative minimum tax). The
objectives and policies of each Series are presented in more detail in
the prospectus for each Series.


Each person who purchases Units of a Trust may contact the Trustee to
request a prospectus describing each Series and a form by which such
person may elect to become a participant in a Distribution Reinvestment
Option with respect to a Series. Each distribution of interest income or
principal on the participant's Units will automatically be applied by
the Trustee to purchase shares (or fractions thereof) of a Series
without a sales charge and with no minimum investment requirements.


The shareholder service agent for each Series will mail to each
participant in the Distribution Reinvestment Option confirmations of all
transactions undertaken for such participant in connection with the
receipt of distributions from The First Trust Combined Series and the
purchase of shares (or fractions thereof) of a Series.


A participant may at any time, by so notifying the Trustee in writing,
elect to terminate his participation in the Distribution Reinvestment
Option and receive future distributions on his Units in cash. There will
be no charge or other penalty for such termination. The Sponsor and
Oppenheimer Management Corporation each have the right to terminate the
Distribution Reinvestment Option, in whole or in part.


It should be remembered that even if distributions are reinvested
through the Universal Distribution Option or the Distribution
Reinvestment Option they are still treated as distributions for income
tax purposes.

What Reports Will Unit Holders Receive?



The Trustee shall furnish Unit holders of each Trust in connection with
each distribution a statement of the amount of interest, if any, and the
amount of other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed
in each case as a dollar amount per Unit. Within a reasonable time after
the last business day of each calendar year, the Trustee will furnish to
each person who at any time during the calendar year was a Unit holder
of a Trust of record, a statement as to (1) the Interest Account:

interest received by such Trust (including amounts representing interest
received upon any disposition of Bonds of such Trust), the amount of
such interest representing insurance proceeds (if applicable),
deductions for payment of applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of
the Trust, redemption of Units and the balance remaining after such
distributions and deductions, expressed both as a total dollar amount
and as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit
outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year; (2) the
Principal Account: the dates of disposition of any Bonds of such Trust
and the net proceeds received therefrom (excluding any portion
representing interest and the premium attributable to the exercise of
the right, if applicable, to obtain Permanent Insurance), deduction for
payment of applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of the Trust,
redemptions of Units, and the balance remaining after such distributions
and deductions, expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar
amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding on the
last business day of such calendar year; (3) the Bonds held and the
number of Units of such Trust outstanding on the last business day of
such calendar year; (4) the Redemption Price per Unit based upon the
last computation thereof made during such calendar year; and (5) the
amounts actually distributed during such calendar year from the Interest
Account and from the Principal Account of such Trust, separately stated,
expressed both as total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per Unit
outstanding on the Record Date for such distributions.


In order to comply with Federal and state tax reporting requirements,
Unit holders will be furnished, upon request to the Trustee, evaluations
of the Bonds in their Trust furnished to it by the Evaluator.


Each distribution statement will reflect pertinent information in
respect of each plan of distribution so that Unit holders may be
informed regarding the results of the other plan or plans of distribution.



How May Units be Redeemed?



A Unit holder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by tender to the
Trustee at its unit investment trust office in the City of New York of
the certificates representing the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or
accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with signature guaranteed
as explained above (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, as in
connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates), and payment of
applicable governmental charges, if any. No redemption fee will be
charged. On the third day following such tender, the Unit holder will be
entitled to receive in cash an amount for each Unit equal to the
Redemption Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of
such tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on
which Units are received by the Trustee (if such day is a day on which
the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading), except that as regards
Units received after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange
(generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a
day on which the New York Stock Exchange is scheduled in advance to
close at such earlier time), the date of tender is the next day on which
such Exchange is open for trading and such Units will be deemed to have
been tendered to the Trustee on such day for redemption at the
redemption price computed on that day. Units so redeemed shall be
cancelled.


Purchased Interest (if any) and other accrued interest to the settlement
date paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account of
a Trust or, if the balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal
Account of such Trust. All other amounts paid on redemption shall be
withdrawn from the Principal Account of the Trust.


The Redemption Price per Unit will be determined on the basis of the bid
price of the Bonds in a Trust and the amount of Purchased Interest of
the Trust (if any), as of the close of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange on the date any such determination is made. The Redemption Price
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit determined by the Trustee on
the basis of (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or moneys in the process
of being collected, (2) the value of the Bonds in such Trust based on
the bid prices of the Bonds, except for those cases in which the value
of the insurance, if applicable, has been added, and (3) Purchased


Page 23


Interest (if any) and any other interest accrued thereon, less (a)
amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of
such Trust, (b) the accrued expenses of such Trust, and (c) cash held
for distribution to Unit holders of record as of a date prior to the
evaluation then being made. The Evaluator may determine the value of the
Bonds in a Trust (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the Bonds
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds
comparable to those held by such Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices
for bonds comparable to any Bonds for which bid prices are not
available, (3) by determining the value of the Bonds by appraisal, or

(4) by any combination of the above. In determining the Redemption Price
per Unit for an Insured Trust, no value will be attributed to the
portfolio insurance covering the Bonds in such Trust unless such Bonds
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant
risk of such default. On the other hand, Bonds insured under a policy
obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others are
entitled to the benefits of such insurance at all times and such
benefits are reflected and included in the market value of such Bonds.
See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?" For a description of
the situations in which the evaluator may value the insurance obtained
by an Insured Trust, see "Public Offering-How is the Public Offering
Price Determined?"


The difference between the bid and offering prices of such Bonds may be
expected to average 1-2% of the principal amount. In the case of
actively traded bonds, the difference may be as little as 1/2 of 1% and,
in the case of inactively traded bonds, such difference usually will not
exceed 3%. Therefore, the price at which Units may be redeemed could be
less than the price paid by the Unit holder and may be less than the par
value of the Securities represented by the Units so redeemed.


The Trustee is empowered to sell underlying Bonds in a Trust in order to
make funds available for redemption. To the extent that Bonds are sold,
the size and diversity of such Trust will be reduced. Such sales may be
required at a time when Bonds would not otherwise be sold and might
result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than
for customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the
Securities and Exchange Commission determines that trading on that
Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of which
disposal or evaluation of the Bonds is not reasonably practicable, or
for such other periods as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by
order permit. Under certain extreme circumstances, the Sponsor may apply
to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an order permitting a full
or partial suspension of the right of Unit holders to redeem their Units.



How May Units be Purchased by the Sponsor?



The Trustee shall notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for
redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the secondary market at that time
equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit, which for certain
Trusts includes Purchased Interest, it may purchase such Units by
notifying the Trustee before 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on the next
succeeding business day and by making payment therefor to the Unit
holder not later than the day on which the Units would otherwise have
been redeemed by the Trustee. Units held by the Sponsor may be tendered
to the Trustee for redemption as any other Units. Any profit or loss
resulting from the resale or redemption of such Units will belong to the
Sponsor.



How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?



The Trustee is empowered to sell such of the Bonds in each Trust on a
list furnished by the Sponsor as the Trustee in its sole discretion may
deem necessary to meet redemption requests or pay expenses to the extent
funds are unavailable. As described in the following paragraph and in
certain other unusual circumstances for which it is determined by the
Depositor to be in the best interests of the Unit holders or if there is
no alternative, the Trustee is empowered to sell Bonds in a Trust which
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant
risk of such default and for which value has been attributed to the
insurance, if any, obtained by the Trust. See "Rights of Unit Holders-
How May Units be Redeemed?" The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated,
to direct the Trustee to dispose of Bonds in a Trust in the event of
advanced refunding. The Sponsor may from time to time act as agent for a
Trust with respect to selling Bonds out of a Trust. From time to time,
the Trustee may retain and pay compensation to the Sponsor subject to
the restrictions under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.


Page 24


If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any Bond
occurs and no provision for payment is made therefor, either pursuant to
the portfolio insurance, if any, or otherwise, within thirty days, the
Trustee is required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails
to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold such Bond within thirty days
after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the
Trustee may, in its discretion, sell the defaulted Bond and not be
liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.


The Sponsor shall instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by an
issuer of any of the Bonds to issue new obligations in exchange and
substitution for any Bonds pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan,
except that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept such an offer
or to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem
proper if the issuer is in default with respect to such Bonds or in the
written opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default in
respect to such Bonds in the foreseeable future. Any obligations so
received in exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject
to the terms and conditions in the Indenture to the same extent as Bonds
originally deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of
obligations in exchange or substitution for underlying Bonds, the
Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each Unit holder of the
affected Trust, identifying the Bonds eliminated and the Bonds
substituted therefor. Except as stated in this paragraph and under "What
is the First Trust Combined Series?" for Failed Bonds, the acquisition
by a Trust of any securities other than the Bonds initially deposited is
prohibited.

Limitations on Liabilities of Sponsor and Trustee



The Sponsor and the Trustee shall be under no liability to Unit holders
for taking any action or for refraining from taking any action in good
faith pursuant to the Indenture, or for errors in judgment, but shall be
liable only for their own willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
negligence (ordinary negligence in the case of the Trustee) or reckless
disregard of their obligations and duties. The Trustee shall not be

OTHER INFORMATION




How May the Indenture be Amended or Terminated?



The Sponsor and the Trustee have the power to amend the Indenture
without the consent of any of the Unit holders when such an amendment is

(1) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision of
the Indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other
provision contained therein, or (2) to make such other provisions as
shall not adversely affect the interest of the Unit holders (as
determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee), provided that
the Indenture is not amended to increase the number of Units of any
Trust issuable thereunder or to permit the deposit or acquisition of
securities either in addition to or in substitution for any of the Bonds
of any Trust initially deposited in a Trust, except for the substitution
of certain refunding securities for Bonds or New Bonds for Failed Bonds.
In the event of any amendment, the Trustee is obligated to notify
promptly all Unit holders of the substance of such amendment.


Each Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of 100% of the Unit
holders of such Trust or by the Trustee when the value of such Trust, as
shown by any evaluation, is less than 20% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Bonds initially deposited in the Trust or by the Trustee
in the event that Units of a Trust not yet sold aggregating more than
60% of the Units of such Trust are tendered for redemption by the
Underwriters, including the Sponsor. If a Trust is liquidated because of
the redemption of unsold Units of the Trust by the Underwriters, the


Page 26


Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units of such Trust the entire
sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Indenture will terminate upon
the redemption, sale or other disposition of the last Bond held
thereunder, but in no event shall it continue beyond the Mandatory
Termination Date as indicated in Part One for each Trust. In the event
of termination, written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to
all Unit holders of such Trust. Within a reasonable period after
termination, the Trustee will sell any Bonds remaining in the Trust,
and, after paying all expenses and charges incurred by such Trust, will
distribute to each Unit holder of such Trust (including the Sponsor if
it then holds any Units), upon surrender for cancellation of his
Certificate for Units, his pro rata share of the balances remaining in
the Interest and Principal Accounts of such Trust, all as provided in
the Indenture.

DESCRIPTION OF BOND RATINGS*



Standard & Poor's. A brief description of the applicable Standard &
Poor's rating symbols and their meanings follow:


A Standard & Poor's corporate or municipal bond rating is a current
assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a
specific debt obligation. This assessment may take into consideration
obligors such as guarantors, insurers, or lessees.


The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a
security, inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or
suitability for a particular investor.


The ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or
obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers reliable.
Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection with any
rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial information.
The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of
changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or for other
circumstances.


The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following
considerations:


l.   Likelihood of default-capacity and willingness of the obligor as to
the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance
with the terms of the obligation;


ll.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation;


lll. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


AAA-Bonds rated AAA have the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay
principal is extremely strong.**


AA-Bonds rated AA have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay
principal and differ from the highest rated issues only in small degree.


A-Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay
principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds
in higher rated categories.


BBB-Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate
protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing
circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay
interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds
in higher rated categories.


Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by
the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within
the major rating categories.


Provisional Ratings: The letter "p" indicates that the rating is
provisional. A provisional rating assumes the successful completion of
the project being financed by the bonds being rated and indicates that
payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent
upon the successful and timely completion of the project. This rating,
however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the
project, makes no comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default
upon failure of, such completion. The investor should exercise his/her
own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk.


Credit Watch: Credit Watch highlights potential changes in ratings of
bonds and other fixed income securities. It focuses on events and trends
which place companies and government units under special surveillance by
S&P's 180-member analytical staff. These may include mergers, voter
referendums, actions by regulatory authorities, or developments gleaned
from analytical reviews. Unless otherwise noted, a rating decision will
be made within 90 days. Issues appear on Credit Watch where an event,
situation, or deviation from trends occurred and needs to be evaluated
as to its impact on credit ratings. A listing, however, does not mean a
rating change is inevitable. Since S&P continuously monitors all of its
ratings, Credit Watch is not intended to include all issues under
review. Thus, rating changes will occur without issues appearing on
Credit Watch.




*As published by the rating companies.


**Bonds insured by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, AMBAC Indemnity
Corporation, Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, Connie Lee
Insurance Company, Financial Security Assurance and Capital Guaranty
Insurance Company are automatically rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's.


Page 28


Moody's Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings follow:


Aaa-Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They
carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred
to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or by an
exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the various
protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be
visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position
of such issues. Their safety is so absolute that with the occasional
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances, characteristically,
their market value is affected solely by money market fluctuations.


Aa-Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally
known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds
because margins of protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities
or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or
there may be other elements present which make the long term risks
appear somewhat large than in Aaa securities. Their market value is
virtually immune to all but money market influences, with the occasional
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances.


A-Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes
and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors
giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate, but
elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment
sometime in the future. The market value of A-rated bonds may be
influenced to some degree by economic performance during a sustained
period of depressed business conditions, but, during periods of
normalcy, A-rated bonds frequently move in parallel with Aaa and Aa
obligations, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few
specific instances.


A 1 and Baa 1-Bonds which are rated A 1 and Baa 1 offer the maximum in
security within their quality group, can be bought for possible
upgrading in quality, and additionally, afford the investor an
opportunity to gauge more precisely the relative attractiveness of
offerings in the market place.


Baa-Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade
obligations; i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured.
Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present
but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be
characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such bonds
lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative
characteristics as well. The market value of Baa-rated bonds is more
sensitive to changes in economic circumstances, and aside from
occasional speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class, Baa
market valuations will move in parallel with Aaa, Aa, and A obligations
during periods of economic normalcy, except in instances of oversupply.


Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at
the high end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range
ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower
end of its generic rating category.


Con.(---)-Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of
some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally.
These are bonds secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction,

(b) earnings of projects unseasoned in operation experience, (c) rentals
which begin when facilities are completed, or (d) payments to which some
other limiting condition attaches. Parenthetical rating denotes probable
credit stature upon completion of construction or elimination of basis
of condition.


Fitch Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable
Fitch Investors Service, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings follow:


AAA-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit
quality. The obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest
and repay principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably
foreseeable events.


AA-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit
quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is
very strong, although not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA. Bonds
rated in the AAA and AA categories are not significantly vulnerable to
foreseeable future developments.


A-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality.
The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered
to be strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic
conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.


BBB-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit
quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is


Page 29


considered to be adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and
circumstances, however, are more likely to have adverse impact on these
bonds, and therefore impair timely payment. The likelihood that the
ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than
for bonds with higher ratings.


To provide more detailed indications of credit quality, the AA, A and
BBB ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to
show relative standing within these major rating categories.

Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders



At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from
Federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective
issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to State Trusts, where
applicable, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as
to the exemption of interest on such Bonds when held by residents of the
State in which the issuers of such Bonds are located, from State income
taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes.
Neither the Sponsor, Chapman and Cutler, nor any of the Special Counsel
to the Fund for State tax matters have made any special review for the
Fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the
bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith. If the interest
on a Bond should be determined to be taxable, the Bond would generally
have to be sold at a substantial discount. In addition, investors could
be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on
which interest is determined to be taxable.


Gain realized on the sale or redemption of the Bonds by the Trustee or
of a Unit by a Unit holder is includable in gross income for Federal
income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax
purposes. (Such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of
accrued interest or accrued original issue discount, if any.) If a Bond
is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price paid for
the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond. When this
accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of capital and
reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased for a premium,
the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the Bond. Bond
premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond, and the tax
basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium
amortized in that tax year.


For purposes of the following opinions, it is assumed that each asset of
the Trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income
for Federal income tax purposes. At the time of the closing for each
Trust, Chapman and Cutler, Counsel for the Sponsor, rendered an opinion
under then existing law substantially to the effect that:


(1)   the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for
Federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue
discount on Bonds which is excludable from gross income under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") will retain its status for
Federal income tax purposes, when received by the Trusts and distributed
to a Unit holder; however, such interest may be taken into account in
computing the alternative minimum tax and the additional tax on branches
of foreign corporations and the environmental tax (the "Superfund Tax"),
as noted below. See "Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit
Holders";



ALL PARTS OF THE PROSPECTUS SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.



THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY
OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

(2)   each Unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata
portion of each asset of the respective Trust under subpart E,
subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code and will have a taxable event when
the Trust disposes of a Bond, or when the Unit holder redeems or sells
his Units. If the Unit holder disposes of a Unit, he is deemed thereby
to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the
Trust involved including his pro rata portion of all the Bonds
represented by the Unit. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (the "1997
Act") includes provisions that treat certain transactions designed to
reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain (e.g. short
sales, offsetting notional principal contracts, futures or forward
contracts or similar transactions) as constructive sales for purposes of
recognition of gain (but not loss) and for purposes of determining the
holding period. Unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with
regard to any such constructive sale rules. Unit holders must reduce the
tax basis of their Units for their share of accrued interest received by
the respective Trust, if any, on Bonds before the date the Trust
acquired ownership of the Bonds (and the amount of this reduction may
exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller) and,
consequently, such Unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or
reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such Units. Gain or
loss upon the sale or redemption of Units is measured by comparing the
proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the
Units. If the Trustee disposes of Bonds (whether by sale, payment on
maturity, redemption or otherwise), gain or loss is recognized to the
Unit holder (subject to various non-recognition provisions of the Code).
The amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the Unit
holder's pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with
the Unit holder's basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset
disposed of. In the case of a Unit holder who purchases Units, such
basis (before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and
amortized bond premium, if any) is determined by apportioning the cost
of the Units among each of the Trust assets ratably according to value
as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the Units.
Unit holders should consult their own tax advisers with regard to the
calculation of basis. The tax basis reduction requirements of the Code
relating to amortization of bond premium may, under some circumstances,
result in the Unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his Units are
sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost;
and


(3)  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by
issuers of Bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds
held by the Trustee will be excludable from Federal gross income if, and
to the same extent as, such interest would have been so excludable if
paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted Bonds provided
that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such
policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable
expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer, will
pay debt service on the Bonds.


Sections 1288 and 1272 of the Code provide a complex set of rules
governing the accrual of original issue discount. These rules provide
that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant
compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the Bond, depending
on the date the Bond was issued. In addition, special rules apply if the
purchase price of a Bond exceeds the original issue price plus the
amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued
based upon its issue price (its "adjusted issue price") to prior owners.
If a Bond is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price
paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond.
When this accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of
capital and reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased
for a premium, the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of
the Bond. Bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond,
and the tax basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of
the premium amortized in that tax year. The application of these rules
will also vary depending on the value of the Bond on the date a Unit
holder acquires his Unit, and the price the Unit holder pays for his
Unit. Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these
rules and their application. See "Portfolio" appearing in Part One for
each Trust for information relating to Bonds, if any, issued at an
original issue discount.


The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the "Tax Act") subjects tax-
exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the Code effective for
bonds purchased after April 30, 1993. In general, market discount is the
amount (if any) by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds
an investor's purchase price (except to the extent that such difference,


Page 2


if any, is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued),
subject to statutory de minimis rule. Market discount can arise based on
the price a Trust pays for Bonds or the price a Unit holder pays for his
or her Units. Under the Tax Act, accretion of market discount is taxable
as ordinary income; under prior law the accretion had been treated as
capital gain. Market discount that accretes while a Trust holds a Bond
would be recognized as ordinary income by the Unit holders when
principal payments are received on the Bond, upon sale or at redemption
(including early redemption) or upon the sale or redemption of his or
her Units, unless a Unit holder elects to include market discount in
taxable income as it accrues. The market discount rules are complex and
Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and
their application.


Counsel for the Sponsor has also advised that under Section 265 of the
Code, interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or
carry Units of a Trust is not deductible for Federal income tax
purposes. The Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that such
indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying
of Units (however, these rules generally do not apply to interest paid
on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence).
Also, under Section 265 of the Code, certain financial institutions that
acquire Units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest
expense attributable to ownership of Units. Legislative proposals have
been made that would extend the financial institution rules to certain
other corporations including securities dealers and other financial
intermediaries. Investors with questions regarding these issues should
consult with their tax advisers.


In the case of certain of the Bonds in a Trust, the opinions of bond
counsel indicate that interest on such Bonds received by a "substantial
user" of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these Bonds,
or persons related thereto, for periods while such Bonds are held by
such a user or related person, will not be excludable from Federal gross
income, although interest on such Bonds received by others would be
excludable from Federal gross income. "Substantial user" and "related
person" are defined under the Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations. Any
person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related
person as so defined should contact his tax adviser.


ALL STATEMENTS OF LAW IN THE PROSPECTUS CONCERNING EXCLUSION FROM GROSS
INCOME FOR FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER TAX PURPOSES ARE THE OPINIONS OF
COUNSEL AND ARE TO BE SO CONSTRUED.


At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from
Federal gross income are rendered by bond counsel to the respective
issuing authorities. Neither the Sponsor nor Chapman and Cutler has made
any special review for the Fund of the proceedings relating to the
issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for such opinions.


In general, Section 86 of the Code provides that 50% of Social Security
benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of
"modified adjusted gross income" plus 50% of the Social Security
benefits received exceeds the "base amount." The base amount is $25,000
for unmarried taxpayers, $32,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint
return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times
during the taxable year and who file separate returns. Modified adjusted
gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to
certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income
and by including tax-exempt interest. To the extent that Social Security
benefits are includible in gross income, they will be treated as any
other item of gross income.


In addition, under the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after
December 31 1993, up to 85% of Social Security benefits are includible
in gross income to the extent that the sum of "modified adjusted gross
income" plus 50% of Social Security benefits received exceeds an
"adjusted base amount." The adjusted base amount is $34,000 for
unmarried taxpayers, $44,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint
return, and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all
times during the taxable year and who file separate returns.


Although tax-exempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross
income solely for the purpose of determining what portion, if any, of
Social Security benefits will be included in gross income, no tax-exempt
interest, including that received from a Trust, will be subject to tax.
A taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount
or the adjusted base amount must include 50% or 85%, respectively, of
his Social Security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives
any tax-exempt interest. A taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income
(after inclusion of tax-exempt interest) does not exceed the base amount
need not include any Social Security benefits in gross income.


Page 3


For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals
and corporations, interest on certain private activity bonds (which
includes most industrial and housing revenue bonds) issued on or after
August 8, 1986 is included as an item of tax preference. EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE NOTED IN PART ONE FOR CERTAIN TRUSTS, THE TRUSTS DO NOT
INCLUDE ANY SUCH PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS ISSUED ON OR AFTER THAT DATE.


For taxpayers other than corporations, net capital gains (which is
defined as net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss
for the taxable year) are subject to a maximum marginal stated tax rate
of either 28% or 20%, depending upon the holding period of the capital
assets. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the holding period for the
asset is more than one year, and is short-term if the holding period for
the asset is one year or less. Generally, capital gain realized from
assets held for more than one year but not more than 18 months are taxed
at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 28% and capital gains realized
from assets (with certain exclusions) held for more than 18 months are
taxed at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 20% (10% in the case of
certain taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket). Further, capital gains
realized from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same
rate as ordinary income. Legislation is currently pending that provides
the appropriate methodology that should be applied in netting the
realized capital gains and losses. Such legislation is proposed to be
effective retroactively for tax years ending after May 6, 1997. The date
on which a Unit is acquired (i.e., the "trade date") is excluded for
purposes of determining the holding period of the Unit. It should be
noted that legislative proposals are introduced from time to time that
affect tax rates and could affect relative differences at which ordinary
income and capital gains are taxed.


In addition, please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as
ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are
considered "conversion transactions" effective for transactions entered
into after April 30, 1993. Unit holders and prospective investors should
consult with their tax advisers regarding the potential effect of this
provision on their investment in Units.


Under the Code, taxpayers must disclose to the Internal Revenue Service
the amount of tax-exempt interest earned during the year.


Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit Holders. In the case of
certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax and the Superfund Tax
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986 depend upon the
corporation's alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is the
corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the
adjustment items used in computing AMTI of a corporation (other than an
S Corporation, Regulated Investment Company, Real Estate Investment
Trust, or REMIC) is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such
corporation's "adjusted current earnings" over an amount equal to its
AMTI (before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating
loss deduction). "Adjusted current earnings" includes all tax-exempt
interest, including interest on all of the Bonds in the Trusts. Under
current Code provisions, the Superfund Tax does not apply to tax years
beginning on or after January 1, 1996. Legislative proposals have been
introduced that would reinstate the Superfund Tax for taxable years
beginning after December 31, 1997 and before January 1, 2009. Under the
provisions of Section 884 of the Code, a branch profits tax is levied on
the "effectively connected earnings and profits" of certain foreign
corporations which include tax-exempt interest such as interest on the
Bonds in the Trust. Unit holders should consult their tax advisers with
respect to the particular tax consequences to them, including the
corporate alternative minimum tax, the Superfund Tax and the branch
profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the Code.


Ownership of the Units may result in collateral federal income tax
consequences to certain taxpayers, including, without limitation,
corporations, subject to the branch profits tax, financial institutions,
certain insurance companies, certain S corporations, individual
recipients of Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and
taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred (or continued) indebtedness
to purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisers as to the applicability of any such
collateral consequences.


At the time of the closing, Winston & Strawn (previously named Cole &
Deitz), Special Counsel to Series 4-125 of the Fund for New York tax
matters, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax laws of the
State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that each Trust
in Series 4-125 of the Fund is not an association taxable as a
corporation and the income of each Trust in Series 4-125 of the Fund


Page 4


will be treated as the income of the Unit holder in the same manner as
for Federal income tax purposes (subject to differences in accounting
for discount and premium to the extent the State and/or City of New York
do not conform to current Federal law).


At the time of the closing, Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, Special Counsel
to the Fund for New York tax matters for Series 126 and subsequent
Series of the Fund, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax
laws of the State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that
each Trust will not constitute an association taxable as a corporation
under New York law, and accordingly will not be subject to the New York
State franchise tax or the New York City general corporation tax. Under
the income tax laws of the State and City of New York, the income of
each Trust will be considered the income of the holders of the Units.


All statements in the Prospectus concerning exclusion from gross income
for Federal, state or other are the opinions of Counsel and are to be so
construed.



Ohio Tax Status of Unit Holders



Each Ohio Insured Trust is comprised of interest-bearing obligations
issued by or on behalf of the State of Ohio, political subdivisions
thereof, or agencies or instrumentalities thereof ("Ohio Obligations"),
or by the governments of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or Guam
(collectively, "Territorial Obligations"). At the time of the closing
for each Ohio Trust, Special Counsel to the Fund for Ohio tax matters
rendered an opinion under then existing Ohio income tax law applicable
to taxpayers whose income is subject to Ohio income taxation
substantially to the effect that:


Each Ohio Insured Trust is not taxable as a corporation or otherwise for
purposes of the Ohio personal income tax, Ohio school district income
taxes, the Ohio corporation franchise tax, or the Ohio dealers in
intangibles tax.


Income of an Ohio Insured Trust will be treated as the income of the
Unit holders for purposes of the Ohio personal income tax, Ohio school
district income taxes, Ohio municipal income taxes and the Ohio
corporation franchise tax in proportion to the respective interest
therein of each Unit holder.


Interest on Ohio Obligations and Territorial Obligations held by an Ohio
Insured Trust is exempt from the Ohio personal income tax, Ohio
municipal income taxes and Ohio school district income taxes and is
excluded from the net income base of the Ohio corporation franchise tax
when distributed or deemed distributed to Unit holders.


Proceeds paid under insurance policies, if any, to the Trustee of an
Ohio Insured Trust, representing maturing interest on defaulted
obligations held by an Ohio Insured Trust will be exempt from the Ohio
personal income tax, Ohio school district income taxes, Ohio municipal
income taxes and the net income base of the Ohio corporation franchise
tax if, and to the same extent as, such interest would be exempt from
such taxes if paid directly by the issuer of such obligations.


Gains and losses realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition by
an Ohio Insured Trust of Ohio Obligations are excluded in determining
adjusted gross and taxable income for purposes of the Ohio personal
income tax, Ohio municipal income taxes and Ohio school district income
taxes and are excluded from the net income base of the Ohio corporation
franchise tax when distributed or deemed distributed to Unit holders.


For information with respect to the Federal income tax status and other
tax matters, see "What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?"



Certain Considerations



As described above, an Ohio Insured Trust will invest most of its net
assets in securities issued by or on behalf of (or in certificates of
participation in lease-purchase obligations of) the State of Ohio,
political subdivisions of the State, or agencies or instrumentalities of
the State or its political subdivisions (Ohio Obligations). An Ohio
Insured Trust is therefore susceptible to general or particular
political, economic or regulatory factors that may affect issuers of
Ohio Obligations. The following information constitutes only a brief
summary of some of the many complex factors that may have an effect. The
information does not apply to "conduit" obligations on which the public
issuer itself has no financial responsibility. This information is
derived from official statements of certain Ohio issuers published in
connection with their issuance of securities and from other publicly


Page 5


available information, and is believed to be accurate. No independent
verification has been made of any of the following information.


Generally, the creditworthiness of Ohio Obligations of local issuers is
unrelated to that of obligations of the State itself, and the State has
no responsibility to make payments on those local obligations.


There may be specific factors that at particular times apply in
connection with investment in particular Ohio Obligations or in those
obligations of particular Ohio issuers. It is possible that the
investment may be in particular Ohio Obligations, or in those of
particular issuers, as to which those factors apply. However, the
information below is intended only as a general summary, and is not
intended as a discussion of any specific factors that may affect any
particular obligation or issuer.


The timely payment of principal of and interest on Ohio Obligations has
been guaranteed by bond insurance purchased by the issuers, the Ohio
Trusts or other parties. Those Ohio Obligations may not be subject to
the factors referred to in this section of the Prospectus.


Ohio is the seventh most populous state; the 1990 Census count of
10,847,000 indicated a 0.5% population increase from 1980. The Census
estimate for 1996 is 11,173,000.


While diversifying more into the service and other non-manufacturing
areas, the Ohio economy continues to rely in part on durable goods
manufacturing largely concentrated in motor vehicles and equipment,
steel, rubber products and household appliances. As a result, general
economic activity, as in many other industrially-developed states, tends
to be more cyclical than in some other states and in the nation as a
whole. Agriculture is an important segment of the economy, with over
half the State's area devoted to farming and approximately 16% of total
employment in agribusiness.


In prior years, the State's overall unemployment rate was commonly
somewhat higher than the national figure. For example, the reported 1990
average monthly State rate was 5.7%, compared to the 5.5% national
figure. However, for the last six years, the State rates were below the
national rates (4.9% versus 5.4% in 1996). The unemployment rate and its
effects vary among geographic areas of the State.


There can be no assurance that future national, regional or state-wide
economic difficulties, and the resulting impact on State or local
government finances generally, will not adversely affect the market
value of Ohio Obligations held in the Ohio Trusts or the ability of
particular obligors to make timely payments of debt service on (or lease
payments relating to) those Obligations.


The State operates on the basis of a fiscal biennium for its
appropriations and expenditures, and is precluded by law from ending its
July 1 to June 30 fiscal year (FY) or fiscal biennium in a deficit
position. Most State operations are financed through the General Revenue
Fund (GRF), for which the personal income and sales-use taxes are the
major sources. Growth and depletion of GRF ending fund balances show a
consistent pattern related to national economic conditions, with the
ending FY balance reduced during less favorable and increased during
more favorable economic periods. The State has well-established
procedures for, and has timely taken, necessary actions to ensure
resource/expenditure balances during less favorable economic periods.
Those procedures included general and selected reductions in
appropriations spending.


The 1992-93 biennium presented significant challenges to State finances,
which were successfully addressed. To allow time to resolve certain
budget differences, an interim appropriations act was enacted effective
July 1, 1991; it included GRF debt service and lease rental
appropriations for the entire biennium, while continuing most other
appropriations for a month. Pursuant to the general appropriations act
for the entire biennium, passed on July 11, 1991, $200 million was
transferred from the Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF, a cash and
budgetary management fund) to the GRF in FY 1992.


Based on updated results and forecasts in the course of that fiscal
year, both in light of a continuing uncertain nationwide economic
situation, there was projected, and then timely addressed, an FY 1992
imbalance in GRF resources and expenditures. In response, the Governor
ordered most State agencies to reduce GRF spending in the last six
months of FY 1992 by a total of approximately $184 million; the $100.4
million BSF balance and additional amounts from certain other funds were
transferred late in the FY to the GRF, and adjustments were made in the
timing of certain tax payments.


A significant GRF shortfall (approximately $520 million) was then
projected for FY 1993. It was addressed by appropriate legislative and
administrative actions, including the Governor's ordering $300 million
in selected GRF spending reductions and subsequent executive and
legislative action (a combination of tax revisions and additional


Page 6


spending reductions). The June 30, 1993 ending GRF fund balance was
approximately $111 million, of which, as a first step to replenishment,
$21 million was deposited in the BSF.


None of the spending reductions were applied to appropriations needed
for debt service or lease rentals relating to any State obligations.


The 1994-95 biennium presented a more affirmative financial picture.
Based on June 30, 1994 balances, an additional $260 million was
deposited in the BSF. The biennium ended June 30, 1995 with a GRF ending
fund balance of $928 million, of which $535.2 million was transferred
into the BSF. The significant GRF fund balance, after leaving in the GRF
an unreserved and undesignated balance of $70 million, was transferred
to the BSF and other funds including school assistance funds and, in
anticipation of possible federal program changes, a human services
stabilization fund.


From a higher than forecast 1996-97 mid-biennium GRF fund balance, $100
million was transferred for elementary and secondary school computer
network purposes and $30 million to a new State transportation
infrastructure fund. Approximately $400.8 million served as a basis for
temporary 1996 personal income tax reductions aggregating that amount.
The 1996-97 biennium-ending GRF fund balance was $834.9 million. Of
that, $250 million goes to school building construction and renovation,
$94 million to the school computer network, $44.2 million for school
textbooks and instructional materials and a distance learning program,
and $34 million to the BSF (which had a January 8, 1998 balance of
$862.7 million), with the $263 million balance to a State income tax
reduction fund.


The GRF appropriations act for the 1997-98 biennium was passed on June
25, 1997 and promptly signed (after selective vetoes) by the Governor.
All necessary GRF appropriations for State debt service and lease rental
payments then projected for the biennium were included in that act.


The State's incurrence or assumption of debt without a vote of the
people is, with limited exceptions, prohibited by current State
constitutional provisions. The State may incur debt, limited in amount
to $750,000, to cover casual deficits or failures in revenues or to meet
expenses not otherwise provided for. The Constitution expressly
precludes the State from assuming the debts of any local government or
corporation. (An exception is made in both cases for any debt incurred
to repel invasion, suppress insurrection or defend the State in war.)


By 14 constitutional amendments, approved from 1921 to date (the last
adopted in 1995), Ohio voters have authorized the incurrence of State
debt and the pledge of taxes or excises to its payment. At January 8,
1998, $1.07 billion (excluding certain highway bonds payable primarily
from highway use receipts) of this debt was outstanding or sold and
awaiting delivery. The only such State debt at that date still
authorized to be incurred were portions of the highway bonds and the
following: (a) up to $100 million of obligations for coal research and
development may be outstanding at any one time ($30.9 million
outstanding); (b) of a total $2.4 billion which may be issued, $240
million of obligations previously authorized for local government
infrastructure improvements, no more than $120 million of which may be
issued in any calendar year ($946.9 million outstanding or sold and
awaiting delivery); and (c) up to $200 million in general obligation
bonds for parks, recreation and natural resources purposes which may be
outstanding at any one time ($90.9 million outstanding with no more than
$50 million to be issued in any one year).


The electors approved in November 1995 a constitutional amendment that
extends the local infrastructure bond program (authorizing an additional
$1.2 billion of State full faith and credit obligations to be issued
over 10 years for that purpose), and authorizes additional highway bonds
(expected to be payable primarily from highway use receipts). The latter
supersedes the prior $500 million outstanding authorization, and
authorizes not more that $1.2 billion to be outstanding at any time and
not more than $220 million to be issued in a fiscal year.


The Constitution also authorizes the issuance of State obligations for
certain purposes, the owners of which do not have the right to have
excises or taxes levied to pay debt service. Those special obligations
include obligations issued by the Ohio Public Facilities Commission and
the Ohio Building Authority, and certain obligations issued by the State
Treasurer, over $4.8 billion of which were outstanding at January 8, 1998.


A 1990 constitutional amendment authorizes greater State and political
subdivision participation (including financing) in the provision of
housing. The General Assembly may for that purpose authorize the
issuance of State obligations secured by a pledge of all or such portion
as it authorizes of State revenues or receipts (but not by a pledge of
the State's full faith and credit).


Page 7


A 1994 constitutional amendment pledges the full faith and credit and
taxing power of the State to meeting certain guarantees under the
State's tuition credit program which provides for purchase of tuition
credits, for the benefit of State residents, guaranteed to cover a
specified amount when applied to the cost of higher education tuition.
(A 1965 constitutional provision that authorized student loan guarantees
payable from available State moneys has never been implemented, apart
from a "guarantee fund" approach funded essentially from program
revenues).


State and local agencies issue obligations that are payable from
revenues from or relating to certain facilities (but not from taxes). By
judicial interpretation, these obligations are not "debt" within
constitutional provisions. In general, payment obligations under lease-
purchase agreements of Ohio public agencies (in which certificates of
participation may be issued) are limited in duration to the agency's
fiscal period, and are renewable only upon appropriations being made
available for the subsequent fiscal period.


Local school districts in Ohio receive a major portion (state-wide
aggregate approximately 44% in recent years) of their operating moneys
from State subsidies, but are dependent on local property taxes, and in
119 districts from voter-authorized income taxes, for significant
portions of their budgets. Litigation, similar to that in other states,
has been pending questioning the constitutionality of Ohio's system of
school funding. The Ohio Supreme Court has concluded that aspects of the
system (including basic operating assistance and the loan program
referred to below) are unconstitutional, and ordered the State to
provide for and fund a system complying with the Ohio Constitution,
staying its order for a year (to March 1998) to permit time for
responsive corrective actions. A small number of the State's 612 local
school districts have in any year required special assistance to avoid
year-end deficits. A program has provided for school district cash need
borrowing directly from commercial lenders, with diversion of State
subsidy distributions to repayment if needed. Recent borrowings under
this program totalled $41.1 million for 28 districts in FY 1994, $71.1
million for 29 districts in FY 1995 (including $29.5 million for one
district), $87.2 million for 20 districts in FY 1996 (including $42.1
million for one district) and $113.2 million for 12 districts in 1997
(including $90 million to one for restructuring its prior loans).


Ohio's 943 incorporated cities and villages rely primarily on property
and municipal income taxes for their operations. With other
subdivisions, they also receive local government support and property
tax relief moneys distributed by the State. For those few municipalities
and school districts that on occasion have faced significant financial
problems, there are statutory procedures for a joint State/local
commission to monitor the fiscal affairs and for development of a
financial plan to eliminate deficits and cure any defaults. (Similar
procedures have recently been extended to counties and townships.) Since
inception for municipalities in 1979, these "fiscal emergency"
procedures have been applied to 24 cities and villages; for 18 of them
the fiscal situation was resolved and the procedures terminated (one
village is in preliminary "fiscal watch" status). As of January 27,
1998, the 1996 school district "fiscal emergency" provision has been
applied to five districts and 12 districts were placed on preliminary
"fiscal watch" status.


At present the State itself does not levy ad valorem taxes on real or
tangible personal property. Those taxes are levied by political
subdivisions and other local taxing districts. The Constitution has
since 1934 limited to 1% of true value in money the amount of the
aggregate levy (including a levy for unvoted general obligations) of
property taxes by all overlapping subdivisions, without a vote of the
electors or a municipal charter provision, and statutes limit the amount
of that aggregate levy to 10 mills per $1 of assessed valuation
(commonly referred to as the "ten-mill limitation"). Voted general
obligations of subdivisions are payable from property taxes that are
unlimited as to amount or rate.


The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of
the general factors which may impact certain issuers of Bonds and does
not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse
conditions to which the issuers of Bonds held by the Ohio Trusts are
subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social
and environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the
control of the issuers of the Bonds, could affect or could have an
adverse impact on the financial condition of the issuers. The Sponsor is
unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other
factors may affect the issuers of the Bonds, the market value or
marketability of the Bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of
the Bonds acquired by the Ohio Trusts to pay interest on or principal of
the Bonds.

Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders



At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from
Federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective
issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to State Trusts, where
applicable, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as
to the exemption of interest on such Bonds when held by residents of the
State in which the issuers of such Bonds are located, from State income
taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes.
Neither the Sponsor, Chapman and Cutler, nor any of the Special Counsel
to the Fund for State tax matters have made any special review for the
Fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the
bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith. If the interest
on a Bond should be determined to be taxable, the Bond would generally
have to be sold at a substantial discount. In addition, investors could
be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on
which interest is determined to be taxable.


Gain realized on the sale or redemption of the Bonds by the Trustee or
of a Unit by a Unit holder is includable in gross income for Federal
income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax
purposes. (Such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of
accrued interest or accrued original issue discount, if any.) If a Bond
is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price paid for
the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond. When this
accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of capital and
reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased for a premium,
the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the Bond. Bond
premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond, and the tax
basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium
amortized in that tax year.


For purposes of the following opinions, it is assumed that each asset of
the Trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income
for Federal income tax purposes. At the time of the closing for each
Trust, Chapman and Cutler, Counsel for the Sponsor, rendered an opinion
under then existing law substantially to the effect that:


(1)   the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for
Federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue
discount on Bonds which is excludable from gross income under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") will retain its status for
Federal income tax purposes, when received by the Trusts and distributed
to a Unit holder; however, such interest may be taken into account in
computing the alternative minimum tax and the additional tax on branches
of foreign corporations and the environmental tax (the "Superfund Tax"),
as noted below. See "Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit
Holders";



ALL PARTS OF THE PROSPECTUS SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR





FUTURE REFERENCE.



THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY
OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.


Page 1


(2)   each Unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata
portion of each asset of the respective Trust under subpart E,
subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code and will have a taxable event when
the Trust disposes of a Bond, or when the Unit holder redeems or sells
his Units. If the Unit holder disposes of a Unit, he is deemed thereby
to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the
Trust involved including his pro rata portion of all the Bonds
represented by the Unit. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (the "1997
Act") includes provisions that treat certain transactions designed to
reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain (e.g. short
sales, offsetting notional principal contracts, futures or forward
contracts or similar transactions) as constructive sales for purposes of
recognition of gain (but not loss) and for purposes of determining the
holding period. Unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with
regard to any such constructive sale rules. Unit holders must reduce the
tax basis of their Units for their share of accrued interest received by
the respective Trust, if any, on Bonds before the date the Trust
acquired ownership of the Bonds (and the amount of this reduction may
exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller) and,
consequently, such Unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or
reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such Units. Gain or
loss upon the sale or redemption of Units is measured by comparing the
proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the
Units. If the Trustee disposes of Bonds (whether by sale, payment on
maturity, redemption or otherwise), gain or loss is recognized to the
Unit holder (subject to various non-recognition provisions of the Code).
The amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the Unit
holder's pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with
the Unit holder's basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset
disposed of. In the case of a Unit holder who purchases Units, such
basis (before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and
amortized bond premium, if any) is determined by apportioning the cost
of the Units among each of the Trust assets ratably according to value
as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the Units.
Unit holders should consult their own tax advisers with regard to the
calculation of basis. The tax basis reduction requirements of the Code
relating to amortization of bond premium may, under some circumstances,
result in the Unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his Units are
sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost;
and


(3)  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by
issuers of Bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds
held by the Trustee will be excludable from Federal gross income if, and
to the same extent as, such interest would have been so excludable if
paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted Bonds provided
that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such
policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable
expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer, will
pay debt service on the Bonds.


Sections 1288 and 1272 of the Code provide a complex set of rules
governing the accrual of original issue discount. These rules provide
that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant
compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the Bond, depending
on the date the Bond was issued. In addition, special rules apply if the
purchase price of a Bond exceeds the original issue price plus the
amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued
based upon its issue price (its "adjusted issue price") to prior owners.
If a Bond is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price
paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond.
When this accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of
capital and reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased
for a premium, the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of
the Bond. Bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond,
and the tax basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of
the premium amortized in that tax year. The application of these rules
will also vary depending on the value of the Bond on the date a Unit
holder acquires his Unit, and the price the Unit holder pays for his
Unit. Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these
rules and their application. See "Portfolio" appearing in Part One for
each Trust for information relating to Bonds, if any, issued at an
original issue discount.


The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the "Tax Act") subjects tax-
exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the Code effective for
bonds purchased after April 30, 1993. In general, market discount is the
amount (if any) by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds
an investor's purchase price (except to the extent that such difference,


Page 2


if any, is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued),
subject to statutory de minimis rule. Market discount can arise based on
the price a Trust pays for Bonds or the price a Unit holder pays for his
or her Units. Under the Tax Act, accretion of market discount is taxable
as ordinary income; under prior law the accretion had been treated as
capital gain. Market discount that accretes while a Trust holds a Bond
would be recognized as ordinary income by the Unit holders when
principal payments are received on the Bond, upon sale or at redemption
(including early redemption) or upon the sale or redemption of his or
her Units, unless a Unit holder elects to include market discount in
taxable income as it accrues. The market discount rules are complex and
Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and
their application.


Counsel for the Sponsor has also advised that under Section 265 of the
Code, interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or
carry Units of a Trust is not deductible for Federal income tax
purposes. The Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that such
indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying
of Units (however, these rules generally do not apply to interest paid
on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence).
Also, under Section 265 of the Code, certain financial institutions that
acquire Units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest
expense attributable to ownership of Units. Legislative proposals have
been made that would extend the financial institution rules to certain
other corporations including securities dealers and other financial
intermediaries. Investors with questions regarding these issues should
consult with their tax advisers.


In the case of certain of the Bonds in a Trust, the opinions of bond
counsel indicate that interest on such Bonds received by a "substantial
user" of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these Bonds,
or persons related thereto, for periods while such Bonds are held by
such a user or related person, will not be excludable from Federal gross
income, although interest on such Bonds received by others would be
excludable from Federal gross income. "Substantial user" and "related
person" are defined under the Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations. Any
person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related
person as so defined should contact his tax adviser.


ALL STATEMENTS OF LAW IN THE PROSPECTUS CONCERNING EXCLUSION FROM GROSS
INCOME FOR FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER TAX PURPOSES ARE THE OPINIONS OF
COUNSEL AND ARE TO BE SO CONSTRUED.


At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from
Federal gross income are rendered by bond counsel to the respective
issuing authorities. Neither the Sponsor nor Chapman and Cutler has made
any special review for the Fund of the proceedings relating to the
issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for such opinions.


In general, Section 86 of the Code provides that 50% of Social Security
benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of
"modified adjusted gross income" plus 50% of the Social Security
benefits received exceeds the "base amount." The base amount is $25,000
for unmarried taxpayers, $32,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint
return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times
during the taxable year and who file separate returns. Modified adjusted
gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to
certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income
and by including tax-exempt interest. To the extent that Social Security
benefits are includible in gross income, they will be treated as any
other item of gross income.


In addition, under the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after
December 31 1993, up to 85% of Social Security benefits are includible
in gross income to the extent that the sum of "modified adjusted gross
income" plus 50% of Social Security benefits received exceeds an
"adjusted base amount." The adjusted base amount is $34,000 for
unmarried taxpayers, $44,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint
return, and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all
times during the taxable year and who file separate returns.


Although tax-exempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross
income solely for the purpose of determining what portion, if any, of
Social Security benefits will be included in gross income, no tax-exempt
interest, including that received from a Trust, will be subject to tax.
A taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount
or the adjusted base amount must include 50% or 85%, respectively, of
his Social Security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives
any tax-exempt interest. A taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income
(after inclusion of tax-exempt interest) does not exceed the base amount
need not include any Social Security benefits in gross income.

For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals
and corporations, interest on certain private activity bonds (which
includes most industrial and housing revenue bonds) issued on or after
August 8, 1986 is included as an item of tax preference. EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE NOTED IN PART ONE FOR CERTAIN TRUSTS, THE TRUSTS DO NOT
INCLUDE ANY SUCH PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS ISSUED ON OR AFTER THAT DATE.


For taxpayers other than corporations, net capital gains (which is
defined as net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss
for the taxable year) are subject to a maximum marginal stated tax rate
of either 28% or 20%, depending upon the holding period of the capital
assets. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the holding period for the
asset is more than one year, and is short-term if the holding period for
the asset is one year or less. Generally, capital gain realized from
assets held for more than one year but not more than 18 months are taxed
at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 28% and capital gains realized
from assets (with certain exclusions) held for more than 18 months are
taxed at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 20% (10% in the case of
certain taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket). Further, capital gains
realized from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same
rate as ordinary income. Legislation is currently pending that provides
the appropriate methodology that should be applied in netting the
realized capital gains and losses. Such legislation is proposed to be
effective retroactively for tax years ending after May 6, 1997. The date
on which a Unit is acquired (i.e., the "trade date") is excluded for
purposes of determining the holding period of the Unit. It should be
noted that legislative proposals are introduced from time to time that
affect tax rates and could affect relative differences at which ordinary
income and capital gains are taxed.


In addition, please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as
ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are
considered "conversion transactions" effective for transactions entered
into after April 30, 1993. Unit holders and prospective investors should
consult with their tax advisers regarding the potential effect of this
provision on their investment in Units.


Under the Code, taxpayers must disclose to the Internal Revenue Service
the amount of tax-exempt interest earned during the year.


Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit Holders. In the case of
certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax and the Superfund Tax
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986 depend upon the
corporation's alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is the
corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the
adjustment items used in computing AMTI of a corporation (other than an
S Corporation, Regulated Investment Company, Real Estate Investment
Trust, or REMIC) is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such
corporation's "adjusted current earnings" over an amount equal to its
AMTI (before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating
loss deduction). "Adjusted current earnings" includes all tax-exempt
interest, including interest on all of the Bonds in the Trusts. Under
current Code provisions, the Superfund Tax does not apply to tax years
beginning on or after January 1, 1996. Legislative proposals have been
introduced that would reinstate the Superfund Tax for taxable years
beginning after December 31, 1997 and before January 1, 2009. Under the
provisions of Section 884 of the Code, a branch profits tax is levied on
the "effectively connected earnings and profits" of certain foreign
corporations which include tax-exempt interest such as interest on the
Bonds in the Trust. Unit holders should consult their tax advisers with
respect to the particular tax consequences to them, including the
corporate alternative minimum tax, the Superfund Tax and the branch
profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the Code.


Ownership of the Units may result in collateral federal income tax
consequences to certain taxpayers, including, without limitation,
corporations, subject to the branch profits tax, financial institutions,
certain insurance companies, certain S corporations, individual
recipients of Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and
taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred (or continued) indebtedness
to purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisers as to the applicability of any such
collateral consequences.


At the time of the closing, Winston & Strawn (previously named Cole &
Deitz), Special Counsel to Series 4-125 of the Fund for New York tax
matters, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax laws of the
State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that each Trust
in Series 4-125 of the Fund is not an association taxable as a
corporation and the income of each Trust in Series 4-125 of the Fund


Page 4


will be treated as the income of the Unit holder in the same manner as
for Federal income tax purposes (subject to differences in accounting
for discount and premium to the extent the State and/or City of New York
do not conform to current Federal law).


At the time of the closing, Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, Special Counsel
to the Fund for New York tax matters for Series 126 and subsequent
Series of the Fund, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax
laws of the State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that
each Trust will not constitute an association taxable as a corporation
under New York law, and accordingly will not be subject to the New York
State franchise tax or the New York City general corporation tax. Under
the income tax laws of the State and City of New York, the income of
each Trust will be considered the income of the holders of the Units.


All statements in the Prospectus concerning exclusion from gross income
for Federal, state or other are the opinions of Counsel and are to be so
construed.



Pennsylvania Tax Status of Unit Holders



In rendering its opinion, Special Counsel has not, for timing reasons,
made an independent review of proceedings related to the issuance of the
Bonds. It has relied on the Sponsor for assurance that the Bonds have
been issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or by or on behalf of
municipalities or other governmental agencies within the Commonwealth.


At the time of the closing for each Pennsylvania Trust, Special Counsel
to the Fund for Pennsylvania tax matters rendered an opinion under then
existing Pennsylvania income tax law applicable to taxpayers whose
income is subject to Pennsylvania income taxation substantially to the
effect that:


Units evidencing fractional undivided interests in a Pennsylvania Trust,
which are represented by obligations issued by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, any public authority, commission, board or other agency
created by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, any political subdivision
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any public authority created by
any such political subdivision, are not taxable under any of the
personal property taxes presently in effect in Pennsylvania;


Distributions of interest income to Unit holders that would not be
taxable if received directly by a Pennsylvania resident are not subject
to personal income tax under the Pennsylvania Tax Reform Code of 1971;
nor will such interest be taxable under the Philadelphia School District
Investment Income Tax imposed on Philadelphia resident individuals;


A Unit holder will have a taxable event under the Pennsylvania state and
local income taxes referred to in the preceding paragraph upon the
redemption or sale of his Units. Units will be taxable under the
Pennsylvania inheritance and estate taxes;


A Unit holder which is a corporation will have a taxable event under the
Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax when it redeems or sells its
Units. Interest income distributed to Unit holders which are
corporations is not subject to Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax or
Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax. However, banks, title insurance
companies and trust companies may be required to take the value of the
Units into account in determining the taxable value of their shares
subject to the Shares tax;


Under Act No. 68 of December 3, 1993, gains derived by a Pennsylvania
Trust from the sale, exchange or other disposition of Bonds may be
subject to Pennsylvania personal or corporate income taxes. Those gains
which are distributed by a Pennsylvania Trust to Unit holders who are
individuals may be subject to Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax. For Unit
holders which are corporations, the distributed gains may be subject to
Corporate Net Income Tax or Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax. Gains which
are not distributed by a Pennsylvania Trust may nevertheless be taxable
to Unit holders if derived by a Pennsylvania Trust from the sale,
exchange or other disposition of Bonds issued on or after February 1,
1994. Gains which are not distributed by a Pennsylvania Trust will
remain nontaxable to Unit holders if derived by a Pennsylvania Trust
from the sale, exchange or other disposition of Bonds issued prior to
February 1, 1994.


Any proceeds paid under insurance policies issued to the Trustee or
obtained by issuers of the Bonds with respect to the Bonds which
represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee
will be excludable from Pennsylvania gross income if, and to the same
extent as, such interest would have been so excludable if paid by the
issuer of the defaulted obligations;


A Pennsylvania Trust is not taxable as a corporation under Pennsylvania
tax laws applicable to corporations.


Page 5


On December 3, 1993, changes to Pennsylvania laws affecting taxation of
income and gains from the sale of Pennsylvania and local obligations
were enacted. Among these changes was the repeal of the exemption from
tax of gains realized upon the sale or other disposition of such
obligations. The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue has issued proposed
regulations concerning these changes. The opinions expressed above are
based on Special Counsel's analysis of the law and proposed regulations,
but are subject to modification upon review of final regulations or
other guidance that may be issued by the Department of Revenue or future
court decisions.

tax matters, see "What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?"



Certain Considerations



Investors should be aware of certain factors that might affect the
financial conditions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
historically has been identified as a heavy industry state although that
reputation has changed recently as the industrial composition of the
Commonwealth diversified when the coal, steel and railroad industries
began to decline. A more diversified economy was necessary as the
traditionally strong industries in the Commonwealth declined due to a
long-term shift in jobs, investment and workers away from the northeast
part of the nation. The major sources of growth in Pennsylvania are in
the service sector, including trade, medical and the health services,
education and financial institutions. Pennsylvania's agricultural
industries are also an important component of the Commonwealth's
economic structure, particularly in crop and livestock products as well
as agribusiness and food related industries.


Strong growth experienced in Pennsylvania in 1997 was unanticipated and
is unlikely to continue. The peak growth was reached during the first
quarter and growth in subsequent quarters has been lower. Due to
Pennsylvania's improved competitive position, the Commonwealth should
experience economic growth rates close to the national average. The
annual rate of job growth, ranked 45th in 1995, is currently ranked 17th
nationwide.


Non-manufacturing employment has increased in recent years to 82.9% of
total Commonwealth employment as of December 1997. Consequently,
manufacturing employment constitutes a diminished share of total
employment within the Commonwealth. Manufacturing, contributing 17.1% of
non-agricultural employment as of December 1997, has fallen behind both
the services sector and the trade sector as the largest single source of
employment within the Commonwealth. In December 1997, the services
sector accounted for 31.6% of all non-agricultural employment while the
trade sector accounted for 22.8%.


Preliminary results from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and
Industry show Pennsylvania's total non-farm jobs increased by 106,200 or
almost 2% from December 1996 to December 1997. The services industry was
responsible for over one-half of all new jobs created during this
period. Retail trade increased 1.5% or 14,000 jobs. Construction
employment increased 7.4% or 15,200 jobs. Manufacturing growth was slow
at .4% or 4,100 jobs from December 1996 to December 1997. As of December
1997, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the Commonwealth was
4.8% compared to 4.7% for the United States.


More jobs in 1997 brought faster growing personal income. For the four
quarters ending with the first quarter of 1997, personal income in
Pennsylvania rose at a rate of over 6%. This healthy advance contributed
to a 6.1% increase in General Fund tax revenue for fiscal year 1996-97
due to similar increases in collections for personal income tax and the
sales and use tax.


Financial information for the principal operating funds of the
Commonwealth is maintained on a budgetary basis of accounting. A
budgetary basis of accounting is used for the purpose of ensuring
compliance with the enacted operating budget and is governed by
applicable statutes of the Commonwealth and by administrative
procedures. The Commonwealth also prepares annual financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
The budgetary basis financial information maintained by the Commonwealth
to monitor and enforce budgetary control is adjusted at fiscal year-end
to reflect appropriate accruals for financial reporting in conformity
with GAAP.


Fiscal 1997 Financial Results. At June 30, 1997, the Commonwealth
reported an unreserved/undesignated fund balance (budgetary basis) of
$402.7 million in the General Fund. This compares to a budgetary basis
fund balance of $158.5 million at June 30, 1996. The budgetary basis
fund balance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 was the result of
revenue collections totaling $26,149.6 million less appropriation


Page 6


authorizations totaling $25,835.7 million, less other net financing uses
totaling $69.7 million. Included in the $25,835.7 million appropriation
authorizations are $164.3 million of state supplemental appropriations
and $207.0 million in federal supplemental appropriations authorized
during the fiscal year.


On a GAAP basis, at June 30, 1997, the Commonwealth's General Fund
reported a fund balance of $1,364.9 million, an increase of $729.7
million from the $635.2 million fund balance at June 30, 1996. Total
assets increased by $563.4 million to $4,268.5 million. Liabilities
decreased $166.3 million to $2,903.6 million.


For fiscal year 1996-97, revenues of the Commonwealth's General, Special
Revenue, Debt Service and Capital Projects Funds (collectively, the
governmental funds) totaled $32,073 million, an increase of $1,147
million or 3.7% from fiscal year 1995-96. Taxes accounted for 56.6% of
the total general governmental revenues. Their combined fund balances at
June 30, 1997 increased by $914.6 million to $2,900.9 million. The
unreserved/undesignated fund balance was $699.2 million compared to
$378.2 million from the previous year.


Fiscal 1998 Budget. Total receipts for fiscal year 1997-98 are projected
at $17,077 million. Appropriations are estimated at $17,269 million. The
closing balance in the General Fund (after adding the beginning balance
of $403 billion and deducting lapses of $120 million) is $331 million.
After a transfer to the Rainy Day Fund of $50 million, the ending
balance in the General Fund for fiscal year 1997-98 is estimated at $281
million.


Estimated revenues for 1997-98 have been raised $231.1 million due to
substantial upward revisions to personal income and inheritance revenues
and downward revisions to sales and use and insurance premiums taxes.
The personal income tax has provided almost all of the revenue surplus.
Through December 1997, fiscal year 1997-98 revenues have increased 2.8%
over the same period in the prior fiscal year. Revised estimates for
1997-98 project a 2.1% increase in General Fund revenues. Total
revenues, excluding proposed tax changes, are projected to increase by
2.9%.


Proposed Fiscal 1999 Budget. The Governor's 1998-99 Budget continues a
four-year record of tax cuts and fiscal discipline. The proposed 1998-99
General Fund Budget is $17.8 billion, an increase of $518 million or 3%.
The total recommended budget for 1998-99 is $35.8 billion. Approximately
$10.16 billion is from federal funds.


General Fund revenue is estimated to be generated in the following
percentages: 34.7% from sales tax, 34.2% from personal income tax, 12.5%
from business tax, 9.3% from corporate net income tax, 5.4% from other
revenues, and 3.9% from the inheritance tax. Total expenditures for
fiscal year 1998-99 are estimated in the following percentages: 44.3%
for education, 34.4% for health and human services, 11.3% for
protection, 3.8% for direction programs, 3.1% for other programs, and
3.1% for economic development.


Budgets for the past four years have proposed an average spending growth
of 2.0%. The average growth in the enacted budgets during the previous
ten-year period was 5.4%. Over $128 million in tax reductions are
proposed in 1998-99 to help working families and to stimulate job
creation and retention.


After an estimated $2 million transfer to the Rainy Day Fund in 1998-99,
the ending fund balance for the General Fund for fiscal year 1998-99 is
estimated at $9 million. With the projected transfer at the end of 1998-
99, the reserve balance in the Commonwealth's Rainy Day Fund will exceed
$500 million, more than seven times the balance in 1994-95.


Debt Administration. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania permits the incurrence of debt, without approval of the
electorate, for capital projects specifically authorized in a capital
budget. Capital project debt outstanding cannot exceed one and three
quarters (1.75) times the average of the annual tax revenues deposited
in all funds during the previous five fiscal years. The certified
constitutional debt limit at August 29, 1997 was $34.3 billion.
Outstanding capital project debt at August 29, 1997 amounted to $3.7
billion.


In addition to constitutionally authorized capital project debt, the
Commonwealth may incur debt for electorate approved programs, such as
economic revitalization, land and water development, and water
facilities restoration; and for special purposes approved by the General
Assembly, such as disaster relief. The total general obligation bond
indebtedness outstanding at June 30, 1997 was $4,842 million. Total debt
service transfers paid from General Fund and Motor License Fund
appropriations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 amounted to
$781.5 million.


Page 7


All outstanding general obligation bonds of the Commonwealth are rated
AA- by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's. Any explanation concerning the
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies.
There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.


In addition to general obligation bonds, the Commonwealth issues tax
anticipation notes ("TANS") to meet operating cash needs during certain
months of the fiscal year. The Commonwealth anticipates issuance of $225
million in General Fund TANS during the 1997-98 fiscal year. During
fiscal year 1996-97, $550 million TANS were issued.


The City of Philadelphia ("Philadelphia") is the largest city in the
Commonwealth, with an estimated population of 1,478,002 in 1996,
according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Philadelphia functions both
as a city of the first class and a county for the purpose of
administering various governmental programs.


Legislation providing for the establishment of the Pennsylvania
Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority ("PICA") to assist first class
cities in remedying fiscal emergencies was enacted by the General
Assembly and approved by the Governor in June 1991. PICA is designed to
provide assistance through the issuance of funding debt to liquidate
budget deficits and to make factual findings and recommendations to the
assisted city concerning its budgetary and fiscal affairs. An
intergovernmental cooperation agreement between Philadelphia and PICA
was approved by City Council on January 3, 1992, and approved by the
PICA Board and signed by the Mayor on January 8, 1992. At this time,
Philadelphia is operating under a five-year fiscal plan approved by PICA
on April 30, 1996.


As of February 28, 1997, PICA has issued approximately $1,761.7 million
of its Special Tax Revenue Bonds to provide financial assistance to
Philadelphia, to liquidate the cumulative General Fund balance deficit,
to refund certain general obligation bonds of the City and to fund
additional capital projects. No further PICA bonds are to be issued by
PICA for the purpose of financing a capital project or deficit as the
authority for such bond sales expired on December 31, 1994. PICA's
authority to issue debt for the purpose of financing a cash flow deficit
expired on December 31, 1996. Its ability to refund existing outstanding
debt is unrestricted. PICA had $1,102.4 million in Special Tax Revenue
Bonds outstanding as of June 30, 1997.


The audited General fund balance of the City as of June 30, 1995, 1996,
and 1997 showed a surplus of approximately $80.5 million, $118.5
million, and $128.8 million, respectively.


S&P's rating on Philadelphia's general obligation bonds is "BBB" and
Moody's rating is "Baa." Any explanation concerning the significance of
such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no
assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that
they will not be revised or withdrawn.


It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations issued by
local Pennsylvania issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and there is no
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local
obligations in the event of default.


The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of
the general factors which may impact certain issuers of Bonds and does
not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse
conditions to which the issuers of Bonds held by the Pennsylvania Trusts
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic,
social and environmental policies and conditions, which are not within
the control of the issuers of the Bonds, could affect or could have an
adverse impact on the financial condition of the issuers. The Sponsor is
unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other
factors may affect the issuers of the Bonds, the market value or
marketability of the Bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of
the Bonds acquired by the Pennsylvania Trusts to pay interest on or
principal of the Bonds.
