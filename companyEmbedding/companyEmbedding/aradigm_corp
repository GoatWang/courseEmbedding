Inhalation Drug Treatments to Prevent and Treat Severe
    Respiratory Diseases
Inhalation
    drug delivery is the preferred method of treatment for many respiratory
    diseases and it is gaining acceptance as a route of delivery for the
    treatment of systemic diseases. Currently, Aradigm has respiratory inhalation
    products in preclinical and clinical development for the treatment of
    cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis*, biodefense and tobacco smoking cessation.
    These products are designed to improve patients' quality of life and
    overall treatment outcomes by enabling them to safely and painlessly
    self-administer aerosolized liquid medications directly to and through the
    lungs. All of these products utilize the Company's proprietary drug
    delivery technologies.
Below is
    a list of proprietary programs and their respective stages of development.
    In addition to these current programs, Aradigm continues to apply its
    expertise and intellectual property to other potential therapeutic
    applications that may benefit from the Company's novel formulations and
    drug delivery technology.

About Aradigm 




About
    Aradigm
Business Overview
Leadership


Aradigm is actively engaged in
    fulfilling the promise of developing inhalation drug products that could
    revolutionize the quality of life of patients with severe pulmonary
    disease. 
Since
    1991, the company has attracted an outstanding team of scientists, engineers
    and clinical experts who have been at the forefront of development of
    advanced inhalation delivery products. This team for example, pioneered the
    AERx� pulmonary delivery platform that was tested in thousands
    of patients with drugs and biologics including insulin, fentanyl,
    erythropoietin and nicotine. With the depth of experience and expertise in
    inhalation delivery, Aradigm is uniquely positioned to develop a portfolio
    of its own products to treat patients with severe respiratory diseases. The
    current pipeline includes an inhaled antibiotic being developed for the
    treatment of bronchiectasis*, cystic fibrosis and for biodefense, and
    inhaled nicotine for smoking cessation.

Aradigm Announces Top-Line Results from Two Phase 3 Studies Evaluating Pulmaquin for the Chronic Treatment of Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis Patients with Lung Infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa


Company to host conference call at 4:30 pm ET today

 HAYWARD, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Aradigm Corporation (NASDAQ:ARDM) (the "Company") today

      announced top-line results from its two Phase 3 clinical trials (ORBIT-3

      and ORBIT-4) evaluating the safety and efficacy of Pulmaquin®, the

      Company's investigational proprietary formulation of once daily

      ciprofloxacin for inhalation, in patients with non-cystic fibrosis

      bronchiectasis ("non-CF BE") with chronic lung infections with Pseudomonas

      aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).

    


      The ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4 pivotal trials were identical in design except

      for a pharmacokinetics sub-study that was conducted in one of the trials.
The primary endpoint in both ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4 was an increase

      in the median time to first mild, moderate or severe pulmonary

      exacerbation ("PE"). The key secondary efficacy endpoint in both trials

      was the frequency of PE's over the 48-week double-blind treatment period.

    


      In ORBIT-4 the median time to first mild, moderate or severe PE was 230

      days in the Pulmaquin treatment group as compared to 163 days in the

      placebo group. This increase in the median time to first PE was

      statistically significant (p=0.0462) using non-stratified log-rank

      analysis. In the key secondary efficacy endpoint, there was a 37%

      reduction in the frequency of PE's over the 48-week treatment period in

      the Pulmaquin treatment group as compared to the placebo group. This

      result was statistically significant (p=0.0007) with a Hazard Ratio of

      Pulmaquin/placebo of 0.63 using non-stratified binomial regression.

    


      In ORBIT-3 the median time to first mild, moderate or severe PE was 221

      days in the Pulmaquin treatment group as compared to 136 days in the

      placebo group. This increase in the median time to first PE was similar

      to ORBIT-4 but was not statistically significant (p=0.8488) using

      non-stratified log-rank analysis. In the key secondary efficacy

      endpoint, there was a 13% reduction in the frequency of PE's over the

      48-week treatment period in the Pulmaquin treatment group as compared to

      the placebo group. This result was not statistically significant

      (p=0.3125) with a Hazard Ratio of Pulmaquin/placebo of 0.87 using

      non-stratified binomial regression.

    


      The analyses of combined data from both studies resulted in a

      statistically significant reduction in the number of PE's over the

      48-week double-blind period (Hazard Ratio Pulmaquin/placebo: 0.73;

      p=0.0015), representing a 27% reduction in PE's over the period.

    


      When the additional analyses of combined data from both studies were

      conducted taking into account only PE's that were moderate or severe

      (i.e., those that required interventions with antibiotics or

      hospitalization) the median time to first PE in the Pulmaquin group was

      302 days vs. placebo 198 days (p=0.0217). There was also a statistically

      significant reduction in the number of moderate and severe PE's over the

      48-week double-blind period (Hazard Ratio Pulmaquin/placebo: 0.67;

      p=0.0002) using non-stratified analysis, representing a 33% reduction in

      PE's over the period.

    


      In each study, the treatment groups were stratified for gender,

      pre-trial frequency of exacerbations and smoking status. The Statistical

      Analysis Plan for the studies called for stratified analyses; however,

      since some strata were found to have no or very few subjects, both

      non-stratified and stratified analyses were conducted. The Company

      believes that due to the limited number of subjects in some strata the

      non-stratified analyses are more appropriate as strata that are too

      small can produce highly unstable estimated treatment effects with

      potential outliers. Using the stratified analyses, the median time to

      first PE in ORBIT-3 was Pulmaquin: 221 days; placebo: 136 days; p=0.7681

      and for ORBIT-4 was Pulmaquin: 230 days; placebo: 163 days; p=0.0885.

    


      Both studies demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in P.

      aeruginosa density at Day 28, the end of the first on-treatment

      period (ORBIT-3: p= < 0.0001; ORBIT-4: p= < 0.0001). For each study, the

      magnitude of this antibiotic effect remained persistent throughout all

      on-treatment periods.

    


      Pulmaquin was safe and well tolerated in both studies. There were no

      differences in the changes of lung function (FEV1 % predicted and FVC %

      predicted) or symptoms of airway irritation between the Pulmaquin and

      placebo groups in the two studies. Overall, the incidence of all

      treatment emergent adverse events ("TEAE") was similar between the

      Pulmaquin and placebo groups in both ORBIT-3 (Pulmaquin: 89.6%; placebo:

      91.6%) and ORBIT-4 (Pulmaquin: 86.4%; placebo: 96.9%). In ORBIT-3 the

      rates of serious TEAEs were 30.6% with Pulmaquin and 25.3% with placebo

      while in ORBIT-4 the rates were 17.0% versus 28.6%.

    


      For each study, the randomization rate of Pulmaquin treated subjects to

      placebo was 2 to 1. There were 8 deaths in ORBIT-3 (Pulmaquin: 5 (2.7%);

      placebo: 3 (3.2%)) and 6 deaths in ORBIT-4 (Pulmaquin: 2 (1.0%);

      placebo: 4 (4.1%)). None of the deaths was related to Pulmaquin or

      placebo. The most frequently observed treatment related TEAEs were of

      respiratory/thoracic/mediastinal nature and were reported in ORBIT-3 by

      25.7% of subjects with Pulmaquin and in 21.1% of subjects with placebo,

      while the rates in ORBIT-4 were 16.5% with Pulmaquin versus 19.4% with

      placebo.

    


      After the completion of the 48-week double-blind period, both Pulmaquin

      and placebo treated patients were given the opportunity to receive

      Pulmaquin in a 28-day open label extension period. Eighty-nine percent

      of the patients who completed ORBIT-3 and 91% percent of the patients

      who completed ORBIT-4 enrolled in the extension period.

    


      "Patients with non-cystic fibrosis BE chronically infected with P.

      aeruginosa have a particularly severe form of this disease. It is

      exciting to see that after many setbacks in the development of inhaled

      antibiotics to treat these patients we are finally seeing results with

      good safety and efficacy," said Dr. Anne O'Donnell, MD, Professor of

      Medicine and Chief, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep

      Medicine, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington DC, who was

      the Principal Investigator for the North American segment of the ORBIT-3

      and ORBIT-4 trials.

    


      "Chronic lung infections with P. aeruginosa are a growing global

      health care problem for patients with lung diseases like non-cystic

      fibrosis BE and COPD. In cystic fibrosis patients we have had success in

      treating chronic lung infections with inhaled antibiotics, and I am very

      pleased that Pulmaquin is demonstrating a reduction of pulmonary

      exacerbations in non-cystic fibrosis BE," said Dr. Charles Haworth MD

      FRCP, Director, Cambridge Centre for Lung Infection, Papworth Hospital,

      Cambridge, UK, who was the Principal Investigator for the Phase 3

      studies for ex-North American regions.

    


      The Company also announced that it has received the final statistical

      analysis report from the two year inhalation carcinogenicity study in

      rats with Pulmaquin; there were no differences in the rate of observed

      tumors between the Pulmaquin and control groups.

    


      "We sincerely thank all of the patients and investigators who

      participated in these studies for their commitment. We are delighted

      that once daily inhaled Pulmaquin is demonstrating a compelling

      reduction of pulmonary exacerbations and persistent antibiotic activity

      against P. aeruginosa infections, together with a good

      tolerability and safety profile in our Phase 3 clinical trials, as well

      as no carcinogenicity in animal studies. We will review the next steps

      towards an application for approval of Pulmaquin in the U.S. at an

      upcoming meeting scheduled with FDA and are planning to engage soon in

      discussions of these results with the EMA as well," said Dr. Juergen

      Froehlich, MD, Aradigm's Chief Medical Officer.

    

Aradigm has been granted orphan drug designation for Pulmaquin for

      non-CF BE in the U.S. In addition, FDA has designated Pulmaquin as a

      Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP). The QIDP designation is

      granted for treatment of non-CF BE patients with chronic lung infections

      with P. aeruginosa and made Pulmaquin eligible for Fast Track

      designation which was granted by the FDA in September 2014.

    


      Further data from the Phase 3 studies will be presented in future

      publications and medical meetings.

About Pulmaquin



      Pulmaquin is a dual release formulation composed of a mixture of

      liposome encapsulated and unencapsulated ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin,

      available in oral and intravenous formulations, is a widely prescribed

      antibiotic. It is used to treat acute lung infections and is often

      preferred because of its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against

      various bacteria, such as P. aeruginosa. Pulmaquin was evaluated

      in two Phase 3 studies to determine its safety and effectiveness as a

      once-a-day inhaled formulation for the chronic treatment of patients

      with non-CF BE who have chronic lung infections with P. aeruginosa.

    


      Following Phase 2a development of the liposomal portion of Pulmaquin

      (Lipoquin®) and Phase 1 development of Pulmaquin, the Phase 2b study

      ORBIT-2 with Pulmaquin was a 24-week multicenter, randomized,

      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 42 adult non-CF BE subjects.

      This study demonstrated a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa

      sputum density (p=0.002) and an increase in time to first exacerbation

      in the per protocol population (p=0.046) and the mITT (p=0.057)

      populations in the Pulmaquin treated subjects compared to placebo.

      Overall, the incidence of all treatment emergent adverse events was

      similar between groups. The most frequently reported treatment related

      adverse events (reported by ≥ 3 patients in either treatment group)

      included product taste abnormal and nausea in the Pulmaquin group and

      wheezing in the placebo group. No serious adverse events were considered

      treatment related. There were no deaths reported during ORBIT-2.

    


      The Phase 3 clinical program for Pulmaquin in non-CF BE consisted of two

      worldwide, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials (ORBIT-3 and

      ORBIT-4) that are identical in design except for a pharmacokinetics

      sub-study that was conducted in one of the trials. Each trial enrolled

      patients (278 in ORBIT-3 and 304 in ORBIT-4) into a 48-week double-blind

      period consisting of 6 cycles of 28 days on treatment with Pulmaquin or

      placebo plus 28 days off treatment, followed by a 28 day open label

      extension in which all participants received Pulmaquin (total treatment

      duration, including the double-blind period, of approximately one year).

      The superiority of Pulmaquin vs. placebo during the double-blind period

      was evaluated in terms of the time to first PE (primary endpoint), while

      key secondary endpoints included the reduction in the number of PE's and

      improvements in quality of life measures. Lung function was monitored as

      a safety indicator.

    

Aradigm has been granted orphan drug designations for liposomal

      ciprofloxacin as well as for ciprofloxacin for inhalation for non-CF BE

      in the U.S. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has

      designated Pulmaquin as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP).

      The QIDP designation is granted for treatment of non-CF BE patients with

      chronic lung infections with P. aeruginosa. The QIDP designation

      made Pulmaquin eligible for Fast Track designation which was granted by

      the FDA in September 2014.

    


      In 2013, Aradigm granted an exclusive, world-wide license for the

      Company's inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin product candidates for the

      indication of non-CF BE and other indications to Grifols S.A. More

      information on the terms of this license may be found in the Company's

      Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 filed

      with the SEC on March 13, 2014.

    

About Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis



      Non-CF BE is a severe, chronic and rare disease characterized by

      abnormal dilatation of the bronchi and bronchioles, frequently

      associated with chronic lung infections. It is often a consequence of a

      vicious cycle of inflammation, recurrent lung infections, and bronchial

      wall damage. Non-CF BE represents an unmet medical need with high

      morbidity and mortality that affects more than 150,000 people in the

      U.S. and over 200,000 people in Europe. There is currently no drug

      approved for the treatment of this condition.
