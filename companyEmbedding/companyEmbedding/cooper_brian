COOPER, Brian

From Encyclopedia Dubuque

Jump to: navigation, search

 COOPER, Brian E. (Alton, IL 1954- ). Executive editor and Editorial Board chairman of TH Media, whose products include the Telegraph Herald and THonline.com, since May 1986. TH Media is a division of Dubuque-based Woodward Communications, Inc.
Cooper came to Dubuque after four years as editor of The Ottumwa (Iowa) Courier (1982-86). He also held newsroom management positions at the Winona (Minn.) Daily News (1981-82) and The Quincy (Ill.) Herald-Whig (1976-80). Raised in the Chicago suburbs, he attended Western Illinois University for two years and then earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri-Columbia (1976). 
Cooper has received the Iowa Newspaper Association’s two highest honors, the Distinguished Service Award (1994) and Master Editor-Publisher Award (2009). He was named the recipient of the Stephen Berry Free Press Champion Award by the Iowa Center of Public Affairs Journalism-IowaWatch for promoting and showing by example the benefits of transparent government in Iowa.  The honor was given to a working journalist who ensured that the public's right to know was met. Cooper served on several committees and boards that exist to protect the First Amendment including the Iowa Newspaper Association's Government Relations Committee, Iowa Freedom of Information Council board of directors and as expanded news media coordinator for use of cameras in the courtrooms of Allamakee, Clayton, Delaware, and Dubuque counties. (1)
During his editorship of the Telegraph Herald, the newspaper launched the website THonline.com (January 1996), incorporated social media such as Twitter and Facebook as a means of disseminating news, launched magazines, resumed Saturday publication after an absence of six decades (August 1988), and converted from weekday afternoon to every-morning publication (September 1996).
One of his outside pursuits is writing non-fiction books. McCoy Group: A History of Commitment to the Customer, a commissioned work on the Dubuque-based truck-sales and transportation firm, was released in 2012. In 2014 his project was a commissioned corporate and family history of Dubuque riverboat and restaurant entrepreneurs Robert KEHL and his wife, Ruth. Two of Cooper’s three sports biographies are of Dubuque County natives: First Heisman: The Life of Jay Berwanger (2013, Crestwood Publishing) and Red Faber: A Biography of the Hall of Fame Spitball Pitcher (2007, McFarland & Co.) was a finalist for the Society for American Baseball Research’s Larry Ritter Award. He authored Ray Schalk: A Baseball Biography about Chicago White Sox catcher (2009, McFarland) and has written book chapters and magazine articles for the Society for American Baseball Research publications.
Cooper’s TH columns and editorials have received state and regional recognition. He has served as president of the Iowa Newspaper Foundation, Iowa Freedom of Information Council and Iowa Associated Press Managing Editors.  For more than 25 years, he has been an Expanded News Media Coverage regional coordinator, serving as a liaison among Iowa District Court officials and media outlets for electronic coverage of criminal trials. 
The announcement was made on December 2, 2016 that Cooper would step down as the executive editor of the Telegraph Herald. After thirty years, he would begin January 1, 2017 as the TH Editorial Board chairman, editorial page editor and a special projects resource. Cooper requested the opportunity as a transitional step toward retirement.

Building Your Minimal Viable Product (MVP) - Brian D. Cooper  | Brian D. Cooper

Brian D. Cooper

Learn by Doing: Entrepreneurial Approach to Commercial Real Estate











































Building Your Minimal Viable Product (MVP)


Eric Ries and Steve Blank are one of the early adopters of instigating a minimum viable product (MVP) as part of the startup process. Blank defines a MVP “not always a smaller/cheaper version of your final product. Defining the goal for a MVP can save you tons of time, money and grief.” Blank is an advocate for executing Learn Startup approach for almost a business. One strategy behind building and utilizing a MVP is not to use too many resources (eg. time and money). Get your MVP built quickly so you can start testing your hypothesis using the new product.

 

 
In 2013, Steve Blank published, Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything, in an issue of the Harvard Business Review. Blank describes the Learn Start-up provides an approach to starting a business less risky by emphasizing on experimentation and allowing your results to determine future decisions. The legacy approach to starting a business through elaborate planning has taken a backseat to the Lean Start-Up approach. Blank says the lean start-up movement has not yet gone mainstream and has stayed merely as a buzzword.
Eric Ries original definition of the MVP “is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning with the least effort.” The benefit of a MVP is you can start learning about your product immediately and begin testing your hypothesis and measuring your results. The results will provide insight on what areas of the MVP need some modifications made to it. When you begin this process make sure the tests you are implementing are producing measurable matrices. You want to be able to use your findings in a meaningful way to ultimately better your product.
 

 
Your new MVP is not something you will want to release to the general public. It is a product that you will keep close to you, give to every member of your team, and maybe a few reliable customers to test. This is how you can get reliable data and results. The initial users will also be able to provide feedback on how to make adjustments and fix any bugs that they encountered.
Roman Pichler 2013
 
 
 

 
5 steps to to Follow When Building Your Minimal Viable Product:
Step 1 – Create Your Vision

What is the overarching vision and direction for your product?

Step 2 – Is It Viable?

What do you need to have to test your idea to make sure it is viable?

Step 3 – Craft the Prototypes

Brainstorm your ideas. If you want some direction on brainstorming visit my blog post on brainstorming.

Step 4 – Test the Prototypes

You will need to start testing your MVP. Keep in consideration that you might have more than one MVP and will need to gather feedback on multiple prototypes.

Step 5 – Iterate

Now using all your data, feedback, and results, you will want to go back with your team and start making iterations to your existing MVP.

 

 
 
 
My challenge for you is to create a MVP!
Ready, Set, Innovate…

            COMMENTEMAILMOREA Plainfield, Ill., man was sentenced in Door County Circuit Court Thursday to two consecutive life sentences without parole for the murder of his pregnant friend and her unborn baby.Brian M. Cooper, 37, was found guilty in May of two counts of first-degree intentional homicide for the Aug. 19, 2012, strangulation death of Alisha Bromfield, 21, also of Plainfield, and her unborn baby, Ava. He was not the baby's father. Cooper killed Bromfield at a Nasewaupee resort after he spent the night drinking heavily. The two were in town to attend his sister Kellie Stryker's wedding.Thursday's sentencing encompasses both the guilty verdict for third-degree sexual assault from Cooper's first trial and the two guilty verdicts for first-degree intentional homicide. The sexual assault charge was filed because Cooper had sex with the body.Before handing down the sentence, Judge D. Todd Ehlers spoke of several things Cooper said and did that he did not think spoke well of Cooper's "character."This included the spy cameras Cooper used to record Bromfield in Door County and his Plainfield home, changing the password on his phone to Bromfield's birthday after they came to Door County, and Cooper's statement to the judge Thursday."The final character issue, which I didn't know how this was all going to come down this afternoon, Mr. Cooper. But I just heard your statement, I listened to you read your poems," Ehlers said. "I didn't hear an apology to the family of Alisha and Ava … and that is troubling for me.

    Samantha Hernandez/Door County AdvocateHe also played a video that had been used in the trial of Cooper hiding a spy camera in the bathroom garbage can of the hotel room that he and Bromfield were sharing."What I realized as I watched that during the first trial and I watched during the second trial, is that that's the last view that Alisha Bromfield had as you were straddled over her body, as you were strangling the life out of her," Ehlers said. "She looked up into your eyes just like you were looking into that garbage can. And that just sends chills to me to the point that that is the last thing she saw."Buy Photo (Photo:

)The judge said several of the letters he received from Bromfield's friends and family referenced this very observation.Ehlers also spoke about how the forensic pathologist's description of Bromfield's body after the attack impacted him. The doctor's description included details of broken bones, contusions and hematomas, among other injuries."That testimony from the doctor about the brutality of this assault and the ultimate murder of Alisha and her child is extremely troubling to me," he said. "I consider, Mr. Cooper, the severity of the whole offense not just the strangulation but the assault you imposed on the body of Alisha Bromfield to be an extremely troubling factor."Buy Photo (Photo:

)Besides the two life sentences, Cooper also received a sentence of two years for the sexual assault followed by two years of extended supervision. Cooper will also have to pay restitution of more than $8,000. District Attorney Raymond Pelrine said the funds would be used for funeral expenses.Pelrine told the press he felted "vindicated" after the sentencing."It's not the sort of thing that you can express happiness, joy or excitement about, because it's always been a tragedy every step of the way. And it continues to be and it always will be for the families," he said.Buy Photo (Photo: 
Heidi Hodges/For the Door County Advocate
)Pelrine said he could not think of just one moment from the case that he would deem the most difficult."I can't really think of one thing. It's been a slog. I don't mean to put myself in any way in the position of the folks in the family. I can't pretend to do that," he said. "But all cases take a bit out of you. A case that goes on for two years – two weeklong trials involving the deaths of a young woman and her unborn child and including the stakes of a person spending the rest of their natural life behind bars – so I can't think of anything that is more taxing, more draining than that."'Forgiven'Before Ehlers imposed the sentence, he heard statements from several witnesses and Cooper himself. Connie Cooper spoke on behalf of her son."I don't know what God's plan was for my son that day, but I know God has forgiven him," she said. She read comments from Cooper's friends and his cousin Reid Paxson Jr., who had testified on Cooper's behalf during the trial.At one point she told Cooper she loved him and turned to the audience and said the same to Stryker, who was sitting with her husband and Bromfield's family and friends.Buy Photo (Photo:

)Cooper used his time to speak to read a written statement and two poems he wrote.According to Cooper, he and Bromfield enjoyed eating together, taking work trips and going on everyday outings, watching the show "24" and spending time with his dog."We both cherished all those days not only because of our dedication to our job but because we enjoyed each other's company," he read.Cooper said they also talked a lot of about Bromfield's pregnancy."She thanked me for all the support I had given her," he said. He praised her strength.Cooper said "it is extremely difficult" for him to comprehend how such a "horrific event" had occurred."Along with all the remorse, regret and shame that streams down through my veins each and every day, I have come to the assumption that there are really no words I can truly say to express how sorry I am that such tragedy did happen and the fact that I did cause the death of Alisha and Ava Bromfield," he said, his voice breaking. "There was never even for a second any intention or plan of this. I will show with my actions that I will eternally show with my love both of these beautiful women."Victim impactBromfield's parents and one of her friends spoke to the judge about the impact of her death."The emotional pain is difficult to describe ... unless you've lost a child," her mother, Sherry Anicich, said.During their statements Cooper looked red-faced and repeatedly dabbed at his nose and eyes. He stared at the people as they delivered their statements. He did not appear to look at his mother much during her statement.The family also showed a video featuring movies and photos of Bromfield at different stages of her life.One of the last scenes in the video was of Bromfield waving goodbye.Contact Samantha Hernandez at svhernande@doorcountyadvocate.com or (920) 743-3321, Ext. 112.

GET GRIT
NPMS teachers developed a GET GRIT Program.  GET GRIT is an acronym for Goal Setting, Evaluate Your Challenge, Try A Strategy, Give Yourself A Chance, Reach For Resources, Initiate Communication and Track Your Success. GET GRIT is considered a key contributor to success. The teachers devise the goal in order to enhance student's independence with respect to responsibility, perseverance and problem-solving. Through challenges taught in the classroom, students learn to overcome obstacles and have an opportunity to achieve success. Teachers also hung posters in classrooms and handed out bookmarks to every student, emphasizing the initials and words GET GRIT represents.
