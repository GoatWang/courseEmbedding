Who we are

Uniquely passionate entrepreneurs.
We back the best and most ambitious entrepreneurs and help them make their ideas real and lasting. The entrepreneurs we team up with were born to build their businesses -- it is their life’s mission. Working side-by-side with these visionaries makes us incredibly optimistic about the future. The transformative companies they’re building, include: Adyen, Dropbox, Etsy, Sonos, SoundCloud, King, BlaBlaCar, Squarespace, Just Eat, Lookout, Hortonworks, Pure Storage, Supercell, Criteo, Funding Circle and many others.
Full attention of our partnership.
To us, providing full-service means giving you the full attention of our partnership. We structurally de-emphasize individual partner achievements to provide you with the full partnerships’ collective experience and expertise. Access to one means access to all. As our founding partner, Gerald Rimer, likes to say, “We’re not a family business, we’re a business family.”
Global ambitions.
We believe that passionate entrepreneurs can come from anywhere. We’ve supported consumer and enterprise technology entrepreneurs in 39 cities around the world and have helped them as they grow into new regions. Our physical presence in San Francisco, London and Geneva serve as places where our entrepreneurs can come together, and as jumping off points to discover what’s next.
 






Our history

Founded in Geneva in 1996 by Neil Rimer, Giuseppe Zocco, David Rimer.
Principal offices: London and San Francisco.
Most recent funds: early-stage fund (Index Ventures 8) & growth fund (Index Growth 3).

Shared Vision

Think of what you could achieve if you believed you couldn’t fail. We love fearless entrepreneurs, who see building a transformational business as their destiny. We love teams who see opportunity where others just see obstacles. We love companies that challenge convention and break the rules … just a bit. Above all, we love building lifelong relationships with the entrepreneurs we back, which are based on trust, respect and a shared vision.
