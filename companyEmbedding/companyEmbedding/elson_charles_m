Product description:The most trusted M&A guidebook available--updated for today's extreme-risk world of business.Major financial scandals, geopolitical upheaval, technological advances, rapid globalization . . . The world--and the way business is done--has changed drastically in the 10 short years since the original publication of this book. As a result, the already tedious M&A process has become exponentially more complex.The most trusted guidebook of its kind, The Art of M&A Due Diligence helps you uncover problems and inconsistencies in an M&A deal while they're still manageable. You’ll find everything you need to mitigate all types of traditional risk—financial (key ratios, new GAAP-IFRS standards), operational (background checks, on-site visits), transactional (verification, checking warranties), and legal (intellectual property, environmental law).This new edition also addresses complications introduced over the past decade by including:New information about the use of electronic data  rooms for due diligenceNew focus on the role of International Accounting StandardsNew tools for Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) complianceNew regulations concerning the environment and social issuesNew case law of interest, including key decisions  of the Delaware Chancery Court and Delaware Supreme CourtThe fear of risk in an M&A deal is rational, but it shouldn't prevent you from moving ahead. A well-conceived, carefully executed merger or acquisition can be extraordinarily enriching for both buyer and seller. This step-by-step guidebook is all you need to know where to look—and what to look for--when conducting M&A due diligence.A merger or acquisition deal can be a profi table springboard to long-term success--or it can be a costly disaster. The key to experiencing the former and preventing the latter is a sound, effective due diligence process.The Art of M&A Due Diligence, second edition, is extensively updated to provide new, critical information you need today. Signifi cant regulatory and legal developments have occurred over the past decade, and this new edition ensures that you'll be fully prepared for them. It accounts for noteworthy business trends and global economic events by providing:The latest tools for detecting and mitigating risk (9/11)An expanded checklist with more insolvency warning signs (WorldCom)Guidance on what companies can and cannot delegate to their advisors (Arthur Andersen)A new chapter on due diligence for fi nancial institutions to account for EESA-related changes (2010 legacy of TARP)Alexandra Reed Lajoux is Chief Knowledge Officer and Corporate Secretary at the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD), a not-for-profi t organization dedicated to educating corporate directors.

When a Spin-off is on the Board's Agenda

Director and Boards, Vol. 21, No. 2 (1997).


Posted: 14 Mar 1997

Abstract
This article examines the rapidly escalating public company "spin-off" phenomenon. The authors challenge the conventional wisdom that such activity enhances shareholders value and suggests that it may sometimes have a non-corporate wealth enhancing purpose. Spin-offs may often be the result of a fee-driven investment banking environment or even the product of a chief executive seeking to further personal rather than corporate interests such as delaying a mandatory retirement or removing a potential rival from the organization. The authors thus argue that these spin-offs create a number of important corporate governance issues, the most significant of which, in addition to the fundamental question of whether to spin-off a division at all, is the governance structure of the newly spun-off operation. The new company's board structure, they argue, will be vital to assuring both the success of the new venture and the continued health of the parent organization.
