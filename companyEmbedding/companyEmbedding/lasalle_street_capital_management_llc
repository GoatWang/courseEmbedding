“LaSalle Street Capital Management is 100% employee owned”




About Us – Investment Professionals


Overview


	      LaSalle Street Capital Management, LLC is comprised of seasoned professionals
	      who have had established working relationships with each other for a number of years.
	      Four of the founding individuals worked together at their prior investment
	      management firm. The firm is 100% employee owned.
          

	      Several members of the team have
	      “hands-on” business operating experience. This is invaluable from two standpoints:
	      first, it enables us to better identify potential opportunities or pitfalls associated with
	      any investments; second, it helps keep our business operating smoothly. Clients should benefit from both.

MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $78.00 (1.56% upside)
