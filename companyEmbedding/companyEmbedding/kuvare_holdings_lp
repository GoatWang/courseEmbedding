Kuvare Activates Platform with Closing of GILICO Acquisition & 
      Formation of Reinsurance Co.




With GILICO and KLR in place, Kuvare’s platform to provide life and 
      annuity solutions to middle-market customers will continue to grow 
      through its acquisition-led strategy






October 07, 2016 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kuvare Holdings LP (“Kuvare” or “The Company”), a growth-oriented 
      insurance platform, is pleased to announce the completion of its 
      purchase of Guaranty Income Life Insurance Company (“GILICO”) and, 
      separately, the establishment of a new reinsurer, Kuvare Life Re Ltd. 
      (“KLR”), and execution of a closed-block reinsurance transaction with a 
      highly rated insurance company. With the completion of these two 
      transactions, Kuvare’s consolidated assets exceed $1 billion.
    


      GILICO, a Legal Reserve Life Insurance Company based in Baton Rouge, LA, 
      is licensed in 31 states and focuses on protecting middle-market 
      customers through the sale of annuities, life insurance and supplemental 
      insurance products. Kuvare’s acquisition received final approval from 
      the Louisiana Department of Insurance last week. GILICO’s headquarters, 
      management team and staff will remain in Baton Rouge.
    

      KLR’s initial reinsurance transaction includes a portfolio of fixed 
      annuity products from a highly rated insurance company. In establishing 
      KLR, a Bermuda Monetary Authority, registered Class E Insurer, Kuvare is 
      well positioned to provide flexible capital solutions to the life 
      insurance and annuity market.
    

      “It has been a pleasure to work with GILICO’s management team over the 
      last year and we look forward to continuing to work with them as we 
      expand the business and seek new opportunities in the years to come,” 
      said Kuvare CEO Dhiren Jhaveri. “With GILICO and KLR, Kuvare’s platform 
      is now well equipped to serve middle-market customers. These strategic 
      acquisitions are the foundation for our operating model going forward – 
      unlocking growth by expanding product breadth and distribution, as well 
      as implementing tactical asset management strategies and partnering with 
      insurance carriers to provide additional services and solutions.”
    

      “We look forward to expanding Kuvare’s capabilities, as we continue to 
      grow new products and services for middle-market customers,” added 
      Jhaveri. For the GILICO transaction, Sandler O’Neill + Partners, L.P. 
      was the financial advisor to Kuvare, with Sidley Austin LLP and Jones 
      Walker LLP acting as legal counsel. For the formation of KLR and 
      execution of the initial reinsurance transaction, Appleby (Bermuda) 
      Limited and Sidley Austin LLP served as legal counsel.

PRESS RELEASE
Chicago – October 7, 2016. Kuvare Holdings LP (“Kuvare” or “The Company”), a growth-oriented insurance platform, is pleased to announce the completion of its purchase of Guaranty Income Life Insurance Company (“GILICO”) and, separately, the establishment of a new reinsurer, Kuvare Life Re Ltd. (“KLR”), and execution of a closed-block reinsurance transaction with a highly rated insurance company. With the completion of these two transactions, Kuvare’s consolidated assets exceed $1 billion.
GILICO, a Legal Reserve Life Insurance Company based in Baton Rouge, LA, is licensed in 31 states and focuses on protecting middle-market customers through the sale of annuities, life insurance and supplemental insurance products. Kuvare’s acquisition received final approval from the Louisiana Department of Insurance last week. GILICO’s headquarters, management team and staff will remain in Baton Rouge.
KLR’s initial reinsurance transaction includes a portfolio of fixed annuity products from a highly rated insurance company. In establishing KLR, a Bermuda Monetary Authority, registered Class E Insurer, Kuvare is well positioned to provide flexible capital solutions to the life insurance and annuity market. 





“It has been a pleasure to work with GILICO’s management team over the last year and we look forward to continuing to work with them as we expand the business and seek new opportunities in the years to come,” said Kuvare CEO Dhiren Jhaveri. “With GILICO and KLR, Kuvare’s platform is now well equipped to serve middle-market customers. These strategic acquisitions are the foundation for our operating model going forward – unlocking growth by expanding product breadth and distribution, as well as implementing tactical asset management strategies and partnering with insurance carriers to provide additional services and solutions.”
“We look forward to expanding Kuvare’s capabilities, as we continue to grow new products and services for middle-market customers,” added Jhaveri. For the GILICO transaction, Sandler O’Neill + Partners, L.P. was the financial advisor to Kuvare, with Sidley Austin LLP and Jones Walker LLP acting as legal counsel. For the formation of KLR and execution of the initial reinsurance transaction, Appleby (Bermuda) Limited and Sidley Austin LLP served as legal counsel.
