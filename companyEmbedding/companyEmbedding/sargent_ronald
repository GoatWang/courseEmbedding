Corporate Responsibility A Letter from Shira Goodman 
				



Letter from Shira Goodman
September 2016
Dear Stakeholders,
Staples officially turned 30 years old this year. A lot has changed over the last three decades, transforming the retail and B2B industries in which we operate. A few of the many differences include the shift from bricks and mortar to eCommerce; changes in core office product use as technology adoption has flourished; new delivery supply chain models; and evolving approaches and expectations related to corporate responsibility. Among all of the change we’ve seen and that the future will bring, one thing is clear — we are laser focused on evolving our business to deliver more value for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.
To further refine and strengthen our corporate responsibility strategy, late in 2015 we conducted a materiality assessment. The assessment looked at broader social and environmental issues and trends globally around corporate responsibility; internal and external stakeholder requests and interactions with Staples; and survey results from a diverse group of Staples associates about a large set of issues. The findings (shared throughout the website and detailed in this section) identified a number of topics that are important both to Staples as a company and to our stakeholders.
Some of the top issues identified included sustainable products (including responsible sourcing), governance, data and customer privacy, recycling services, workplace, diversity and inclusion, sustainable operations, and community support. This past year, Staples had several positive achievements in these areas that we’ve highlighted throughout this website and in Staples’ 2015 Annual Report.
For example:

We sold more than $5.21 billion in products with environmental features in 2015, equal to about 29 percent of our total product sales globally.
We donated more than $13 million to non-profit organizations around the world.
We were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 12th straight year.
We launched a dedicated website, www.StaplesDiversity.com, focused on showcasing our diverse workforce and inclusive culture to job seekers and published Gender Transition at Staples guidelines.
We recycled more than 26 million pounds of eWaste for customers globally in 2015, continuing to make progress toward our goal of collecting 40 million pounds annually by 2020.

For more detail on the goals we’ve established to keep these programs moving forward, see the Goals section of our website. For performance updates against our key corporate responsibility indicators, see our detailed Performance Summary.
The next few years will prove to be exciting times for Staples as we continue to transform our business. This includes traditional areas like growing sales profitably, managing costs, and always putting the customer first.  But it also includes making sure we foster a diverse, engaged and collaborative work culture; we give back to the communities we touch; we make it easy for our customers to be more sustainable; and we protect the people and the planet upon which we all depend.
Thank you for your interest in Staples’ corporate responsibility programs, and we hope you find this website and report helpful as you learn more about all the things we do.
Sincerely,Shira GoodmanCEO

Ronald Sargent has no Easy Button when it comes to steering
    Staples through the economic downturn, but the CEOs
    three-pronged strategy for the office products superstore has
    impressed shareholders.
Sargent  a 20-year veteran of Framingham,
    Massachusettsbased Staples  focuses on taking care
    of customers, hunkering down on expenses and investing in the
    future. "The most important thing you can do is to maintain, or
    even strengthen, your relationships with your customers," he
    says. Staples is coaching its sales associates to provide
    customers with more assistance and emphasize value by focusing
    on the often less expensive Staples brand. The company has also
    begun offering a free computer tune-up service to lure
    customers.
Sargent believes in looking at every expense in the
    corporate budget. "In this economy, where retail sales are
    down, its really important that you squeeze every
    nickel," he explains. In 2008, Staples shed 2,000 jobs,
    eliminated executive bonuses and froze senior management
    salaries through 2009.
Sargent is also making sure to invest for future growth.
    Staples acquired Corporate Express, a Dutch office products
    supplier, in July 2008 for $4.8 billion in a bid to capture
    large-company contracts in North America and Europe. Staples
    expects the combined entity to generate cost savings of as much
    as $300 million. But the economic slowdown is taking a toll.
    For the three months ended in January, Staples posted net
    income of $286.1 million, down from $333.2 million a year
    earlier.
"Ron is one of the best CEOs I have encountered," says one
    mutual fund manager. "[Witness his] acquiring Corporate Express
    at a reasonable price, integrating the company quickly into
    Staples and [operating it] very well in the worst job
    environment in 60 years."
* Fiscal year ended January 31, 2008.
