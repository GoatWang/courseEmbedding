R & D Approach






Design, Innovation, Quality, and Added Value


Product Development
Our Focus
Each day cannabis growers face the challenge of  growing more from less -- increasing yield, reduce costs, increase productivity  and profitability.  OptiLeaf's hardware  and software engineers are working hard to create a solution to help growers  succeed in this demanding arena.
            
 This means we focus on providing the best technology  to address their needs, be it a single technology, or a combination of  technologies and services.  By merging  our deep understanding of the cannabis cultivation business with our strong  technology foresight, we can ensure that we will deliver leading-edge  technological solution for the future. This solution will transform the cannabis  industry.
            
OptiLeaf  R&  D organization is setup so that we continue to develop and optimize our  seed-to-sale growth management system and our wireless sensor network (networks  of devices that control, monitor, and automate every aspect of grow house  operation). 
            
To complement our in-house expertise and bring in  novel technologies which may or may not be used in cannabis cultivation  industry, we are actively seeking value-adding partnerships and collaborations  to bring exciting new offers to the growers.
            
Our Strategies
OptiLeaf’s strategies behind the development of our  products are based on design, innovation, and added value.  When  developing new products, we want to be the leader by introducing innovative  systems that will allow cannabis cultivators to lower their costs, boost  yields, and maximize production capacity.  Furthermore, when OptiLeaf  develops new goods or services, we will package them with support services as  well as immediate observable and psychological benefits.  Our focus is on  how our products and services stand against the competition and how our  technical measures relate to the customers’ needs.
            
Our primary strategy is to focus on quality.   Our products must meet our eight dimensions of quality:   performance, features, reliability, conformance, durability, serviceability,  aesthetics, and perceived quality.  Based on our strategies, we believe  OptiLeaf's products and services will be superior to the competition.

Cannabis Industry









According to Arcview, a leading source of information for the industry, cannabis is currently a $2.3 billion industry, and is projected to grow to $10.2 billion by 2018.




The Market is composed of individuals who legally consume marijuana as allowed by state laws, as well as the businesses that constitute the supply chain to serve those consumers. These businesses include the cannabis cultivation operation, dispensary, and caregiver.




Our technology will allow cultivation sites to lower costs, boost yields, and maximize production capacity. The decisions that cannabis cultivation businesses make today will play a huge role in whether or not they will be successful in years to come.




A recent Gallup poll (2012-2013) shows increased support for the legalization of cannabis, with 58% of the U.S. population now supporting the idea.




Currently in the state of Washington and Colorado, all adults 21 and older can legally purchase cannabis from any licensed retailers.




Obtaining maximum efficiency gain through automation and production integration will be vital to the success of all licensed cannabis businesses in the legalized medical marijuana states.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The information and financial data discussed below is derived from our unaudited financial statements, herein, for the period from inception, August 11, 2014 through March 31, 2017. The unaudited financial statements were prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The information and financial data discussed below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the related notes contained elsewhere in this prospectus. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus fully represent our financial condition and operations; however, they are not indicative of our future performance.  Overview  We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on August 11, 2014. OptiLeaf, Inc. was formed to provide a world-class fully integrated turn-key growth management system for the cannabis industry to help dispensary owners, grow operations and caregivers increase their sales and reduce costs, increase their company's productivity and profitability and reduce or eliminate the need for manual labor while maximizing yield. We are presently a development stage company with no customers, sales, suppliers, or inventory as of this filing.  OptiLeaf's target market includes dispensaries and grow operations.  OptiLeaf has completed the development of its Grow Pro and POS management software. Both products are being beta tested in the state of Colorado and we are currently looking for beta testers in the states of Washington and Oregon. Optileaf has completed integration with Metric in the State of Colorado and Oregon and with BioTrack in the state of Washington.  Optileaf plans on commencing the development of its wireless network censors in the latter half of 2017. We believe our integrated hardware will be capable of monitoring and adjusting light, soil moisture, CO2, temperature, ventilation, nutrients, and humidity as needed, in real time and around-the-clock.  Our Product  Once developed, the heart of our system will be the innovative multi-purpose growth management software suite. OptiLeaf plans to add proprietary hardware components, which we believe, together with software, will provide a turn-key growth management system. The system, once developed and implemented, will potentially allow growers to realize significant labor savings as common grow house tasks are fully automated. Once developed, we believe our integrated hardware is capable of monitoring and adjusting light, soil moisture, CO2, temperature, ventilation, nutrients, and humidity as needed, in real time and around-the-clock. Once developed, we believe our user interface, data tracking, and remote access capabilities could potentially allow growers to monitor, adjust, and manage their facilities as needed from anywhere in the world, however, none of our products are fully developed or available for sale or use at this time, and there can be no assurance that our products will ever become fully developed, or will gain market acceptance when and if fully developed.  In the period from inception (August 11, 2014) through March 31, 2017 we had approximately $7,500 of other income and our net loss was approximately $544,000. As of March 31, 2017, we had total current assets of approximately $135,000 and total current liabilities of approximately $11,000.  Our Strategy  OptiLeaf will offer a complete line of hardware and software technological solution for the cannabis industry.  Our software is a seed-to-sale growth management system, designed to not only offer a complete grow automation system, but to enhance every aspect of the medical cannabis business.  Our wireless sensor networks will include an array of products that control, monitor, and automate all aspects of the grow house operations. Our principal product, OptiLeaf GrowPro Elite, provides a complete, robust state-of-the-art hardware and software solution for large cultivation operations with multiple locations.  The heart of our system will be a multi-purpose growth management software suite. OptiLeaf will add proprietary hardware components, which, together with software, will provide a turn-key growth management system. The system will potentially allow growers to realize significant labor savings as common grow house tasks are fully automated. Our integrated hardware is capable of monitoring and adjusting light, soil moisture, CO2, temperature, ventilation, nutrients, and humidity as needed, in real time and around-the-clock. Our user interface, data tracking, and remote access capabilities allow growers to monitor, adjust, and manage their facilities as needed from anywhere in the world.  Our products will be manufactured in the USA and Asia, managed by a team possessing years of experience with domestic and overseas production. OptiLeaf does not directly distribute, sell, grow, harvest cannabis or any substances that violate United States law or the Controlled Substances Act, nor does it intend to do so in the future.  While individual components of our system are available from our main competitors, OptiLeaf believes it will have the first and only system to completely integrate all aspects of growth automation and management into one system.  Marketing  OptiLeaf will focus its sales and marketing efforts in the states of Colorado, Oregon and Washington at this point. Once the rules and regulations for the state of California are introduced, we plan to expand our marketing efforts into that state as well. We have decided to focus our efforts with the most developed and broadest customer base at this point.  We are currently in the process of interviewing and hiring for full time marketing and sales personnel in Colorado, Oregon and Washington.  There are a total of 7,300 potential customers in the states of Colorado, Oregon and Washington.  Operations  OptiLeaf's operational strategies behind the development of our products and services are based on design, innovation, and added value. When developing a new product, we want to be the leader by introducing innovative features that will allow cannabis cultivators to lower their costs, boost yields, and maximize production capacity. Furthermore, when OptiLeaf develops new goods or services, we will package them with support services as well as immediate observable and psychological benefits. Our focus is on how our products and services stand against the competition and how our technical measures relate to the customers' needs.  Over the next twelve months, we anticipate expenses of up to $225,000 including general, administrative and corporate expenses. The extent of such expenses will depend upon the successful implementation of our financing strategy and the acceleration of our business plan accordingly.  We expect to finance our operations primarily through our existing cash, our operations and any future financing. If we do not obtain additional funding, we will continue to operate on a reduced budget until such time as more capital is raised. We believe that we could operate with our current cash on hand while satisfying any shortfall in cash flow with income that will be generated after the launch of our sales and marketing programs. However, to effectively implement our business plan, we will need to obtain additional financing in the future.  If we obtain financing, we would expect to accelerate our business plan and increase our advertising and marketing budget, hire additional staff members, and increase our office space and operations all of which we believe would result in the generation of revenue and profit for our company.  Results of Operations  We have conducted minimal operations during the period from inception (August 11, 2014) to March 31, 2017. We generated other income of approximately $7,500 during this period. We had net losses of approximately $544,000 for the period from inception (August 11, 2014) to March 31, 2017.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of March 31, 2017, we had cash of $127,375. Our primary uses of cash were for employee compensation and working capital. The main sources of cash were from our Founders and Private Placement of securities. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to long term:  ? An increase in working capital requirements,  ? Addition of administrative and sales personnel as the business grows,  ? Increases in advertising, public relations and sales promotions as we commence operations,  ? Research and Development,  ? The cost of being a public company and the continued increase in costs due to governmental compliance activities.  The following summarizes the key components of the Company's cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 .  May 22, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the sale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the
registration of the shares for the selling security holders.


Not Specified.


Company Description
OptiLeaf, Inc. was formed to provide a world-class fully integrated turn-key 
growth management system for the cannabis industry to help dispensary owners, 
grow operations and caregivers increase their sales and reduce costs, increase
their company’s productivity and profitability and reduce or


 eliminate the need
for manual labor while maximizing yield. We presently have no customers, sales,
suppliers or inventory as of this filing.

Until such time as we obtain revenue other than nominal revenue and commence
business operations, we will be considered a Shell Company under Rule 405 of the
Securities Act. As a result, our Shareholders will not be able to avail
themselves of certain exemptions regarding the sale of their shares under Rule
144 until one year from the date on which our Company has filed certain 
information with the SEC indicating we are no longer a shell company.

OptiLeaf’s target market will include dispensary owners, grow operations, and
caregivers. We believe this industry will continue to grow, and as it does we
will have a greater number of potential customers for our product. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to capture any portion of this market.

OptiLeaf will endeavor to offer a complete line of hardware and software
technological solution for the cannabis industry. Our software, once developed,
will be a seed-to-sale growth management system, designed to not only offer a
complete grow automation system, but to enhance every aspect of the medical
cannabis business. We believe our wireless sensor networks, once developed, will
include an array of products that control, monitor, and automate all aspects of
the grow house operations. We believe our principal product, OptiLeaf GrowPro
Elite, will, once developed, provide a complete, robust state-of-the-art
hardware and software solution for large cultivation operations with multiple
locations. We have not completed development of any products as of this
Offering, and there can be no assurance that any such products will be finalized
and brought to market, or that the products will gain market acceptance if they
are.

We are endeavoring to build a multi-purpose growth management software suite.
OptiLeaf has added proprietary hardware components, which, together with
software, provide a turn-key growth management system. We believe the system
will allow growers to realize significant labor savings as common grow house
tasks are fully automated. We believe our integrated hardware will be capable of
monitoring and adjusting light, soil moisture, CO2, temperature, ventilation,
nutrients, and humidity as needed, in real time and around-the-clock. Our user
interface, data tracking, and remote access capabilities allow growers to
monitor, adjust, and manage their facilities as needed from anywhere in the
world. We have not completed development of any products as of this Offering,
and there can be no assurance that our software will be fully developed or that
it will gain market acceptance once it is.

Once developed, it is our plan that our products will be manufactured in the USA
and Asia, managed by a team possessing years of experience with domestic and
overseas production. OptiLeaf does not directly distribute, sell, grow, harvest
cannabis or any substances that violate United States law or the Controlled
Substances Act, nor does it intend to do so in the future.

While individual components of our contemplated system are available from our
main competitors, OptiLeaf believes it will have the first and only system to
completely integrate all aspects of growth automation and management into one
system.

We will be, when and if our products our developed, a technology provider to the
cannabis industry. As such, we are operating within an industry that is very
complex in terms of legal requirements and compliance. Cannabis is an illegal
drug under Federal Law, and is illegal in many states as well. Certain states
have made cannabis legal for medicinal use only, but in very few circumstances
is it legal to possess or sell cannabis. Although we plan on being a technology
provider only, and do not plan of growing, selling or possessing any cannabis,
we nevertheless must comply with, and our business must comply with, a myriad of
state and local laws and regulations regarding our operations, and our
operations, as well as our profitability, can be significantly affected by all
of these laws and how they affect the businesses or our customers. OptiLeaf does
not, and will not, grow, harvest or sell cannabis or any other controlled
substance, as that term is defined under any federal, state or local law. There
can be no assurance that we will finalize development of our products, or gain
market acceptance for the products when and if fully developed.

As of August 2014, we have taken the following steps to become an operating
company:

1. We finished and launched our website www.optileaf.com.

2. We engaged the services of Byrd & Byrd, PL as our legal counsel.

3. We created our innovative multi-purpose growth management software suite and  
   added proprietary hardware components, which together with our software 
   suite, provide a turn-key growth management system.

4. We registered our trademark “OptiLeaf” and our slogan “Technology for Optimal 
   Growth with the USPTO (United States Patent Trademark Office).                

During the next 12 months we intend to take the following additional steps to
market our products and services:

1. Once our products are developed, we will educate consumers to differentiate   
   our products from the competition thus giving them the confidence to try
   something new.

2. OptiLeaf’s marketing strategy is to aggressively enhance, promote, and 
   support the significant benefits of our growth management software and our
   array of wireless sensor network products. We will endeavor to sell our 
   products direct to consumers who are registered growers, dispensaries, and 
   caregivers. Marketing will be directed to those contained in the readily 
   available database. However, as a new company with no proven sales record, we
   cannot be certain as to our rate of market penetration, or as to the market
   acceptance of our products. 

We plan on driving our complete line of products through our online showroom.
Our plan is to launch product sales first from our website and database
marketing, generating cash flow before we move into the retail channel. These
marketing strategies were chosen because we believe they will provide the most
direct access to the greatest number of potential customers.

Our advertising and promotion strategy is to position OptiLeaf as the leading
technological solution provider for the cannabis market. We will endeavor to
track, whenever possible, all revenues generated from our advertising,
promotion, and publicity efforts.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
