Our History
During the summer of 1922, a young Franklin, North Carolina attorney, Gilmer A. Jones, had the idea of organizing a building and loan association. It was to have a long-term impact on the progress in Macon County. He recognized an urgent need for an institution offering citizens an opportunity to become homeowners, and a depository that would pay a good rate of interest on individual savings in Macon County. The Franklin Press dated August 25, 1922, stated: “An organization that is destined to do more for the upbuilding of our town than anything that has ever been attempted here was formed last Saturday night.” Mr. Jones’ idea became reality on October 6, 1922, when the Macon County Building and Loan Association opened its office upstairs above the Bank of Franklin Building.
The association remained small for several years. Even during the real estate “bust” and the Great Depression of the early 1930’s, not a penny was lost on a loan. By 1963, assets had grown to $2.6 million. The original small office had become inadequate and a full time manager was needed. In 1964 the Association moved to a building at the corner of West Main and Maple Street. That same year they signed up for insurance of deposits provided by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The rate of growth increased sharply thereafter.
In October of 1972, Macon Building and Loan Association changed its name to Macon Savings and Loan Association. Macon Savings continued to grow and as the bank approached its 60th year opened its first branch office in downtown Murphy in 1981.
In 1985, Franklin’s main branch moved into the new colonial-style building located in the heart of downtown Franklin. On June 25, 1988, during a severe electrical storm, the building was struck by lightning and completely destroyed. Although disaster had struck, Macon Savings never missed an hour of service. The drive-thru lanes were kept open and other operations were moved to the Maple Street location until reconstruction was completed a year later.
Macon Savings and Loan Association became Macon Savings Bank in 1989 and continued to enjoy record growth. Since 1993, now known as simply Macon Bank, nine more branches have been opened, including another in Franklin at Holly Springs Plaza, one in Highlands, Brevard, Sylva, Cashiers, Columbus, Saluda and two in Hendersonville.
In September 2014, Macon Bank converted to a stock form of organization. Entegra Financial Corp. became the new holding company of Macon Bank. With the sale of stock completed and capital raised, Macon Bank began to offer enhanced products and services to customers in the bank’s traditional “home” communities and to expand into new markets. The Board of Directors decided the move into new markets and in February 2015 realized they would be more successful if the bank’s name were changed to Entegra Bank. This change became effective October 1, 2015. 
In 2014, the bank opened a Loan Production office in Greenville, SC. By the end of 2015, that office had become a full-service branch located at 501 Roper Mountain Road. The Greenville branch was soon followed by branches in Anderson and Chesnee, SC. In 2016, Entegra Bank acquired Oldtown Bank in Waynesville, NC which included a loan production office in Asheville, NC, and another loan production office was opened in Clemson, SC. Entegra Bank has agreed to purchase two Stearns Bank branches in Jasper, GA. The transaction is slated to be finalized in late February, 2017.
Entegra Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Entegra Financial Corp, headquartered in Franklin, NC.
