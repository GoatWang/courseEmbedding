Early life and education[edit]
Herman was born on July 16, 1947 in Mobile, Alabama, the daughter of politician Alex Herman and schoolteacher Gloria Caponis. She grew up in a Catholic home[1] in Mobile and earned her high school diploma in 1965 from the Heart of Mary High School. She briefly attended Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin, and Spring Hill College in Mobile, but transferred to Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, where she became an active member of the Gamma Alpha Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority[2] and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1969.
Herman was Queen of Carnival for the Mobile Area Mardi Gras Association (Mobile's African-American Mardi Gras umbrella organization) in 1974. Her Carnival king, Douglas Wicks, would go on to become the first African-American elected to the Mobile County Commission since Reconstruction.[3]
Career[edit]
After college, Herman worked for Catholic Charities and other agencies, advocating for minority women employment. Jimmy Carter met the young Herman while campaigning in Atlanta, Georgia and, after winning the White House in 1977, asked her to be Director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau. At age 29, she was the youngest person to ever serve in that position.[4]




Herman's official U.S. Department of Labor portrait.


In 1981, Herman founded her own consulting firm - A.M. Herman & Associates. She served as president of the company while remaining active in Democratic politics. During her tenure as chief of staff and later vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, she was responsible for organizing the 1992 Democratic National Convention.
After Bill Clinton's victory in the 1992 Presidential election, Herman became deputy director of the Presidential Transition Office. She was later appointed to head the White House Office of Public Liaison, where she was responsible for the administration's relations with interest groups.
During Clinton's second term, Herman was named Secretary of Labor, the first African American to be nominated for that position and the fifth woman to be appointed. Her nomination was initially opposed by Congressional Republicans and labor unions, but she earned praise from her peers for her handling of the 1997 UPS workers strike.
Herman came under investigation for allegedly accepting kickbacks while working at the White House. She was the 5th cabinet officer be investigated by independent counsel. In 2000 the independent counsel concluded that Herman had broken no laws and cleared her of all wrongdoing.[5] She was also mentioned in connection with the Commerce Department trade mission controversy.
During the 2000 Florida election recount, Herman was part of team planning a transition to a Gore Administration, and she was mentioned as a likely candidate for White House Chief of Staff. She was replaced as Secretary of Labor in the George W. Bush administration by Elaine Chao.
Herman now serves as the co-chairperson (with James Roosevelt, Jr.) of the Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee.[6][7][8]
Herman also now serves on the boards of several major companies, including The Coca-Cola Company's Human Resources Task Force, Toyota's Diversity Advisory Board, Cummins, MGM Resorts International, Entergy, Sodexo, and Prudential and is the chairman and CEO of New Ventures, Inc.[citation needed]

Early life and education[edit]
Herman was born on July 16, 1947 in Mobile, Alabama, the daughter of politician Alex Herman and schoolteacher Gloria Caponis. She grew up in a Catholic home[1] in Mobile and earned her high school diploma in 1965 from the Heart of Mary High School. She briefly attended Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin, and Spring Hill College in Mobile, but transferred to Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, where she became an active member of the Gamma Alpha Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority[2] and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1969.
Herman was Queen of Carnival for the Mobile Area Mardi Gras Association (Mobile's African-American Mardi Gras umbrella organization) in 1974. Her Carnival king, Douglas Wicks, would go on to become the first African-American elected to the Mobile County Commission since Reconstruction.[3]
Career[edit]
After college, Herman worked for Catholic Charities and other agencies, advocating for minority women employment. Jimmy Carter met the young Herman while campaigning in Atlanta, Georgia and, after winning the White House in 1977, asked her to be Director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau. At age 29, she was the youngest person to ever serve in that position.[4]




Herman's official U.S. Department of Labor portrait.


In 1981, Herman founded her own consulting firm - A.M. Herman & Associates. She served as president of the company while remaining active in Democratic politics. During her tenure as chief of staff and later vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, she was responsible for organizing the 1992 Democratic National Convention.
After Bill Clinton's victory in the 1992 Presidential election, Herman became deputy director of the Presidential Transition Office. She was later appointed to head the White House Office of Public Liaison, where she was responsible for the administration's relations with interest groups.
During Clinton's second term, Herman was named Secretary of Labor, the first African American to be nominated for that position and the fifth woman to be appointed. Her nomination was initially opposed by Congressional Republicans and labor unions, but she earned praise from her peers for her handling of the 1997 UPS workers strike.
Herman came under investigation for allegedly accepting kickbacks while working at the White House. She was the 5th cabinet officer be investigated by independent counsel. In 2000 the independent counsel concluded that Herman had broken no laws and cleared her of all wrongdoing.[5] She was also mentioned in connection with the Commerce Department trade mission controversy.
During the 2000 Florida election recount, Herman was part of team planning a transition to a Gore Administration, and she was mentioned as a likely candidate for White House Chief of Staff. She was replaced as Secretary of Labor in the George W. Bush administration by Elaine Chao.
Herman now serves as the co-chairperson (with James Roosevelt, Jr.) of the Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee.[6][7][8]
Herman also now serves on the boards of several major companies, including The Coca-Cola Company's Human Resources Task Force, Toyota's Diversity Advisory Board, Cummins, MGM Resorts International, Entergy, Sodexo, and Prudential and is the chairman and CEO of New Ventures, Inc.[citation needed]

Biographical notes:

Alexis Margaret Herman was born July 16, 1947 in Mobile, Alabama, a daughter of Alex Herman and Gloria Caponis. She received
                        a B.A. in Sociology in 1969 from Xavier University of New Orleans, Louisiana. She married Dr. Charles Franklin. After college,
                        she worked for Catholic Charities and other agencies advocating minority women employment. In 1977, she became Director of
                        the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor, serving until 1981. In 1981, she founded the consulting firm, A.M. Herman &
                        Associates. During her tenure as chief of staff and later vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, Herman was responsible
                        for organizing the 1992 Democratic National Convention. Following the election of President Clinton, she became deputy director
                        of the Presidential Transition Office. She was later appointed Assistant to the President and, in 1993, Director of the White
                        House Office of Public Liaison. Herman served as Secretary of Labor from May 1, 1997 to January 20, 2001. During her tenure,
                        the priorities were a prepared workforce, a secure workforce and quality workplaces. She facilitated negotiations between
                        United Parcel Service management and Teamsters union leaders, ending a ten-day strike. Other major issues included retooling
                        the Departments' skills programs into a simpler, more efficient system; giving working people needed skills to succeed in
                        the new economy; moving people from welfare to work; and working with disadvantaged youth through the Youth Opportunity program.
                        From 1998 to 2001, independent counsel Ralph I. Lancaster investigated allegations that she solicited illegal campaign contributions
                        and engaged in influence peddling while she was White House public liaison. Following her government service, he served the
                        boards of several major companies, including Coca Cola Corporation, Toyota, Cummins, Metro Goldwyn Mayer, and Prudential.

                              are all considered in the evaluation

                              In the construction industry in the U.S., falls are the leading cause of worker fatalities. Each year, on average, between
                                 150 and 200 workers are killed and more than 100,000 are injured as a result of falls at construction sites. OSHA recognizes
                                 that accidents involving falls are generally complex events frequently involving a variety of factors. Consequently, the standard
                                 for fall protection deals with both the human and equipment-related issues in protecting workers from fall hazards. For example,
                                 employers and employees need to do the following: Where protection is required, select fall protection systems appropriate
                                 for given situations. Use proper construction and installation of safety systems. Supervise employees properly. Use safe work
                                 procedures. Train workers in the proper selection, use, and maintenance of fall protection systems.--

                              The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) receives many inquiries about the "medical surveillance" provisions
                                 of its standards. This guide is a quick reference to help you locate and implement the screening and surveillance requirements
                                 of the OSHA standards in Title 29 of Code of Federal Regulations (29 CFR). The guide provides a general overview of OSHA requirements,
                                 but is not a legal authority for compliance with them. For full details of specific compliance requirements, please consult
                                 the appropriate OSHA standard in the CFR. You can access the medical surveillance provisions of the OSHA standards on the
                                 Internet at www.osha.gov

Early life and education[edit]
Herman was born on July 16, 1947 in Mobile, Alabama, the daughter of politician Alex Herman and schoolteacher Gloria Caponis. She grew up in a Catholic home[1] in Mobile and earned her high school diploma in 1965 from the Heart of Mary High School. She briefly attended Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin, and Spring Hill College in Mobile, but transferred to Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, where she became an active member of the Gamma Alpha Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority[2] and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1969.
Herman was Queen of Carnival for the Mobile Area Mardi Gras Association (Mobile's African-American Mardi Gras umbrella organization) in 1974. Her Carnival king, Douglas Wicks, would go on to become the first African-American elected to the Mobile County Commission since Reconstruction.[3]
Career[edit]
After college, Herman worked for Catholic Charities and other agencies, advocating for minority women employment. Jimmy Carter met the young Herman while campaigning in Atlanta, Georgia and, after winning the White House in 1977, asked her to be Director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau. At age 29, she was the youngest person to ever serve in that position.[4]




Herman's official U.S. Department of Labor portrait.


In 1981, Herman founded her own consulting firm - A.M. Herman & Associates. She served as president of the company while remaining active in Democratic politics. During her tenure as chief of staff and later vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, she was responsible for organizing the 1992 Democratic National Convention.
After Bill Clinton's victory in the 1992 Presidential election, Herman became deputy director of the Presidential Transition Office. She was later appointed to head the White House Office of Public Liaison, where she was responsible for the administration's relations with interest groups.
During Clinton's second term, Herman was named Secretary of Labor, the first African American to be nominated for that position and the fifth woman to be appointed. Her nomination was initially opposed by Congressional Republicans and labor unions, but she earned praise from her peers for her handling of the 1997 UPS workers strike.
Herman came under investigation for allegedly accepting kickbacks while working at the White House. She was the 5th cabinet officer be investigated by independent counsel. In 2000 the independent counsel concluded that Herman had broken no laws and cleared her of all wrongdoing.[5] She was also mentioned in connection with the Commerce Department trade mission controversy.
During the 2000 Florida election recount, Herman was part of team planning a transition to a Gore Administration, and she was mentioned as a likely candidate for White House Chief of Staff. She was replaced as Secretary of Labor in the George W. Bush administration by Elaine Chao.
Herman now serves as the co-chairperson (with James Roosevelt, Jr.) of the Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee.[6][7][8]
Herman also now serves on the boards of several major companies, including The Coca-Cola Company's Human Resources Task Force, Toyota's Diversity Advisory Board, Cummins, MGM Resorts International, Entergy, Sodexo, and Prudential and is the chairman and CEO of New Ventures, Inc.[citation needed]

Early life and education[edit]
Herman was born on July 16, 1947 in Mobile, Alabama, the daughter of politician Alex Herman and schoolteacher Gloria Caponis. She grew up in a Catholic home[1] in Mobile and earned her high school diploma in 1965 from the Heart of Mary High School. She briefly attended Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin, and Spring Hill College in Mobile, but transferred to Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, where she became an active member of the Gamma Alpha Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority[2] and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1969.
Herman was Queen of Carnival for the Mobile Area Mardi Gras Association (Mobile's African-American Mardi Gras umbrella organization) in 1974. Her Carnival king, Douglas Wicks, would go on to become the first African-American elected to the Mobile County Commission since Reconstruction.[3]
Career[edit]
After college, Herman worked for Catholic Charities and other agencies, advocating for minority women employment. Jimmy Carter met the young Herman while campaigning in Atlanta, Georgia and, after winning the White House in 1977, asked her to be Director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau. At age 29, she was the youngest person to ever serve in that position.[4]




Herman's official U.S. Department of Labor portrait.


In 1981, Herman founded her own consulting firm - A.M. Herman & Associates. She served as president of the company while remaining active in Democratic politics. During her tenure as chief of staff and later vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, she was responsible for organizing the 1992 Democratic National Convention.
After Bill Clinton's victory in the 1992 Presidential election, Herman became deputy director of the Presidential Transition Office. She was later appointed to head the White House Office of Public Liaison, where she was responsible for the administration's relations with interest groups.
During Clinton's second term, Herman was named Secretary of Labor, the first African American to be nominated for that position and the fifth woman to be appointed. Her nomination was initially opposed by Congressional Republicans and labor unions, but she earned praise from her peers for her handling of the 1997 UPS workers strike.
Herman came under investigation for allegedly accepting kickbacks while working at the White House. She was the 5th cabinet officer be investigated by independent counsel. In 2000 the independent counsel concluded that Herman had broken no laws and cleared her of all wrongdoing.[5] She was also mentioned in connection with the Commerce Department trade mission controversy.
During the 2000 Florida election recount, Herman was part of team planning a transition to a Gore Administration, and she was mentioned as a likely candidate for White House Chief of Staff. She was replaced as Secretary of Labor in the George W. Bush administration by Elaine Chao.
Herman now serves as the co-chairperson (with James Roosevelt, Jr.) of the Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee.[6][7][8]
Herman also now serves on the boards of several major companies, including The Coca-Cola Company's Human Resources Task Force, Toyota's Diversity Advisory Board, Cummins, MGM Resorts International, Entergy, Sodexo, and Prudential and is the chairman and CEO of New Ventures, Inc.[citation needed]

Early life and education[edit]
Herman was born on July 16, 1947 in Mobile, Alabama, the daughter of politician Alex Herman and schoolteacher Gloria Caponis. She grew up in a Catholic home[1] in Mobile and earned her high school diploma in 1965 from the Heart of Mary High School. She briefly attended Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin, and Spring Hill College in Mobile, but transferred to Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, where she became an active member of the Gamma Alpha Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority[2] and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1969.
Herman was Queen of Carnival for the Mobile Area Mardi Gras Association (Mobile's African-American Mardi Gras umbrella organization) in 1974. Her Carnival king, Douglas Wicks, would go on to become the first African-American elected to the Mobile County Commission since Reconstruction.[3]
Career[edit]
After college, Herman worked for Catholic Charities and other agencies, advocating for minority women employment. Jimmy Carter met the young Herman while campaigning in Atlanta, Georgia and, after winning the White House in 1977, asked her to be Director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau. At age 29, she was the youngest person to ever serve in that position.[4]




Herman's official U.S. Department of Labor portrait.


In 1981, Herman founded her own consulting firm - A.M. Herman & Associates. She served as president of the company while remaining active in Democratic politics. During her tenure as chief of staff and later vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, she was responsible for organizing the 1992 Democratic National Convention.
After Bill Clinton's victory in the 1992 Presidential election, Herman became deputy director of the Presidential Transition Office. She was later appointed to head the White House Office of Public Liaison, where she was responsible for the administration's relations with interest groups.
During Clinton's second term, Herman was named Secretary of Labor, the first African American to be nominated for that position and the fifth woman to be appointed. Her nomination was initially opposed by Congressional Republicans and labor unions, but she earned praise from her peers for her handling of the 1997 UPS workers strike.
Herman came under investigation for allegedly accepting kickbacks while working at the White House. She was the 5th cabinet officer be investigated by independent counsel. In 2000 the independent counsel concluded that Herman had broken no laws and cleared her of all wrongdoing.[5] She was also mentioned in connection with the Commerce Department trade mission controversy.
During the 2000 Florida election recount, Herman was part of team planning a transition to a Gore Administration, and she was mentioned as a likely candidate for White House Chief of Staff. She was replaced as Secretary of Labor in the George W. Bush administration by Elaine Chao.
Herman now serves as the co-chairperson (with James Roosevelt, Jr.) of the Democratic National Committee's Rules and Bylaws Committee.[6][7][8]
Herman also now serves on the boards of several major companies, including The Coca-Cola Company's Human Resources Task Force, Toyota's Diversity Advisory Board, Cummins, MGM Resorts International, Entergy, Sodexo, and Prudential and is the chairman and CEO of New Ventures, Inc.[citation needed]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
