(Does not search for items or products) SearchTipsHow do I pay my selling fees?When you set up your seller account, you specify an automatic payment method to pay your seller fees. You can also pay fees with a onetime payment. If you make a onetime payment, check your billing cycle date to make sure you allow at least 5 days between your scheduled automatic payment and your onetime payment to prevent duplicate payments.
You can update your checking account information or remove a payment method from your account any time. 

Make a onetime payment now
Ways you can pay
You can pay your seller fees in several ways: 
PayPal 
PayPal is a safe, convenient way to pay your eBay fees. When you sign up for monthly PayPal payments, your amount due is automatically deducted from your PayPal account each month. You can also make a onetime payment using your PayPal account. Automatic credit card payments
Each month, we automatically charge your fees directly to the credit card you place on file. Your credit card is usually charged 5 to 7 days after you receive your invoice. You can also make a onetime payment with your credit card. Direct pay from your checking account
Direct Pay is available to sellers who are billed in US dollars with US bank accounts. With Direct Pay, we automatically deduct your seller fees from your checking account on the same day each month. To sign up for Direct Pay, you need to provide your bank account and routing number, which are shown on the bottom of your checks. You can also make a onetime Direct Pay payment from your checking account. Your payment will be posted to your account within 2 business days.Check
 (for businesses only)
It may take up to 10 business days after we receive your check to process and post the payment to your account. When paying by check, submit a payment coupon along with your check and mail it to the address on the coupon. Allow 10 business days plus delivery time between the date you mail the payment and your payment due date.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
